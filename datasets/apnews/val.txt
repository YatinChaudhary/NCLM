walking through shelves packed with documents memorializing north carolina 's past , gov. pat mccrory on tuesday promoted his administration 's effort to modernize the state 's death records .	the governor , his budget director and the health and human services secretary visited the nondescript vital records building to highlight his budget proposal that includes nearly $ 2 million to help create an electronic death records reporting system .	north carolina is just one of four states without such a system , according to officials . "	we 're still in the horse-and-buggy era , " with death records , mccrory said .	the state vital records office processes 83,000 death records annually using a paper-intensive method that can take 90 days to complete a new certificate .	the governor 's group visited two vaults of books containing certificates for those born in north carolina from 1913 to 1935 and death records since the 1980s .	other certificates considered historical are held by the state office of archives and history in paper and on microfilm .	north carolina births have been reported through a paperless system since 2010 .	an electronic system for deaths would make record-keeping more efficient , reduce fraud and respond to citizen requests more quickly , according to mccrory .	an electronic reporting system also could reduce the issuance time to seven days , speeding up end-of-life issues such as wills and benefits . "	it 's the right thing to do toward the citizens and the families to settle their estate , to be able to allow them to move on with the most difficult journey of life , which is death , " health and human services secretary dr. aldona wos said .	the current death report process begins with a funeral director filling out a form and taking it to a physician to sign .	it next goes to the local health department and is ultimately mailed to raleigh before the official recording .	all told , a new reporting system would take nearly four years to build , wos said , and cost more than $ 5 million , requiring money beyond the two year budget being debated .	rep. marilyn avila , r-wake , a house budget writer on health matters , said later tuesday that she and her colleagues have n't looked closely at the request but said the current system 's shortcomings will be weighed with other priorities in the health department .	although the death records system spending wo n't immediately create net savings , the recommendation " just provides better customer service to the citizens of the state , " state budget director lee roberts said .	the department of health and human services also estimates it could save the state 's 2,200 funeral homes at least $ 6.8 million combined in travel time , personnel costs and lost productivity because directors will need less time to locate physicians and transport records around town .	the tour also highlighted mccrory 's push to renovate aging government buildings , particularly in downtown raleigh , and preserve state history .	the early 20th century birth records in the vault have little protecting them beyond a fire suppression system .	and the process of digitizing all records is still way off in the future .

moving on national and lifestyle wires .	@ by wendy koch usa today erin bodmer 's home now has a rain barrel , thanks to a workshop her girl scout troop attended on how to build one . "	we water the plants with the rainwater , " says bodmer , 8 , a bright-eyed third-grader from owings , md. .	she 'll soon be making birdhouses from old coffee cans for her school 's new nature trail , built by a senior girl scout .	welcome to today 's girl scouts of the usa .	while the organization has always strived to create stewards of nature , it 's stepping up its green efforts as it prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary in march 2012 . "	we 're taking it to a new level , " says harriet hessam , the group 's centennial project director .	last year , it published new handbooks , " it 's your planet - love it ! "	that teach girls about the environment , including the negative impact of eating meat and drinking bottled water .	it launched the " girl scouts forever green " project to challenge scouts to save energy and water .	the project , which began in 10 councils and will be expanded nationwide , lets members track their specific accomplishments online .	last year , its participants said they collectively saved 42,000 gallons of water .	the girls also are composting trash at school and learning to do energy audits .	on saturday , bodmer 's troop , along with dozens of others , learned about endangered species and conservation at the national air and space museum 's steven f. udvar-hazy center in chantilly , va. .	on the same day , 3,000 miles away in mill valley , calif. , other girl scouts were removing ice plants along the waterways , because they tend to choke out native plants .	in a 2008 survey , members of the girls scouts picked the environment as the most important issue for them . "	we are where the girls are .	right now , environmental action is very important to them .	we allow them to lead us , " says michelle tompkins , spokeswoman of girl scouts of the usa .	the scouts ' green efforts are playing out in big and small ways : - in massachusetts , as part of " project re-runway , " girls have learned to make outfits using only recycled materials .	- in the washington , d.c. , area , they 've changed 4,276 light bulbs so far , switching from incandescents to more efficient compact fluorescent bulbs , mostly in their own homes .	they 've also distributed donated , reusable grocery bags in the city , which in january began to charge 5 cents for each plastic bag a shopper uses .	- in norridge , ill. , near chicago , joanne dynak , a 15-year-old girl scout , says her troop 's recycling has expanded from aluminum cans to plastic bottles and newspapers , collected at church .	- about an hour southwest of denver , cindy orton says her troop planted 210 trees last year in a forest damaged by the 2002 hayman fire and plans to spend more than $ 600 of its cookie sale profits to plant 420 more this year .	today , the third-graders plan to test how much water the low-flow toilets in their school are saving .	in addition , the girl scouts organization is starting to green its own buildings .	in november in newark , del. , its science and technology lodge became the first building in the state to win the top or platinum rating from the u.s. green building council .	its rooftop solar panels produce 60 percent of its electricity , and its cisterns reuse rainwater for irrigation and toilet flushing .	in san antonio , the sally cheever girl scout leadership center , which opened in 2007 , has two 8,000 gallon cisterns that are used to teach scouts about rainwater harvesting .	the girl scouts also continue to offer nature-oriented camps . "	we believe when they experience nature , they get more involved , " says dana allen , spokeswoman of girl scouts of northern california .	in the san francisco bay area , she says girls learned about watersheds by canoeing .	at the boy scouts of america , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year , spokeswoman renee fairrer says she can not speak to a single new green initiative , because the organization remains as committed as always to helping build and clean up parks and trails . "	while it 's now politically correct to be green , it 's what boy scouts of america has done since its beginning , " fairrer says , citing the boy scouts involvement in recycling , conservation and tree planting efforts .	dynak of illinois , who has been a girl scout since age 5 , says protecting the environment is critical .

south dakota lawmakers are making a last-minute attempt to pass a measure banning texting while driving before the main run of this year 's legislative session ends friday .	the bill was thought to be dead tuesday when a negotiating committee of house and senate members failed to reach agreement .	but the house and senate have appointed new members to the negotiating committee .	rep. charlie hoffman of eureka , chair of the negotiating committee , says he thinks negotiators can reach agreement when it meets thursday .	hoffman says a proposed compromise would make texting while driving a secondary offense , meaning law officers could issue tickets for the offense only after first stopping drivers for other traffic violations .	he says the penalty would start at $ 100 but increase for repeat offenses .
joran van der sloot can be charming , angry , deceitful , tearful .	the young dutchman has been all that and more , playing out his troubled drama on tv over the five years since he came under suspicion in the disappearance of american teenager natalee holloway in aruba .	by his own admission , half of what he says is a lie .	twice arrested and released for lack of evidence in the holloway case , van der sloot was taken into custody again last week in connection with the slaying in peru of stephany flores , a 21-year-old college student police say he met while playing poker at a lima casino .	her may 30 killing came five years to the day after holloway disappeared .	towering over the peruvian officers flanking him , the 6-foot-3-inch dutchman appeared sullen and moist-eyed this weekend when he was paraded before journalists in handcuffs and a bulletproof vest after he was caught and extradited from chile .	chilean police said van der sloot told investigators he was innocent in the case .	he was much more subdued than during his earlier appearances on american and dutch tv , where he has become something of a minor celebrity ?	feeding public curiosity by spinning contradictory stories about holloway 's final hours and sometimes displaying flashes of a volatile temper .	once , at the end of a relaxed interview with dutch crime reporter peter de vries , van der sloot threw a glass of wine in the reporter 's eyes .	aad schalke , a dutch private investigator who administered a polygraph to van der sloot for a tv show about the holloway case aired last year , said he was not surprised the 22-year-old was in trouble again . "	the moment he 's not in control any more , he can be really dangerous , " the detective told the associated press on monday .	van der sloot is the son of a respected lawyer in aruba who died in february .	he was 17 when holloway disappeared in 2005 and he spent three months in detention , then returned to the netherlands to study .	two years later , he was arrested again and sent back to aruba for further questioning .	it 's unclear how he supported himself when he was n't in jail .	he is an avid gambler , and reportedly spent much of the last two years in thailand , where de vries claimed in 2008 van der sloot was recruiting thai women for the sex trade in the netherlands .	just days after the slaying in peru , van der sloot was charged in the united states with trying to extort $ 250,000 from holloway 's family in exchange for disclosing the location of her body and describing how she died .	u.s. prosecutors say $ 15,000 was transferred to a dutch bank account in his name .	van der sloot has told conflicting stories of his involvement with the alabama teen .	he and two surinamese brothers , satish and deepak kalpoe , were the last to see the 18-year-old honors student , who was on a school trip to aruba to celebrate her high school graduation .	he initially told island police he took holloway to her hotel , then later said he left her alive and well on the beach .	he apologized for lying earlier .	at other times he claimed holloway collapsed and died on the beach , and he dumped the body in the ocean .	on another occasion he said her body was taken to a marsh .	in a lengthy 2006 interview with greta van susteren on fox news , van der sloot described drinking shots of rum with holloway , whom he said he met while playing poker at an aruba casino , then taking her to a beach and leaving her there around 3:30 a.m. .	in de vries ' 2008 dutch television documentary , van der sloot said during a secretly recorded conversation that holloway was drunk and slumped to the sand as they were kissing . "	suddenly she started shaking and then she did n't say anything , " van der sloot said in dutch , adding that he did not kill her . "	i would never murder a girl . "	the interview prompted authorities in aruba to reopen the case , but van der sloot later said he made up the whole story and he was not charged . "	i have a busy imagination and it was one big lie .	... nothing 's true , " he told interviewer jaap amesz in a show broadcast on dutch tv last year .	he told amesz yet one more story .	holloway was dancing on a balcony when she accidentally fell over the railing , he said , his eyes filling with tears .	amesz , who had arranged for the polygraph test , asked van der sloot if half of everything he said was a lie . "	oh , more than half , " he replied .	van der sloot 's lie detector test lent support to that admission .	annette heldens , the investigator who questioned van der sloot , said he continuously squirmed in his chair to throw off the polygraph machine . "	he tried to manipulate the results , " she said .	nonetheless , she said the test showed he lied when he repeatedly answered " no , " to questions about whether he was involved in holloway 's disappearance or death .	polygraph tests are inadmissible as evidence in the netherlands , and schalke said police did not follow up after the results were broadcast on tv .	after van der sloot was shown the test results , amesz asked him on camera what he thought the consequences would be .	rather than answer , he grabbed a glass of water from the table , spun out of his chair and smashed it in fury against a wall .
a somali-born teenager plotted " a spectacular show " of terrorism for months , saying he did n't mind that children would die if he bombed a crowded christmas tree-lighting ceremony , according to a law-enforcement official and court documents .	he never got the chance .	mohamed osman mohamud , 19 , was arrested friday in downtown portland after using a cell phone to try to detonate what he thought were explosives in a van , prosecutors said .	it turned out to be a dummy bomb put together by fbi agents , and authorities said the public was never in danger .	the case is the latest in a string of alleged terrorist planning by u.s. citizens or residents , including a times square plot in which a pakistan-born man pleaded guilty earlier this year to trying to set off a car bomb at a busy street corner .	in the portland plot , mohamud believed he was receiving help from a larger ring of jihadists as he communicated with undercover agents , but a law enforcement official who was n't authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on a condition of anonymity told the associated press that no foreign terrorist organization was directing him .	the official said mohamud planned the details , including where to park the van to hurt the most people . "	i want whoever is attending that event to leave , to leave dead or injured , " mohamud said , according to the affidavit .	thousands of people gathered friday on a cold , clear night for the annual event at pioneer courthouse square , a plaza known as " portland 's living room . "	just 10 minutes before mohamud 's 5:40 p.m. arrest , babies were sitting on shoulders , and children cheered at the first appearance of santa claus onstage .	the tree-lighting went off without a hitch .	mohamud graduated from high school in beaverton .	he was enrolled at oregon state university over the past year but withdrawing oct. 6 , the school said .	the law enforcement official who spoke to the ap said agents began investigating mohamud after receiving a tip from someone concerned about him .	the official declined providing further more detail about the relationship between the two .	the fbi monitored mohamud 's e-mail and found he was in contact with people overseas , asking how he could travel to pakistan and join the fight for jihad , according to an fbi affidavit .	the law enforcement official said mohamud e-mailed a friend living in pakistan who had been a student in oregon in 2007-2008 and been in yemen as well .	the e-mail exchanges led the fbi to believe that mohamud 's friend in pakistan " had joined others involved in terrorist activities " and was inviting mohamud to join him , according to the affidavit .	for reasons unexplained , mohamud tried to board a flight to kodiak , alaska , from portland on june 14 , was n't allowed to board and was interviewed by the fbi , the affidavit states .	mohamud told the fbi he wanted to earn money fishing and then travel to join " the brothers . "	he said he had previously hoped to travel to yemen but had never obtained a ticket or a visa .	on june 23 , an agent e-mailed mohamud , pretending to be affiliated with the " unindicted associate . "	the fbi 's affidavit said the friend in pakistan referred him to another associate , but gave him an address mohamud repeatedly tried e-mailing unsuccessfully .	the official said fbi agents saw that as an opportunity and e-mailed in response , claiming to be associates of mohamud 's friend , the former student .	the affidavit said mohamud was warned several times about the seriousness of his plan , that women and children could die , and that he could back out .	but he told agents : " since i was 15 i thought about all this , " and " it 's gon na be a fireworks show ... a spectacular show . "	mohamud , a naturalized u.s. citizen , was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison .	a court appearance was set for monday .	authorities allowed the plot to proceed to build up enough evidence to charge the suspect with attempt .	white house spokesman nick shapiro said saturday that president barack obama was aware of the fbi operation before friday 's arrest .	shapiro said obama was assured that the fbi was in full control of the operation , and the public was not in danger .	authorities said mohamud sent bomb components to undercover fbi agents he believed were assembling the explosive device , but the agents supplied the fake bomb that mohamud tried to detonate twice via his phone .	the fbi affidavit said the undercover agent first met mohamud in person on july 30 and asked what he would do for the cause of jihad , suggesting he might want to spread islam to others , continue studies to help the cause overseas , raise money , become " operational " or become a martyr .	mohamud responded that he wanted to become " operational " but needed training , the affidavit said .	when mohamud was asked what he meant by " operational , " he responded that he wanted to put together an explosion , the affidavit said .	the undercover agent said he could introduce him to an explosives expert and asked mohamud to research potential targets .	at a second meeting on aug. 19 at a portland hotel , the agent brought another undercover agent , the documents said , and mohamud told them he had selected pioneer courthouse square for the bombing .	on nov. 4 , the court documents say , mohamud made a video in the presence of one of the undercover agents , putting on clothes he described as " sheik osama style : " a white robe , red and white headdress , and camouflage jacket .	he read a statement speaking of his dream of bringing " a dark day " on americans and blaming his family for thwarting him , according to the court documents : " to my parents who held me back from jihad in the cause of allah .	i say to them ... if you ?	if you make allies with the enemy , then allah 's power ... will ask you about that on the day of judgment , and nothing that you do can hold me back ... " friday , an agent and mohamud drove to portland in a white van that carried six 55-gallon drums with detonation cords and plastic caps , but all of them were inert , the complaint states .	they left the van near the downtown ceremony site and went to a train station where mohamud was given a cell phone that he thought would blow up the vehicle , according to the complaint .	there was no detonation when he dialed , and when he tried again federal agents and police made their move .	tens of thousands of somalis have resettled in the united states since their country plunged into lawlessness in 1991 , and the u.s. has boosted aid to the country .	in august , the u.s. justice department unsealed an indictment naming 14 people accused of being a deadly pipeline routing money and fighters from the u.s. to al-shabab , an al-qaida affiliated group in mohamud 's native somalia .	fbi agent e.k. wilson said there is no apparent connection between the bomb plot in portland and the investigation he 's overseeing into about 20 men who left minneapolis to join al-shabab in somalia .	officials have been working with muslim leaders across the united states , particularly with the somali community in minnesota , trying to combat the radicalization .	on saturday , omar jamal , first secretary to the somali mission to the united nations and an advocate for somalis in minnesota , said mohamud has a stepmother in minneapolis .	he condemned the plot and urged somalis to cooperate with police and the fbi .	jamal said he had spoken to two somalis who knew mohamud , and he was described as religious and quiet .	jamal said mohamud is from southern somalia . "	everybody 's afraid , really really afraid , " jamal said of members of oregon 's somali communities and elsewhere . "	they 're afraid of , first of all , the label .	the allegation is very serious ... "
and just vanishing can leave you feeling guilty and your provider wondering what went wrong .	here are some better tactics to consider : - put out warning signs .

"	when parting ways with someone who relies heavily on you for income -- such as a live-in nanny or housekeeper -- then warnings are n't enough , she says .	in those cases , " give plenty of notice , " speyer says .

"	a breakup does n't have to be done in person , " speyer says .	but it should n't be done via text message .	it 's too impersonal , and does n't give much room for explanation , she says .	- practice .	( at ) if the decision is to sever ties verbally , then rehearse it . "	preparation is key -- know what you 're going to say ahead of time , " speyer says .	mentally prepare for a variety of different responses , says clinical psychologist maryann troiani . "	there might be extreme reactions " such as anger or begging for another chance .	- be honest and calm .	( at ) " have candor , without being accusatory or hostile , " levine says . "	explain that it 's just not working for you -- you do n't have enough money or you want to try something new .	you do n't need to go into explicit detail .	keep it on a surface level .

two powder river basin coal companies are at odds over the effect of an obama administration proposal that would change the way royalties are collected on coal mined from federal land .	peabody energy and cloud peak energy both oppose a u.s. department of the interior proposal to assess a royalty on the first sale between non-affiliated companies .	royalties today are levied on the first sale , regardless of the affiliation of the parties involved .	the casper star-tribune reports ( http://tinyurl.com/q2rc955 ) the disagreement is over what the change means for the future of mines operating on federal land .	peabody says the proposal will have little effect on its mining operations .	cloud peak says it could greatly limit powder river basin exports to asia .	the contrasting positions reflect , in part , the two companies ' business positions .	peabody is the world 's largest privately owned coal company and operates mines in the united states and australia .	the firm 's australian mines already export coal to asia , whereas its powder river basin mines principally supply the american market . "	since this change mostly impacts exports , it is less impactful to them than some of their competitors who are exclusively domestic , " said kristoffer inton , an analyst who tracks the industry at morningstar .	cloud peak is solely based in the powder river basin .	and while exports still make up a fraction of the company 's present sales , the gillette-based firm is pushing to expand its asian footprint .	the company has recently acquired more terminal space at ports in british columbia to ship coal abroad and is advocating for the construction of new coal ports in the pacific northwest .	a recent cloud peak investor presentation estimated the company 's exports would grow from 11 million tons in 2014 to 75 million tons by 2020 .	cloud peak has cast the royalty proposal as the latest front in what it terms the obama administration 's " war on coal . " "	we believe the rule is designed to inhibit coal exports from the powder river basin and could , if unchanged , cost montana and wyoming access to a potential 100-million ton export market at a time when declines in the domestic market projected as a result of the clean power plan mean these states could face serious budget shortfalls in the near future , " rick curtsinger , a cloud peak spokesman , wrote in an email .	the clean power plan is a u.s. environmental protection agency proposal to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants by 30 percent of their 2005 levels in the next 15 years .	interior 's coal-royalty plan comes in response to a rising number of transactions between mines and affiliated companies .	mines sell to their subsidiaries , which then market and ship coal for a higher price to buyers abroad .	cloud peak and other mining interests have said the interior proposal constitutes a double tax , levying a royalty on the value of the coal and the cost of shipping it .	fiscal watchdogs and environmentalists contend the practice opens the door to market manipulation , with companies potentially selling to their affiliates at artificially low prices and paying less in royalties .	peabody spokeswoman charlene murdock said that while the company anticipates little impact from the proposal , it still opposes the plan . "	the proposed rule creates complex regulatory policy and peabody energy does not feel the change is necessary , " murdock said .
the food and drug administration said monday that the three companies must submit plans to study how well hospital staffers actually follow instructions for disinfecting the scopes between uses .	the agency hopes this information will shed light on a recent spate of infections involving antibiotic-resistant " superbugs " linked to the scopes .	the fda issued the instructions to olympus american , fuji medical systems and hoya corp. .	all three companies are based in japan but do business through u.s. affiliates .	olympus american accounts for 85 percent of the specialized scopes sold in the u.s. , according to figures from the fda .	the fda came under fire earlier this year after two separate outbreaks at los angeles hospitals were linked to so-called duodenoscopes .	the specialized fiber-optic scopes are threaded through the digestive tract to diagnose and treat gallstones , tumors and blockages of the pancreas and bile ducts .	officials at both hospitals said they had followed the manufacturers ' instructions for cleaning the devices .	since 2013 , there have been at least eight outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria linked to the devices at u.s. hospitals , according to government figures .	such problems have been linked to scopes from all three manufacturers that sell the devices in the u.s. despite the links to infections , the fda previously ruled it would keep the devices on the market because they fill an important need in a half-million procedures performed each year .	duodenoscopes feature a mechanized tip with moveable instruments used to drain blockages and perform other procedures .	the complex design makes the scopes extremely difficult to clean .	bodily fluids and other debris can stay in the device 's joints and crevices even after cleaning and disinfection .

aug. 13 , 1967 , marked one of the most tragic and important events in the history of glacier national park .	two women , in campsites miles apart from one another , were mauled and killed by grizzly bears , the first bear-related fatalities since the park 's inaugural year .	it is known as " night of the grizzlies , " a story with enough gravity to grab national headlines and cause the national park system to re-examine wildlife policies .	it was also an incident forever burned into the hearts and minds of those involved , as well as the park 's widespread community .	montanapbs is revisiting the story with the documentary , " glacier park 's night of the grizzlies , " set to debut on may 17 .	while the story may be familiar to many montanans , some of the voices in the film have never been publicly heard before , said co-producer gus chambers . "	when we started it , we kind of realized it took 40 years for a lot of the people to want to speak about it , " chambers said .	the documentary chronicles the series of events leading up to the deaths of julie helgeson and michele koons , two young park employees out for overnight camping trips with their friends .	helgeson and her friend roy ducat hiked to the granite park chalet on aug. 12 , 1967 , and were both mauled early in the morning on aug. 13 .	ducat survived his injuries ; helgeson did not .	that same night , a grizzly attacked koons and her friends at trout lake .	her friends , including paul dunn , survived by climbing trees .	koons did not make it out of her sleeping bag , according to witnesses .	both ducat and dunn share their memories of that night on the documentary , along with family members , other witnesses , biologists , journalists , park rangers and others .	missoula-native and actor j.k. simmons provides the narration .	chambers , who has worked in the park and for the u.s. park service and is based in missoula , said it was only fitting for montana filmmakers to take on this subject .	he and his co-producer writer paul zalis , who also wrote the script , approached the project sensitively , not wanting to sensationalize the deaths of two young women . "	we wanted to keep this as respectful for the survivors , for the families and for bears as possible , " chambers said . "	who better than a local to try to take it on ? "	much of the documentary focuses on the state of wildlife policy in the park in the 1960s and 1970s .	it was regular to feed the bears garbage or to give them food to attract them to cars or tourist-centric destinations in the park .	hikers and campers also did not have the pack-it-in , pack-it-out mentality they do today .	this meant trash at campgrounds to draw in the hungry bears , which were becoming increasingly unafraid of humans , according to biologists .	the filmmakers mixed old footage , still-frame re-enactments and old photographs to create a seamless storyline , chambers said .	this meant shooting film at granite park chalet and other locales .	glacier park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said the park felt comfortable with the documentary because of the respectful nature of the script . "	the night of the grizzlies " was a deafening alarm telling national parks that humans and wildlife need to be separated , vanderbilt said . "	that was a bellwether event in bear management in national parks , not just here in glacier , " vanderbilt said . "	it changed careers , it changed policy within the park as well as within the park service , seemingly overnight . "	work on the film began three years ago , and chambers hoped it would be completed by 2007 , in time for the 40th anniversary of the event .	the story expanded , however , in ways the filmmakers did not initially expect , chambers said , and they decided to take the extra time ?	three summers ?	to tell the entire story .	the fact that the documentary is debuting during glacier 's centennial celebration this year is a coincidence , chambers said .	the park is also performing its annual evaluation of grizzly policies , vanderbilt said , which have drawn more attention than usual this year after a sow grizzly and her cubs were removed from the park last august . "	glacier national park is vigilant about trying to educate and communicate to park visitors that they must stringently keep their food and garbage and utensils out of the path of bears and animals , " vanderbilt said .	for his part , chambers believes the documentary accomplished what it set out to do by telling the story of the people involved in that terrifying night , as well as the story of the animals and the conditions that led to a tragic conclusion . "	this story is sort of glacier 's awkward adolescence , " chambers said . "	a coming-of-life event that ( the park ) learned from and grew from . "

the legislature convened tuesday for a special session focusing on the politically charged task of redistricting , which will influence elections and public policy in new mexico for the next decade .	as lawmakers returned to work , house and senate democratic leaders said redistricting was their top priority although republican gov. susana martinez wants the legislature to consider a host of other issues besides drawing new boundaries of congressional , legislative and other elective office districts .	the governor asked lawmakers to consider a packed agenda , including overturning a 2003 law allowing driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants , consolidating several executive branch agencies and giving the state as well as local governments the power to ban all fireworks during extreme drought conditions .	however , there 's no requirement that the legislature vote on any of the governor 's proposals , which were outlined in a formal proclamation issued by martinez shortly before the session convened . "	our no. 1 priority is to get redistricting done ... as quickly as we can and then we 'll look to see what we can get of the remainder of that proclamation , " said senate majority leader michael sanchez , d-belen .	the senate derailed the governor 's license proposal earlier this year when the legislature held a 60-day session .	democratic leaders contend that martinez has added it to the special session agenda to get more ammunition for next year 's legislative elections .	even before the session convened , the immigrant license proposal sparked competing demonstrations .	immigrant rights supporters gathered on one side of the capitol against martinez 's proposal .	they chanted , " jesus was an immigrant . "	tea party activists rallied on the opposite side of the building with placards reading : " licenses for legals only " and " terrorists can fly with nm licenses . "	republican lt. gov. john sanchez , the governor 's running mate last year , told the tea party rally that the immigrant license repeal measure was not motivated by race or partisan politics . "	make no mistake about it , as a proud hispanic and working shoulder to shoulder with other proud hispanics , it has nothing to do with race .	it has to do with following the law , " sanchez said of federal immigrant law requirements .	in redistricting , lawmakers must equalize district boundaries as much as possible to comply with the legal doctrine of one person , one vote .	the legislature must adjust the boundaries of new mexico 's three congressional districts as well as the 70 seats in the state house of representatives , 42 senate districts and districts for the state 's utility regulator , the public regulation commission , and the public education commission , which can approve charter schools .	redistricting , by its nature , is a highly partisan task .	democrats and republicans will jockey for a political advantage for their parties in future elections and individual legislators will fight to ensure their home districts are favorable to their re-election .	the outcome of redistricting could influence future policy decisions by helping to determine whether democrats can retain their majorities in the house and senate .	the total number of seats in the legislature will remain unchanged , but redistricting could reshuffle regional political representation .	eastern new mexico , for example , faces the prospect of losing seats in the house and senate because counties in the region grew at slower pace during the past decade than the statewide average .	districts must expand their boundaries ?	gain precincts ?	if their populations lagged behind the rest of the state and two districts may have to be combined to even out populations and make way for a new district , such as in the fast-growing west side of albuquerque .

' "	passenger angelina marty said .	another shocked passenger , andrew wai , thought , " could this be it ?	are we going down ? "	within moments sunday , a flight attendant tackled rageh almurisi .	authorities do not yet have a motive .	while almurisi , 28 , of vallejo , california , has no clear or known ties to terrorism , authorities say , the incident underscored fears that extremists may try to mount attacks to retaliate for the death of al-qaida leader osama bin laden last week .	federal agents are investigating almurisi 's background .	he was carrying a yemeni passport and a california identification card , authorities said .	yemen , a nation at the southern tip of the arabian peninsula , has been a focus of u.s. officials because one of the most active branches of al-qaida operates in a remote part of the country .	a cousin of the suspect described him as an educated , easygoing person who had arrived in northern california a year-and-a-half ago from yemen in search of better opportunities .	he was unable to find work in vallejo , a town of 100,000 across the bay from san francisco hit hard by the real estate bust , and recently moved to new york where his brother lived in search of better luck , said rageh almoraissi , 29 , of vallejo .	almurisi had not told his extended family in california that he was returning to the area , almoraissi said . "	he 's very laid back , he 's always smiling , he 's always laughing .	he 's not an angry person , " almoraissi said . "	everybody 's worried about him .	it 's not typical of him .

"	wai also said almurisi appeared " fidgety " in his seat when he saw him on the way to the bathroom earlier in the flight .	the boeing 737 carrying about 162 people landed safely at 9:10 p.m. almurisi was placed into police custody and flight attendants were trying to soothe shaken and crying passengers . "	we were all looking at our lives flash before our eyes , " said wai , a fourth-year medical student who flew in to visit his sister .	after departing the plane , wai took pictures of almurisi lying face first on the airport terminal floor with at least eight officers surrounding him and about another half-dozen officers nearby .	almurisi was later put onto a stretcher .	federal authorities took almurisi into custody monday morning after he spent the night at the san mateo county jail , said san mateo county chief deputy district attorney karen guidotti .	almurisi was being held on suspicion of interfering with a flight crew , a federal offense , authorities said .	no one else was hurt and the airport continued operating normally with security levels unchanged , rodriguez added .	there were two other mid-air disturbances elsewhere on sunday .	a 34-year-old man from illinois tried to open a plane door on a continental airlines flight from houston to chicago .	investigators questioned him , but did not file charges .	there was a security scare aboard a delta air lines flight from detroit to san diego , prompting it to land in albuquerque , new mexico .	authorities did not release any more details , except to say that " no suspicious devices " were found .	no one was arrested .

lawyers for a young army private accused of leaking a trove of classified information to the website wikileaks said tuesday that military prosecutors have withheld hundreds of emails related to his pretrial detention at a marine corps brig. david coombs , a lawyer for pfc. bradley manning , argued at a pretrial hearing that prosecutors have yet to turn over about 700 emails in their possession .	but he said the emails he 's already aware of paint a portrait of a military more concerned with combating negative publicity than with manning 's welfare and reveal that high-level officials , including a three-star general , were briefed about the conditions of his confinement .	prosecutors denied the allegations and said the general was justifiably anxious about manning 's condition and that he was a suicide risk .	manning , 24 , is accused of providing to wikileaks hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and iraq and afghanistan war logs while working as an intelligence analyst in baghdad in 2009 and 2010 .	he faces a possible life sentence .	military prosecutors and defense lawyers have been hashing out procedural and evidentiary disputes during an ongoing pretrial hearing ahead of a trial scheduled for early next year .	at issue tuesday were nearly 1,400 emails pertaining to manning 's maximum-security detention at the marine corps brig in quantico , virginia .	while there , he was confined to a single-bed cell for 23-hours a day and .	his clothing was taken from him for several nights until he was issued a suicide-prevention smock .	the conditions mobilized and infuriated manning supporters , who alleged torture and said he was illegally punished .	he has since been relocated to medium-security confinement at fort leavenworth , kansas .	coombs said manning was confined in such a way to prevent anything bad from happening to him , which the military knew would generate a crush of negative publicity . "	the main thing they were concerned about was being portrayed in a negative light , " he said .	he also said the emails show a three-star general at the brig was briefed in unusual detail about manning 's stay . "	what he 's being briefed on is not something you would expect a three-star general to be briefed on , " he said , adding , " he 's being briefed on when i call , he 's being briefed on when people ( who support manning ) are being turned away at the front gate . "	ashden fein , a military prosecutor , said the emails did n't support coombs ' theory or allegations .	he said there was nothing unusual about a general being given regular briefings about an individual soldier 's confinement , especially one who was considered a suicide risk . "	a commander being notified of what 's going on ( in ) his installation is the way the military works , " fein said .	coombs also accused prosecutors of allowing the emails to " collect dusk " for at least six months despite defense lawyers ' requests to see them .	fein said prosecutors had other pressing priorities .	prosecutors last month turned over 84 emails related to the quantico detention and provided an additional 600 or so this week .	army col. denise lind , who is presiding over the hearing , directed prosecutors to provide her with the remaining 700 emails , and she said she would individually review them to determine which ones were relevant and could be disclosed .	the hearing continues wednesday .	lind dealt defense lawyers a blow last month when she largely barred manning from presenting evidence at his trial that the mountain of classified information he 's accused of leaking did little harm to u.s. national security and foreign relations .	wikileaks , which has published numerous international diplomatic and military secrets , sees its mission as revealing secret information to the public .

"	we believe the people will be able to take this . "	he said the price hike is n't expected to cause a spike in inflation .	the move is part of long-term strategy to gradually reduce subsidies , and the next round of cuts will depend on economic conditions , he added .	malaysia 's fiscal deficit hit a 20-year high of 7 percent of gross domestic product last year .	the government hopes to trim it to 5.3 percent this year and 2.8 percent by 2015 through fuel and other subsidy cuts over the next five years .	subsidy cuts in july led to a savings of more than 750 million ringgit ( $ 242 million ) .	the government said at the time it would still spend an estimated 7.82 billion ringgit ( $ 2.5 billion ) on fuel and sugar subsidies this year .
democratic u.s. rep. chris murphy kicked off a statewide tour of businesses monday as part of his u.s. senate campaign , saying that unlike a republican rival , he wants to gather ideas from employers and employees as he travels connecticut .	murphy said his tour is different because he plans to do a lot of listening and not tell companies and their workers what he thinks needs to be done in washington to improve job growth . "	listen , i have n't been around politics for very long , but i have watched a lot of candidates or elected officials who think that just by stopping by a business for an hour , that they 've demonstrated they know what it takes to get jobs started here in connecticut , " said murphy , a former state legislator who has represented the 5th congressional district seat since 2007 .	murphy toured ad chem manufacturing technologies in manchester , which manufacturers and repairs jet engine and helicopter parts .	asked if he was trying to contrast himself with the endorsed republican candidate for senate , former wrestling executive linda mcmahon , murphy said he thinks " there are going to be a lot of contrasts " between himself and mcmahon .	she unveiled a jobs plan earlier this year that includes tax cuts for the middle class and a reduction in the corporate income tax rate . "	one of them may be , " he said , " that i 'm going to be doing a lot more listening than talking in the course of this campaign . "	mcmahon 's campaign pointed out that mcmahon held two statewide jobs tours , visiting dozens of companies , before she released her economic plan back in march .	murphy criticized mcmahon 's proposal for including " a fairly dramatic cut to education funding , " something he said would " be a disaster . "	but mcmahon 's plan , posted on her campaign website , does not mention a specific cut in education .	rather , it proposes a 1 percent reduction in federal spending , but not necessarily across-the-board reductions .	mcmahon has said there would be some spending priorities , such as defense . "	not only does congressman murphy not have a jobs or education plan , he 's never actually had a real job , " said erin isaac , mcmahon 's campaign spokeswoman . "	while he 's learning about real jobs this week , he may want to take some time to actually read linda 's jobs plan .	when he does , he 'll realize his statement today was categorically false . "	asked where he believed mcmahon was cutting education in her plan , murphy contended that mcmahon was calling for " an across-the-board cut in federal funding " and that he had n't seen " any mention in mcmahon 's plan " to increase education funding . "	if you do n't have a jobs plan that calls for increases in education and job training , than you do n't have a jobs plan , " murphy said .	murphy laid out several " pillars " of his jobs plan , including a fairer tax code , eliminating federal tax on purchases of new machinery , increasing federal funding for education and infrastructure , and extending the bush-era tax cuts for everyone but the wealthiest taxpayers and using that money to pay down debt and provide more college scholarship aid .	mcmahon 's campaign referred to murphy 's jobs tour as " campaign schtick " in a statement to reporters .	it listed a number of votes , where the campaign accuses murphy of voting against limiting " job-killing regulations " and voting to raise taxes on businesses .	both murphy and mcmahon face primary challenges on aug. 14 .	former secretary of the state susan bysiewicz is competing against murphy for the democratic nomination , while former u.s. rep. christopher shays is mcmahon 's opponent for the gop nod .

before accepting the plea , the 73-year-old republican was warned by the judge that he could go beyond the recommendation and give hastert up to five years behind bars when he is sentenced in february .	because the plea agreement has a sentencing range from no prison time to six months , u.s. district judge thomas m. durkin could also decide to put hastert on probation or home confinement .	the plea helped seal the downfall of a man who rose from obscurity in rural illinois to the nation 's third-highest political office .	during his eight years as speaker , hastert was second in the line of succession to the presidency .	as he stepped to the lectern to answer a series of questions , he spoke in a voice so soft that the judge at one point told him to speak up .	the hearing revealed no new details about why hastert agreed to pay $ 3.5 million to an unidentified person .	the indictment says the payments were meant to conceal past misconduct by hastert against that person , but it does not explain the nature of the wrongdoing .	the associated press and other media , citing anonymous sources , have reported that the payments were meant to hide claims of sexual misconduct from decades ago .	at the half-hour hearing in chicago , a subdued hastert read from a brief written statement that -- like his indictment -- focused narrowly on how he technically broke banking laws .	by pleading guilty , hastert avoids a trial that could have divulged the embarrassing secrets dating back to his days as a high-school wrestling coach that he presumably wanted to keep under wraps by paying hush money .	judges are also generally more likely to give lighter sentences to defendants who accept responsibility for their actions and spare the government the cost of a trial .	in exchange for the plea , prosecutors were expected to drop a charge stemming from lying to the fbi .	when the judge asked hastert to describe his wrongdoing in his own words , he read his statement , telling the court that he had been withdrawing cash , $ 50,000 at a time .	after banking officials questioned him , he said , he began taking out less than $ 10,000 to avoid reporting requirements .	speaking in a halting voice and losing his place in the text at one point , he described why he lied to officials : " i did n't want them to know how i intended to spend the money . "	hastert did not say why he required so much cash or why he sought to skirt reporting requirements .	as he finished , the judge immediately asked : " did you know that what you were doing was wrong ? "	he responded , " yes , sir . "	sentencing was scheduled for feb. 29 .	since the plea deal offers a wide punishment range , the sentencing hearing could include arguments from prosecutors on why hastert should spend some time behind bars and from the defense about why he should be spared prison .	asked by the judge if the government would call any witnesses at the sentencing , lead prosecutor steven block left open that possibility , saying the prosecution would decide at a later date .	prosecutors could theoretically call to the witness stand the unnamed person hastert was allegedly paying , a prospect that could make public the conduct hastert sought to conceal .	the sentencing range is below what some legal experts had predicted .	they thought prosecutors would press for six months to two years in prison .	when he arrived at the courthouse , hastert moved through a crowd of waiting photographers and tv cameras .	he walked slowly into court , his shoulders slightly stooped , and peered over his glasses at courtroom benches packed with journalists .	the change-of-plea hearing was the longtime gop leader 's first court appearance since his arraignment in june , when he pleaded not guilty in the same courtroom .	a may 28 indictment accused hastert of handing as much as $ 100,000 in cash at a time to someone referred to only as " individual a. " hastert allegedly made 15 withdrawals of $ 50,000 from 2010 to 2012 .	it 's what he did later in 2012 that made his actions criminal .	after learning withdrawals over $ 10,000 are flagged , he began taking out smaller increments , eventually withdrawing $ 952,000 from 2012 to 2014 , according to the indictment .	hastert was speaker longer than any other republican .	after leaving congress in 2007 , he parlayed his connections into a lucrative lobbying career .	that career is almost certainly over .	as a convicted felon , " no congressman will want to meet with him about anything .	his influence and power will be gone , " said dick simpson , a co-author of " corrupt illinois : patronage , cronyism , and criminality . "
the state public service commission has rejected a staff recommendation for florida power & light co. to set aside $ 400 million for possible refunds due to excess profits .	the commission voted unanimously against the proposal tuesday after a state consumer advocate joined the utility in opposing the set-aside .	the recommendation originally came before the panel in october .	it was postponed then because fpl tried to get former commissioner nathan skop excluded from the case , alleging he was biased .	that became a moot issue when skop 's term expired jan. 1 .	he has been replaced by tampa lawyer julie brown .	company officials say their high earnings were temporary due to weather extremes that increased demand last year .
not even a year after her death , a beloved writer from this small southwest arkansas town has been honored with her own u.s. postal service stamp .	this stamp will be good forever , too , just as her writing is likely to endure for generation after countless generation because of its startling honesty and emotional power .	the roots of this author 's love for writing rest right here in stamps .	it 's where she literally found her voice again after experiencing deep trauma in her life and where she discovered writers like shakespeare , the texarkana gazette ( http://bit.ly/1nmehzg ) reports .	maya angelou , influential and groundbreaking author of the autobiographical " i know why the caged bird sings " and other books of poetry and autobiography , was celebrated in stamps and washington , d.c. , with the unveiling last week of the maya angelou forever stamp .	a hyper-realistic image of angelou 's face and her warm , knowing smile adorn this stamp , along with the quote : " a bird does n't sing because it has an answer , it sings because it has a song . "	the image is from ross rossin 's angelou oil portrait that hangs in the smithsonian national portrait gallery collection . "	i always wanted to paint maya as she was a voice that inspired millions_not just as an individual , but as a legendary poet and a civil rights icon who transcended generations , " rossin said in a statement about his portrait of angelou . "	i was compelled by the challenge to portray her forgiving smile and her aura of unconditional love and understanding that comes across when having a conversation with her . "	postmaster general megan brennan , oprah winfrey , poet nikki giovanni , former ambassador and politician andrew young and angelou 's grandson , colin johnson , had been expected to attend the washington , d.c. , dedication ceremony tuesday .	here in arkansas , people like janis f. kearney of the celebrate maya project and david bright , stamps mayor , welcome the news that a daughter of stamps will be honored his way .	the stamp should be ready for delivery soon , in fact .	kearney , who , along with bright , organized a celebration of angelou this past fall , says she 's proud of this recognition for angelou , a woman from stamps getting her stamp . "	i think it means kind of what we were saying before , that she is an icon for many things , not just literary , " kearney said .	angelou was commitment to peace and empowerment for all people .	the recognition indicates angelou 's popularity across the nation and worldwide .	mayor bright actually worked for many years as a rural carrier for the u.s. postal service and sold commemorative stamps , so he knows what a big honor this is .	typically , he says , a person is deceased for a longer period of time before this happens . "	people are just really proud that somebody who spent her childhood here is going to get a forever stamp , " bright said .	in stamps , the honor was celebrated wednesday at lafayette county high school starting at 10 a.m. in an event organized by the local post office .	angelou 's poetry will be recited , along with the poetry written by a young woman who won a poetry contest at the celebrating maya angelou event held in october .	to bright , angelou 's legacy and stamps go together , making this honor good exposure for the town . "	any conversation about maya angelou will include two words : stamps , ark. , " the mayor said .	and any conversation about stamps will include two words : maya angelou .	the park at lake june was dedicated to angelou last year , and the mayor said the city will apply for a grant to perform improvements at the park .	he hopes to generate interest in the school young angelou ( then known as marguerite johnson ) attended .	that lafayette county training school still stands , though in disrepair .	it was a rosenwald school , the mayor points out .	it 's also on the national register of historic places .	in this part of stamps , there 's that school , the pond she visited and the neighborhood where angelou lived with her grandmother and uncle , all still there to serve as a living link to angelou .	bright sees this area as a potential way to celebrate the stamps connection to angelou , similarly to how the johnny cash boyhood home , an arkansas state university heritage site , honors cash . "	what i would like to do is improve the park and get funding to improve that school , " the mayor said .	in that way , stamps could be a point of interest for people interested in angelou , writing and culture .	the stamp will help him shine a light on what he 'd like to see happen , he believes .	with angelou known internationally , she has a special story , " the story that people can come from humble beginnings and do great things if you just put your mind to it , " he said .	and people are beginning to take pride in her legacy being tied to stamps , he says .	kearney says perceptions have changed about angelou 's connection to stamps .	she believes the celebration event last year made a difference . "	i think awareness has increased a great deal , " kearney said , noting people have told her they knew angelou but their perceptions have shifted about what she 's meant in arkansas .	angelou , after all , discussed the racism she encountered in stamps in such works as " i know why the caged bird sings . "	it was n't flattering .	but it 's also the place where her love for literature sparked .	it 's where a teacher , mrs. flowers , introduced her to shakespeare .	it 's where she received love from her family .	kearney says while nobody wants their town portrayed negatively , writers tell the truth , something we must face . "	i definitely think the awareness and appreciation for her has increased in this state , " said kearney , a writer herself , noting there are stories about young maya going to that lake june pond to sit down and write . "	it was the beginning for her , " kearney said about what kindled angelou 's awakening as a writer .	and she says angelou talked about arkansas in positive ways even if some was negative .	she believes writing about it was , to angelou , cathartic to some extent . "	that 's how she got it out of her system , by writing it in a book , " kearney said .	the angelou legacy includes a sensitivity to what was happening in arkansas and the south , kearney said , explaining that angelou and her writing played an important role in the civil rights struggle .	blacks appreciated the truth-telling she had in her work . "	i think the timing of her memoir was very important because that it was right around the time of the civil rights struggle , " kearney said .	whatever happens negatively in childhood can be turned around and become a positive later , she said .	angelou is another example of a strong woman from arkansas .	march was national women 's history month . "	i just think people should think about the fact that arkansas has been the foundation for some amazing women , " kearney said .

a spanish court has ordered a german pharmaceutical company to pay compensation to 22 spaniards born with disabilities after their mothers used the drug thalidomide during pregnancy decades ago .	madrid 's provincial court tuesday ordered the gruenenthal group in spain to pay 20,000 euros ( $ 26,300 ) for each percentage point of disability of victims recognized by spain 's health ministry .	the total compensation bill was not immediately made known but it was much lower than the 204 million euros sought by the spanish association of thalidomide victims , which brought the case for some 200 alleged victims .	thalidomide was a sedative prescribed between 1950 and 1960 for morning sickness .	thousands of babies whose mothers used it were born worldwide with abnormally short limbs and in some cases without arms , legs or hips .
an oregon man who killed himself last week in an explosion along a busy highway below mount hood had a recent mental health crisis that sent him to a southwest washington hospital , authorities said .	the revelation surprised the family of jeffrey r. williams and shed light on the determination that he committed suicide , the oregonian ( http://is.gd/mzeqm2 ) reported .	on feb. 16 , the 24-year-old portland man called 911 from a beacon rock state park on the washington side of the columbia river , said chief deputy pat bond of the skamania county sheriff 's office .	when deputies arrived , they found williams in the parking lot .	he told them he was considering hanging himself , the deputies reported .	they found a rope tied to a railing .	williams was taken to peacehealth southwest medical center in vancouver .	how long he was there has n't been disclosed .	about a month later , on march 19 along u.s. 26 , investigators found a crater left by an explosion .	the hole was 11 feet wide .	authorities believe the blast was caused by chemicals used to make exploding targets .	the oregon state medical examiner 's office ruled williams ' death a suicide .	williams ' uncle , lt. eric schober of the portland police bureau , said the family had n't known about the skamania report until tuesday and " did not see the signs of someone contemplating suicide . "	in washington , a police officer can place a psychiatric hold on a person for up to 72 hours if there is reasonable cause to believe the person is suffering from a mental disorder and there is a high likelihood the person faces imminent serious harm .	the person 's family can not be notified without the patient 's consent , peacehealth spokesman randy querin said .	schober said williams had studied computer science at a community college , was between tech support jobs and had broken up with a girlfriend several months ago ?	although that did n't seem to trouble him .

standing in front of students at o.c. johnson elementary school in his " no bully zone " t-shirt , professional mixed martial arts fighter carlos " the yuma prodigy " flores spoke about how he used to dread riding the bus as a kid because it was there that he was continually bullied to join a gang .	he remembers one day in particular when a student punched him so hard that he fractured his jaw . "	when i was a kid growing up and having that problem , being bullied , it was bad .	but you know what i did ?	i made sure i told somebody what was going on ... " if you do n't tell somebody , then you ca n't be helped .	it 's very important ?	you have teachers here , you have friends , grandma , dad , mom ?	find an adult you respect . "	during the discussion , students asked flores questions like " why do bullies exist ? "	and " what if you get bullied and then you become a bully ? "	and " what if you 're being bullied and there 's no one around ? "	flores , along with other local athletes , have been speaking to students in the yuma area as part of his recently created " battered and bullied no more " anti-bullying campaign .	he explained that after being a part of mma fighting for the past 10 years , he feels he 's in a place in his life where he wants to also give back and help others . "	i started ' bullied and battered no more ' and started going to different places to talk about bullying because it has gotten so bad , i just decided that i wanted to make a difference . "	professional baja bike racer alonzo dominguez with pirru?as racing , who also spoke at the assembly , said he wanted to jump on the opportunity to present with flores to help positively impact students , as he too was bullied as a kid . "	kids look up to me and my racing team , and i want to reach out to them , " dominguez said .	justified , a local clothing line owned by kevin and dundee dempsey , is also supporting flores in his campaign .	dundee said that when meeting with kids who think they ca n't do something and have been told that by others their whole lives , when they meet people like flores and dominguez , they become inspired . "	our goal is to get out the message that kids should do whatever they love to do and put in that extra effort to realize that dream ... it 's so important for our kids right now to have good role models . "	she added that for most , it takes about three days to kick a bad habit .	if students choose to stop bullying today , by this weekend it can potentially be something of their past .	third-grade teacher alaina sanders said she invited flores to come speak at their campus after finding out about his campaign on facebook . "	i saw that and i thought , ' you know what ?	we , as well as all other schools , all of us need any education we can get on no bullying . "	sanders said that before the assembly , she had her students participate in a classroom exercise .	each was given a new sheet of paper , fresh out of the package , and told to beat it up , crumple it and stomp on it .	she then showed them another sheet of clean paper and told them to try and get their paper to look like hers , and they quickly realized that it was impossible to do . "	i explained to them then that those wrinkles and the dirty marks from their shoes and everything are like the scars that you leave behind on other students that you bully .	scars will never go away ... even myself as an adult being bullied as a child , i still remember who bullied me , what they did , what they looked like , how horrible it made me feel . "	there was a point of time where i bullied other kids ... it never made me feel good to be a bully , and i did it maybe once or twice and then i never did it again because it made me feel horrible .	i knew in my mind it was n't ok that i did n't feel good about it and i did n't do it anymore .

president barack obama and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu are meeting at a time that the three-decade estrangement between the united states and iran may be nearing an end .	obama and netanyahu are set to meet monday , and the white house said the two leaders would discuss negotiations with the palestinians , developments in syria and iran .	the topic of iran was likely to be one of the most contentious . "	i will tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk and the onslaught of smiles , " netanyahu said before boarding his flight from israel to the united states on sunday . "	telling the truth today is vital for the security and peace of the world and , of course , it is vital for the security of the state of israel . "	obama spoke friday with iranian president hassan rouhani in the first direct conversation between the two countries ' leaders since they broke off diplomatic relations after mobs in tehran stormed the u.s. embassy in 1979 and held a total of 52 hostages for 444 days .	the 15-minute phone call was a watershed diplomatic moment and that suggested rouhani ?	with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's permission ?	was interested in re-engaging with the west .	but it also irritated israel , a u.s. ally that has declared an iranian nuclear program unacceptable and a threat to the region .	israelis derisively called iran 's efforts the " smiley campaign " and tried to persuade the united states not to be swayed by iran 's courtship , however persuasive . "	negotiations are on the table to discuss various aspects of iran 's enrichment program , " iranian foreign minister javad zarif said sunday in an english-language interview with abc 's " this week . "	it 's a tempting offer for the united states , but one that could strain the already rocky relationship between obama and netanyahu over construction of new housing settlements , negotiations with palestinians and even their personal feelings about each other that have occasionally spilled into public view .	the united states vowed to consult israeli officials as it weighs a shift on iran , and the two certainly would share intelligence , as they have done for years .	the u.s. ambassador to israel , dan shapiro , moved to calm concerns in an interview monday with israel radio . "	i think there is nothing to worry about our mutual approach to the iranian issue .	we have the same main objectives , " shapiro said , speaking in hebrew . "	our leaders agree on those objectives .	the main objective is to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . "	it 's likely netanyahu will press obama not to be too trusting of iran , whose new president delivered a conciliatory speech at the united nations and declared his readiness for new negotiations with the west .	rouhani also said his country was not seeking ?	nor could it produce ?	a nuclear weapon .	that does not square with israel 's position .	netanyahu was expected to bring intelligence with him to washington that iran was on the cusp of achieving the ability to produce a nuclear weapon .	he has previously argued for action to block iran from acquiring the tools to reach that threshold .	zarif , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , scoffed and said israeli leaders have been warning that tehran is months away from having a nuclear weapon since 1991 , and those fears have never been realized . "	we 're not six months , six years , 60 years away from nuclear weapons .	we do n't want nuclear weapons .	we believe nuclear weapons are detrimental to our security , " he said .	iran has offered to open its nuclear facilities to international inspectors as part of broad negotiations with the united states but has insisted its nuclear program is its right and is for peaceful purposes only .	eytan gilboa , an expert on u.s.-israel relations at israel 's bar-ilan university , predicted a " very difficult conversation " between obama and netanyahu on monday .	the americans " like rouhani , " gilboa said . "	they think he represents a new policy , a new approach and therefore should be given at least a chance . "	the israeli prime minister is not convinced , gilboa said . "	netanyahu 's strategy is to say that this whole thing is a big hoax . "
donald williams , 35 , was arrested thursday afternoon after a two-hour standoff at a new orleans house , u.s. marshal kevin harrison told local media .	marshals , new orleans police , k-9 units and a swat team responded to the house during the standoff .	williams was wanted for questioning in connection with a shooting that occurred thursday at a baton rouge holiday inn .	the victim , a 31-year-old woman , was being treated at a hospital for life-threatening injuries .	as of thursday , she was in serious but stable condition , baton rouge police spokesman cpl. l'jean mckneely said .	detectives are still trying to piece together what happened at the hotel and are waiting to interview the unidentified victim .	dozens of neighbors watched thursday afternoon as authorities surrounded the weathered brick two-story structure in new orleans east where williams had holed up .	more than two hours after the standoff started , williams walked out of the building with his hands up and was quickly surrounded by a circle of law enforcement agents holding body-length shields .

florida saw a massive influx of central and south americans in the last decade , adding complexity to a state that is already home to one of the nation 's most diverse hispanic populations , according to census figures released thursday .	cubans remain the largest single hispanic group in florida , but their share of the state 's latino population dropped slightly over the last decade to just under a third .	meanwhile , the number of central and south americans increased by more than a half-million residents .	south florida was their top destination , with broward , miami-dade and palm beach together gaining more than half of these new arrivals . "	a lot of this story is the continuing unrest of colombia and venezuela , the sandinistas coming back into power in nicaragua , and the sort of general idea that florida is becoming an increasingly attractive place to live , " said florida international university political science professor dario moreno .	more than 70,000 central and south americans also made their home in metro orlando , and another 30,000 chose the tampa area .	brenda bolivar is among those who moved to florida for political reasons .	bolivar , a 28-year-old interior decorator in miami , left venezuela in 2001 with her entire family because of the rise of leftist leader hugo chavez .	her mother already was a u.s. resident , and bolivar had visited her grandparents in florida for years , so the transition was easy . "	my family was worried about the situation in the country , and we all left , " bolivar said . "	it felt like moving home in a way ... .	i was happy , and 10 year later i still love it here . "	others were driven more by the desire to help their families back home .	itzen cabrera , 27 , handles food prep at a restaurant in miami 's chic design district .	he moved from nicaragua five years ago .	the regular remittances he sends to his family back home have allowed his father to open a small bakery and purchase a truck he rents out for construction projects .	those enterprises now employ his three younger brothers .	cabrera , who studied business administration in nicaragua , said he hopes one day to return home and open his own business .	his initial plan was to leave for just five years . "	but each year , this country absorbs you a bit more .	and you say , ' there are so many things left for me to do , so much i wanted to be able to do i have n't done yet . ' "	on the other end of the spectrum is fernando gaston , vice president of programming , production and music strategies for mtv and vh1 latin america .	he moved to miami from buenos aires in 2009 , where he also worked for mtv .	he said : " i see myself as part of the group of latin executives working worldwide , more than as an ' immigrant . ' "	for gaston , miami provided not only excellent work opportunities but also a suburban quality of life . "	it 's an ideal place to raise young children here ?	the quality of life , the outdoors .	it 's family-focused , " he said , though he acknowledges that he occasionally misses the urban , more pedestrian-friendly streets of his hometown .	the census data released thursday also showed that florida 's largest asian population were indians .	the new figures reveal floridians have gotten older in the past decade .	the median age is 40.7 , compared to 38.7 a decade ago .	more unrelated floridians are living together and the percentage of households with married couples declined in the past decade , census data shows .	florida now has the nation 's third-largest latino population at 4.2 million residents ?	almost a quarter of the sunshine state 's population .	and hispanic growth drove florida 's overall population gains , giving the state two more congressional districts on top of its current 25 seats .	the only other states with larger hispanic populations , california and texas , are dominated by latinos of mexican descent .	new york , home to the nation 's fourth-largest latino population , rivals florida for diversity but falls short in numbers .	despite the changes , the cuban-american community continues to dominate the political scene because it remains the most reliable voting bloc , moreno noted .	the cuban-american and puerto rican populations grew in almost equal numbers during the past decade , an outcome that could start shifting hispanic influence from south florida to central florida in coming years .	cubans , who dominate south florida , added about 380,000 new residents .	puerto ricans , central florida 's largest hispanic group , grew by more than 365,000 residents and now make up just over one-fifth of the state 's latinos .	most new puerto ricans settled along the interstate 4 corridor , which stretches from tampa through orlando across to daytona beach .	mexican growth flourished in florida 's rural , agricultural counties , as the state overall added another 265,000 mexicans in the past decade .	mexicans now make up more than a third of the total population in two inland , southwest counties known for farm work , hardee and hendry counties .	tampa 's hillsborough county had the largest influx of mexicans during the decade ?	30,000 new residents .	but moreno pointed out that florida politicians in washington are paying attention to the changing demographics .	florida has the second-largest state delegation on the house foreign affairs committee after california .	and under the leadership of chairwoman ileana ros-lehtinen , r-miami , the colombian free trade agreement has been a priority . "	there 's a real sensitivity to home country issues , " he said . "	in miami , with so many other foreign professionals , you really do n't feel like ' the new one . ' "

a judge on monday rejected requests to seal the entire file and close the courtroom to the public in the case of a teenage girl suing several boys she accuses of group sexual assault and their parents .	new haven superior court judge jonathan silbert ruled that the girl and the seven boys can use pseudonyms , but he said their interests do n't outweigh the public 's interest in open courts .	a copy of the ruling was obtained by the associated press .	silbert noted that the case involves a number of issues of social importance . "	these include parental responsibility for the alleged torts of their children , the legal responsibilities of adults who host parties for children at their homes , and the practice commonly known as ' sexting , ' " he said .	the madison girl and her mother are suing the boys and their parents on allegations she was sexually assaulted when she was 13 by five defendants on new year 's eve 2009 at one boy 's home .	lawyers for some of the boys said the case involved inappropriate touching .	another boy was accused of taking a photo on his cellphone during the incident and showing it to others .	all the teens then attended polson middle school in affluent madison .	lawyers for the girl and some of the boys had asked the judge to seal the case , arguing that it was necessary to protect the minors ' privacy and protect them against social stigmatization because they 're still in school .	the ap objected to the proposed sealing during a hearing before silbert last month .	in his ruling , silbert noted that he found no other case in which the entire file was sealed since 2002 , when a judicial branch practice called " super-sealing " was publicly revealed .	the revelation of super-sealed cases ?	which were so secret that officials would n't even confirm their existence ?	led to judicial officials to abolish the practice and change the sealing rules .	he also ruled that the boys ' parents can not use pseudonyms .	rich hanley , an associate professor of journalism at quinnipiac university , said the judge appeared to be striking a balance ?	like the media does when reporting sexual assault cases ?	between protecting victims and allowing the public to be informed about important social issues through open courts . "	the whole file should n't be sealed because there are clear public policy considerations , based on the whole concept of parental responsibility , " hanley said .	he added , " obviously , the more open a court is , the more transparent it is .	it 's the foundation of america 's court system . "	the girl 's lawyer , matthew auger , who was seeking to seal the file , declined to comment monday on the ruling .	some details of the assault allegations had already been made public in a federal lawsuit the girl and her mother filed against madison school officials in september .	they say school officials , after learning about the assault allegations , failed to discipline the boys , allowed them to remain in school and took no actions to prevent the boys from having contact with the girl while in school .	school officials have denied the allegations .	the boys were criminally charged in juvenile court .	a parent of one of the boys told the ap that all the boys pleaded no contest and were sentenced to probation and community service .	the lawsuit accuses the parents who hosted the party of not properly supervising the gathering and other parents for their responsibility for their children 's conduct .

a group advocating the separation of church and state is protesting a pair of crosses displayed for easter on a tiny eastern ohio village 's municipal building .	the madison , wis.-based freedom from religion foundation has challenged the claim by the mayor of stratton that it 's constitutional to display the crosses during holidays .	mayor john abdalla temporarily removed the crosses in january after the foundation threatened to sue , but he returned them to celebrate the easter season .	one is latin , the other eastern orthodox .	abdalla told the steubenville herald-star that such seasonal displays were allowed .	the mayor declined to comment when contacted wednesday by the associated press , including saying whether the crosses still adorned the building 's facade .	he told the newspaper he planned to remove them at the end of april .	easter is this sunday .	in an april 8 letter , the foundation said religious displays on public buildings represent a violation of the first amendment regardless of what time of year it is . "	while the permanent display of these crosses by the village is indisputably unconstitutional , the seasonal display of the crosses in recognition of easter , the christian celebration of jesus 's resurrection , is no less illegal , " staff attorney rebecca markert wrote . "	the display of these crosses is illegal because it represents government endorsement of the christian religion . "	the foundation said this week that the village has n't replied to its letter , which requested that the village remove the display .	abdalla said he did n't want to discuss the matter nor could he suggest anyone who would . "	no one 's going to talk about this , " he said .	it 's not the first debate over religious freedom in the village .	in 2002 , the u.s. supreme court sided with the watchtower society in a lawsuit challenging a stratton ordinance that imposed registration requirements and penalties on house-to-house solicitation .	justices ruled the law violated the first amendment of jehovah 's witnesses who wished to distribute religious pamphlets door-to-door in the village .
workers filing on-the-job injury claims at just a dozen state institutions clustered in southern illinois collected nearly one-third of the total $ 127 million awarded in recent years for permanent impairment under illinois ' troubled workers ' compensation system , the associated press has found .	leading the pack was menard correctional center in chester , according to an ap analysis of state records .	employees at the prison , now a focus of three fraud investigations into the injury-claim process , collected $ 19 million in long-term benefits from 2007 through 2010 .	that 's nearly twice the amount previously reported .	but beyond menard , the ap study found a pattern of large payouts at 11 other state facilities within 80 miles ?	including prisons and juvenile detention centers , mental health and developmental centers .	in all , the dozen state facilities accounted for $ 40.7 million of the compensation for injured workers ' long-term impairment during those four years .	the ap 's line-by-line review provides the first comprehensive account of the extent of payouts at government facilities , though not private business , under the workers ' comp system before lawmakers revamped it this year .	the examination focused on about 7,800 cases obtained from the illinois workers ' compensation commission through the freedom of information act .	the ap analyzed paid claims statewide after linking nearly all the employees with cases to one of hundreds of government divisions , including worksites such as prisons .	compared to the $ 40.7 million paid on 861 claims at the 12 southern work sites , taxpayers put out $ 24 million on 963 claims at 51 similar facilities elsewhere in illinois .	hundreds of cases were still pending at the end of the period the data covers .	the ap study also found discrepancies between the total claims and awards granted in specific facilities ?	for instance , more at a newer prison in pinckneyville than at the 85-year-old stateville correctional center with double the payroll .	why such a high percentage of awards in one area ?	the answer could involve an employee culture that encouraged injury claims at the facilities in the vicinity , the awards decisions of several state-employed arbitrators now under scrutiny by federal investigators , and a strapped illinois government that some say did not strenuously contest the claims .	a torrent of benefits awarded to menard employees ?	many for repetitive stress like the nerve disorder carpal tunnel syndrome ?	was first reported nearly a year ago by the belleville news-democrat , fueling legislative reforms last spring and gaining the attention of federal prosecutors and state regulators .	the arbitrators deciding injury compensation were instrumental .	nine in 10 of the claims receiving long-term benefits at the southern illinois facilities were assigned to just three arbitrators , who oversaw payment of $ 34 million .	one of them , john dibble , was responsible for $ 28 million himself , including $ 14.8 million at menard , the ap 's analysis showed .	the three arbitrators were named in subpoenas by two u.s. attorneys seeking e-mail and other computer information .	none was reappointed when gov. pat quinn named new arbitrators this fall in response to the legislative overhaul of the system .	dibble could not be reached for comment .	but one of the other two ex-arbitrators mentioned in the subpoenas said the state made little effort to fight claims by workers who came with medical evidence and good lawyers . "	we 're supposed to hear the facts , decide the facts , and apply the facts based on the law , " said former arbitrator andrew nalefski of glen carbon , " and when there 's no contrary evidence , how do you deny the claim ? "	nalefski said he has spoken to investigators who have told him he 's not a target of the probe .	between 2007 and 2010 , he was responsible for $ 6.9 million in permanent impairment awards .	anne spillane , chief of staff for the illinois attorney general , countered that the state " never gave up defending as vigorously as possible " compensation cases .	but southern illinois arbitrators often paid higher awards for repetitive stress than others elsewhere in the state and some decided claims based on past cases rather than listening to state evidence , she said .	and illinois has very low criteria for proving what is known as " causation , " or how job duties contributed to the injury , she said .	the reform law allowed quinn to name new arbitrators and put a cap on awards for repetitive stress injuries , but did n't address the causation bar .	edward fisher , a chester attorney who handled many of the southern illinois cases , suggested awareness of the law among workers in the area also contributed to the volume of claims and awards .	claims beget claims ?	the more filed , the more people encourage injured co-workers to pursue their benefits , fisher said , calling it " the psychology of the group . "	the ap contacted a dozen injured state employees but none would talk publicly .	one worker at pinckneyville prison who had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome said even with automation , guards still turn keys in individual locks 50 to 100 times a day .	he said on the recommendation of another state employee , he sought out a fairview attorney to help him with part of his case .	he spoke on condition of anonymity because of the negative publicity surrounding the issue .	the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , the union representing most of the employees , defended legitimate compensation for injuries at work in prisons and mental health hospitals . "	that work is difficult , it is physically intensive , and it can be dangerous , and people get hurt , " spokesman anders lindall said awards at the southern illinois worksites ?	in anna , centralia , chester , harrisburg , ina , murphysboro , pinckneyville , tamms , and vienna ?	were high despite their varying functions and ages .	for example , workers at menard blamed repetitive stress injuries on operating the 130-year-old prison 's hand-crank locks .	but payments ?	many for the same type of injury ?	at the more modern pinckneyville prison , just 35 miles from chester , ranked second-highest in the state despite a more up-to-date electronic locking system .	pinckneyville employees received $ 4.6 million for permanent-injury claims , compared to only $ 1.6 million at stateville correctional center in joliet , which opened in 1925 and has twice as many employees .	in another instance , workers at the chester mental health center , with a staff of 460 and just a few miles from menard , received $ 3.9 million in awards .	by contrast , elgin mental health center in the chicago suburbs , with 660 workers , received only $ 430,000 in awards .	workers at chester had seven times as many awards for injuries resulting from " altercation " or " assault " ?	attributable , officials say , to a population of sometimes violent , criminally committed residents .	but chester had 200 other cases of injury , compared to an overall total of 53 at elgin .
a wake county jury has found a raleigh man guilty of first-degree murder for murdering and dismembering the mother of two of his children .	the jury of four men and eight women deliberated for less than two hours monday before returning their verdict in the trial of 34-year-old grant hayes .	superior court judge donald stephens sentenced hayes to life in prison without the possibility of parole .	attorneys for hayes said they would appeal .	nearly 50 witnesses testified that hayes lured laura jean ackerson to his raleigh apartment , killed her and disposed of her dismembered body in a texas creek .	the two had been involved in a custody dispute .	defense attorneys said hayes ' current wife killed ackerson , and he is only guilty of trying to help her cover it up .
police scrambled back when the door swung open at an everett man 's home nov. 8 , 2008 , and they found themselves staring at the barrel of a shotgun .	the everett officers were summoned to dustin willard 's home by a 911 call reporting a possible burglary in progress .	they took up positions around the house and rang the doorbell .	what followed was sudden violence in the dark , according to more than 800 pages of reports from the official investigation of the shooting , released thursday to the herald under state public records laws .	willard was carrying a loaded 12-gauge shotgun .	when he did n't immediately heed commands to drop the weapon , and pointed it at the uniformed officers , three of them opened fire , according to the police reports .	a total of 17 shots were fired .	willard was hit four times .	he died just inside the door of his home .	willard , 31 , had been out enjoying a night of drinking with friends .	he apparently was locked out of his house , and had kicked the front door and then stumbled loudly through his back yard before forcing his way through the back door .	neighbors mistook the noise willard made as sounds made by a burglar and they summoned police .	the fatal shooting was investigated by a special team of homicide detectives with the snohomish county multiple agency response team .	their progress was slowed by turnaround times at the state crime lab .	tests on dna samples took 10 months .	ballistics testing took nearly a year .	snohomish county prosecutor mark roe has yet to indicate whether he believes the police killing was legally justified .	the willard family in october filed a claim for damages with the city of everett for up to $ 20 million .	they 've been in anguish , waiting for detectives to finish their investigation , said their attorney , angelo calfo of seattle . "	it 's not as simple as dustin pointed a gun at officers and they feared for their lives , " calfo said thursday . "	it 's more complicated than that . "	police rushed to the home in the 2400 block of 23rd street about 1:45 a.m. after neighbors called 911 .	when officers arrived they spotted a muddy shoe print on the front door ?	evidence they believed that somebody had tried to kick their way inside .	lights were on in the home and a tv could be heard .	officers told investigators they followed procedure and quietly surrounded the house .	then an officer said he rang the doorbell , twice .	willard opened the door , leveling a shotgun , reports said .	positioned behind a utility pole , everett police officer sunny radosevich said she began yelling " gun ! "	when she saw the shotgun 's barrel nose out of the front door .	officers stephen harney and aaron showalter were feet from willard , near the porch .	they told detectives how they scrambled back while bringing up their handguns and aiming at the man with the shotgun . "	i yell , police ... .	drop the gun , ' " harney was quoted in transcript of his interview with detectives .	his voice was described as shaky as he recounted the shock of realizing that a real weapon ?	not a toy ?	was aimed his direction . "	the only thought in my mind is this guy 's gon na kill me with a gun .	i did n't think that he was a homeowner or a burglar .	it 's a guy with a gun , " he told detectives .	showalter described being transfixed by the shotgun 's barrel as it preceded willard through the open door .	he told detectives he started to fire as he was backing away , heard gunshots and saw harney fall .	he did n't know the other officer had tripped . "	at that moment i believed my partner had been shot and uh , i was in fear for my life , " showalter was quoted in the police transcript .	radosevich said she and the other officers were yelling at willard to put down the weapon , but she opened fire after he appeared to move the shotgun into position to shoot police . "	i think he would have killed the officers that were standing in front of the house , " she told detectives . "	he coulda killed me . "	the officers and everett fire department paramedics unsuccessfully tried to revive willard .	each of the officers was questioned by investigators after they reviewed their statements with an attorney , the detectives ' report said .	it will be up to roe , the prosecutor , to determine if charges are warranted .	last year roe charged everett police officer troy meade with first-degree manslaughter for the june 10 killing of niles meservey behind the chuckwagon inn .	the shooting happened as meade was trying to get the drunken man out of his car .	meservey 's family also filed a claim against the city .	they 're demanding up to $ 15 million .	willard 's death has been difficult for his family .	they remembered him as an upstanding man and have struggled during the yearlong investigation , said calfo , their attorney . "	mr. willard came to the door when the officers knocked .	not knowing their identity , he carried a shotgun for protection , " willard 's relatives said in their claim for damages . "	under the circumstances , the officers ' actions were , among other things , negligent , reckless and outrageous . "

( at ) check brightcove for video accompanying this story .	( at ) by ellen creager detroit free press it 's not the engines that make the airplane fly .	it 's james steinhagen 's finger circles . "	as the plane begins the takeoff roll , i whirl my finger around in a small circle faster and faster as the plane accelerates down the runway , " the 62-year-old said . "	my thinking is that this will help keep the engines running as we prepare to climb into the air .	fortunately , i have not had a situation where this did n't work -- at least not yet . "	it may sound crazy .	it may sound strange .	but steinhagen of troy , mich. , is definitely not alone in his flying superstitions . "	my wife and i have this superstition that we always lift our feet while the plane is accelerating down the runway until it leaves the ground .	this helps the plane into the air , " said carl steinecker , 64 , of south lyon , mich. . "	i lift up on the armrest to get the plane into the air , " said dr. thomas harding , 53 , a milwaukee psychiatrist .	flying superstitions help otherwise-sensible travelers gain an illusion of control when they are in a tin can suspended in the sky , experts say . "	since people look into the air and see nothing holding the plane up , it all seems like magic anyway , right ?	so if you lift up on the armrest , it might help the plane rise , " said tom bunn , a psychologist and pilot who runs the soar program to conquer fear of flying . "	in addition , there is an anthropomorphism going on -- the plane is not just a mechanical object , but it has feelings .	you think the plane is trying and struggling , and you need to help it , so there is the spinning of the finger to help the engine turn .	there 's the lifting of the feet off the floor , which is really kind of cute . "	flying superstitions are not the same as the fear of flying .	people are willing to fly .	they just have rituals and charms to make sure everything goes well . "	when my son matt was 6 years old , he started patting the exterior of the airplane as we entered it .	it always reminded me of patting the head of your dog to be a good boy , " said gail cotter , 59 , of howell , mich. " he made sure we all patted the airplane before we stepped into the plane .	we have done that for the past 22 years . "	rituals , charms , chants ( at ) linda emerson , 61 , of farmington hills , mich. , must buy a crossword puzzle book at the airport before her flight .	she also must be holding the in-flight travel magazine during takeoff . "	i actually sort of panic if there is n't one in my seat pocket , " she said .	one woman has been repeating the same superstitious phrase on her flights for 24 years . "	in 1987 , a northwest airliner crashed at detroit metro , killing all aboard except for one child , " said linda ogden , 60 , of macomb township , mich. " the cause of the crash was determined to be the flaps and slats not being extended during takeoff .	as a result , my silent mantra , as the plane is lumbering down the runway , is ' flaps and slats , flaps and slats , flaps and slats . ' "	ogden 's superstition has an odd logic , bunn said . "	it 's like by saying ' flaps and slats ' she can get the message to the pilot , " he said . "	it 's like a superstition that overlaps with self-calming . "	as a psychiatrist , harding often works with those afraid to fly or who have other phobias .	his own lifting up on the armrests is about " being in control , " he said .	bunn , a former commercial pilot , said pilots use self-calming methods , such as thinking of a favorite song or doing the same preparation every time .	self-calming affects people 's own moods .	but superstitious acts are aimed at the plane and its fate .	years ago , michael konesko , 57 , of saginaw , mich. , started listening to bonnie raitt music on a sony walkman cassette while in the air .	he now has an ipod , but his superstition still requires him to listen to raitt . "	i listen to bonnie as the first group of music , even before moving to other artists or even watching a movie , " he said . "	i have never been on a plane that crashed while listening to her , so why risk it ? "	skipping a good-bye ( at ) then , there are the superstitions to ward off the possibility you might not come back . "	i have specific good-byes for my kids , but not my wife .	i say nothing to her , " said jeff flowers , 37 , of oak park , mich. " every tragedy , you see someone saying , ' the last thing he said to me was how much he loved me . '	if i do n't say that , nothing will happen . "	jacqueline carr , 58 , also of anchorage , alaska , wears the exact same clothes on every leg of a flight , even on the return .	bunn said people need to believe that constant preparation for disaster can ward it off .	esther rosner of bloomfield hills , mich. , 52 , always steps onto the plane with her right foot first .	she and her husband hold hands on takeoff until the seat-belt sign turns off .	but before they even leave for the airport , they do one more superstitious thing .

the plan to rescue greece from bankruptcy has kicked in , and with a vengeance .	as the government slashes spending and hikes taxes , the deficit is way down ?	but jobs are vanishing , shops are closing , and on the streets gloom is prevailing .	the european union likes the swift action on the deficit .	but few greeks are in a mood to celebrate .	many predict a fall of strikes and demonstrations as those who could afford a summer holiday return to a grim reality .	on paper , the turnaround is working .	the finance ministry said friday the budget deficit has narrowed by a whopping 39.7 percent on the year , slightly better than the original target .	the european union , which demanded the cuts in return for bailout loans , is positively purring .	on thursday , the eu said greece 's efforts to slash spending were " impressive . "	less impressed are shop owners , who say consumers have tightened their purse strings , cutting down on the nonessentials .	higher taxes and cuts in government jobs and salaries are removing the stimulus effect of government spending from the economy . "	civil servants used to come in and buy a double espresso and something to eat .	now they get a single espresso , and a cheaper sandwich , " said constantinos garyfallou , who spends about 15 hours a day running a coffee shop just off athens ' central syntagma square and near several ministries and state-run services .	even small changes in consumer spending ?	50 cents less per customer each day ?	could translate to a fall in revenue for his coffee shop of about ?	4,000 ( $ 5,000 ) a month . "	nobody can withstand a fall like that , " garyfallou said .	struggling under a mountain of debt , greece was forced this year to ask for rescue loans from the international monetary fund and other european union countries that use the euro as their currency in order to avoid defaulting on its loans .	in return , the center-left government is having to implement a strict austerity program that has seen it cut the pay of greece 's more than 700,000 civil servants , trim pensions , hike taxes and overhaul pension and employment rules .	the main target is to slash the budget deficit to 8.1 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the year , from the current 13.6 percent ?	more than four times the limit for eurozone countries .	the first batch of loans under the three year , ?	110 billion package arrived in may , a day before athens faced default when it had to reservice maturing bond debt .	the eu has recommended approval of a second batch in september .	by then , there will probably be more shuttered shopfronts on the main streets of athens .	in addition to the drop in turnover , banks are increasingly reluctant to hand out loans .	for many businesses , the combined pinch has just been too much . "	have you seen all the ' for rent ' signs in the center ?	i 've never seen anything like it in the past 30 years , " said georgia brezati , owner of a clothes shop just off the popular pedestrian shopping street of ermou in central athens , where a report this month by the national confederation of hellenic commerce , or esee , said 15 percent of shops had shut down .	a recent survey by the athens chamber of commerce and industry revealed that 86 percent of the 523 businesses questioned said they were suffering cash flow problems , while a staggering 93 percent had suffered a fall in turnover due to the financial crisis .	the chamber 's head , constantinos mihalos , criticized the government for implementing policies " restricted only to serving the interests of our lenders , ignoring the serious problems of the market and of society in general . "	some economists think the emphasis on austerity could be misplaced , and in the end could make repaying greece 's debts harder by choking off growth .	businesses in the center of athens have also suffered from the frequent strikes and sometimes-violent demonstrations last spring , when angry greeks took to the streets to protest the austerity program , blocking traffic from the city center for hours .	shop owners often have to close and board up their windows to protect them from youths hurling rocks and molotov cocktails , and customers stay away .	last may , three people died trapped in a burning bank torched by protesters on stadiou street , along a demonstration route .	it is that street ?	one of the capital 's main thoroughfares ?	that has been the worst hit by store closures , with about 25 percent rolling down their shutters and moving out , according to esee figures .	brezati , who could n't afford to go on a summer vacation for the first time in years , said she kept her store open all summer but was barely seeing a couple of customers a day .	her business would survive , she explained , because she owned the store , but many around her who were renting just could n't make ends meet and have thrown in the towel .	panagis karelas , head of the of athens traders association , expects closures to continue . "	there is a climate of insecurity which has hit turnover and means that greek business owners , big or small , will not dare to invest in the future .	so more businesses are closing and more people are losing their jobs , " he said .	unemployment hit 12 percent in may , slightly up from 11.9 percent the previous month , while the country 's gdp fell by 1.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010 , compared to the first three months of the year .	and the fall is set to be tough , with the government planning to loosen state control of power generation , privatize loss-making state enterprises and liberalize tightly regulated professions that are sapping productivity .	unions have promised more strikes and demonstrations .	which will only increase the pain .	associated press writer derek gatopoulos contributed to this report .

many idaho homeowners will be getting a smaller tax break on their primary residences come 2011 , but it does n't necessarily mean their property tax bills will go up .	due to the moribund housing market and falling values , the maximum homeowner 's exemption next year will decrease to $ 92,040 , from $ 101,153 this year .	the idaho state tax commission 's alan dornfest said tuesday , " the decrease reflects the recent state of the housing market .

syrian government forces and kurdish fighters clashed in the northeastern city of hassakeh , killing and wounding several people saturday after days of tension between the two sides , an activist group and kurdish officials said .	it has been rare for the two sides to clash since the government withdrew much of its forces from kurdish areas in 2012 to support positions elsewhere in the country .	since then members of the kurdish militia known as the people 's protection units , or ypg , have openly deployed in these areas .	the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights said the clashes broke out after ypg members detained 10 syrian soldiers and pro-government gunmen after they deployed in areas controlled by the kurds .	it said that by the afternoon ypg fighters were in control of a police station , a military-owned gas station and grain silos .	it said ypg fighters killed four soldiers and captured 25 while the government forces had captured four kurdish fighters kurdish democratic union party spokesman nawaf khalil said the fighting was concentrated in several different areas in the predominantly kurdish city .

the two nominees vying to lead south carolina 's public schools debated monday night on tax credits for private school tuition , early childhood education and how to improve graduation rates .	democrat frank holleman said it 's time to move past the debate over tax credits to offset the cost of private and home schools , which he called vouchers by a different label , while republican mick zais argued it 's a way to provide students more opportunities . "	we do n't have time to play political games or get into ideological diversions , " holleman said during the live debate on south carolina educational television , two weeks after they debated on etv radio .	it was their last scheduled broadcast debate .	the idea of using tax credits to help offset the cost of private tuition and homeschool supplies has divided gop lawmakers since gov. mark sanford began pushing it after taking office in 2003 .	various versions have died in the republican-controlled legislature . "	it 's all about taking care of kids and providing them maximum opportunities , " zais said .	holleman said the best investment the state could make is in early childhood education .	the 56-year-old greenville attorney helped launch first steps under former gov. jim hodges , and advocates expanding full-day 4-year-old kindergarten to help improve students ' chances of success .	zais , the former president of newberry college , says expanding the program is too expensive , and he doubts the long-term benefits .	some students just are n't ready to learn that young , he said .	he also said he 's concerned about putting private , church and nonprofit preschool programs out of business .	he says the state can improve high school graduation by concentrating on reading in kindergarten through sixth grade .	the legislature created a limited 4-year-old program in 2006 for at-risk students in certain districts in response to a court order in a long-standing education funding lawsuit .	the 63-year-old took the helm of newberry college ?	a private , lutheran-supported school ?	after retiring from the u.s. army in 2000 as a brigadier general .	he is gov. mark sanford 's appointee to the state commission on higher education and the southern region educational board .	holleman was chief of staff and deputy u.s. secretary of education under former gov. dick riley , during the clinton administration .	the job of education superintendent involves lobbying legislators , working with local school officials and directing an agency of about 900 employees ?	half of whom work in maintenance to keep the state 's statewide school bus fleet running .	the official also oversees teacher certification and training , curriculum standards , testing and meal programs .

health care advocates urged the legislature 's budget committee monday not to delay expanding medicaid coverage to poor childless adults for three months as gov. scott walker is proposing , saying doing anything less than that is immoral .	current law expands medicaid coverage in january to about 83,000 childless adults who earn less than the poverty level .	at the same time , about 72,000 people receiving medicaid now who earn more than poverty level would be kicked off the program .	those people would have to purchase insurance through the federally run exchange .	walker , citing the widely acknowledged problems with the online exchange website , last month proposed delaying kicking people out of medicaid until april .	that would give them three additional months to purchase insurance through the federal website healthcare.gov .	to pay for that continuation of coverage , walker also proposed delaying expanding medicaid for the childless adults until april .	the republican-controlled legislature is moving quickly on walker 's plan , with the assembly slated to vote on it wednesday and the senate later this month .	but opponents , including aarp wisconsin and a coalition of religious leaders , told the committee at monday 's hearing that the legislature should delay both kicking people out of medicaid and expanding coverage to the childless adults as required under current law .	republicans who control the committee bristled at the criticism , saying it was the poor rollout of the federal health insurance website that is forcing them to delay the coverage expansion in order to give those who face losing medicaid more time to purchase private insurance .	rep. john nygren , a republican co-chair of the committee , called the rollout of the health exchange website a " disaster , " noting that as of mid-november only 877 people in wisconsin had purchased coverage through it .	it 's disingenuous to place all the blame with the federal government , said bobby peterson , executive director of the health care advocacy group abc for health , a public-interest law firm in madison that helps connect wisconsin families with health care . "	it 's just a ridiculous argument and needs to be called what it is , " peterson said . "	it 's a political excuse . "	walker 's current plan " does n't make moral sense , " peterson said .	it 's " unconscionable " to pay for the medicaid delay by also putting off expanding the program for childless adults below the poverty line , said bonnie margulis , a rabbi and president of wisconsin faith voices for justice .	margulis and others who testified said walker and the legislature were wrong not to take federal money to pay for medicaid coverage for those earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level .	instead , walker lowered medicaid eligibility for parents and caretaker relatives from 200 percent to 100 percent of poverty , reducing the number of people on the program , while expanding medicaid to childless adults below poverty .	the childless adult program has been closed to new enrollees since 2009 .	the federal poverty level is $ 11,490 for an individual , $ 15,510 for a couple and $ 23,550 for a family of four .

rupert murdoch is a political kingmaker in britain and his native australia .	in the united states , he 's best known for promoting conservative opinion through media properties like the fox news channel .	and in china , he 's primarily a businessman working to give his news corp. empire a toehold in that country 's tightly controlled media market .	the phone hacking scandal roiling britain has cast a fresh light on the billionaire media mogul 's influence around the globe .	his outsize political role in britain will almost certainly be reduced amid evidence his newspapers illegally hacked the phones of people ranging from a murdered teenager to celebrities , sports stars and possibly even the grieving families of dead soldiers or terror victims .	it 's less clear what will happen in australia .	murdoch 's political engagement in the u.s. and elsewhere is less intimate and may not be as compromised by the burgeoning phone hacking and police bribery controversy . "	his newspapers in england are far more directly involved in politics than anything he owns in the u.s , " said michael wolff , editorial director of adweek magazine and author of a murdoch biography , " the man who owns the news . " ''	he 's significantly more influential in the political life of that country . "	in the u.s. and other countries , wolff said , " he 's wielded considerable influence but much less than in the u.k. he 's focused his influence mainly on the regulatory issues that most affect his business . "	murdoch has been the most influential outside player in british politics for decades , with leaders of all ideological stripes competing for his backing .	he 's often referred to as the country 's permanent cabinet member .	the hacking scandal has freed british lawmakers , who have long lived in fear of his power .	they issued a summons to murdoch and his son james to appear before a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal ?	a step that would have been unthinkable until recently .	in the u.s. , the fbi has begun a preliminary inquiry based on concerns in congress over a report that news corp. sought to hack into the phones of sept. 11 victims .	murdoch began building his power in britain in the 1980s , when conservative prime minister margaret thatcher allowed murdoch to add the times and the sunday times to his stable of media properties , including the sun and the news of the world , the tabloid primarily connected to the hacking scandal .	murdoch shuttered the news of the world last week .	murdoch returned thatcher 's favor , and his papers strongly backed her conservative policies .	murdoch continued to have relationships with british leaders after thatcher stepped down .	in the 1992 parliamentary elections , when it looked as though labour party leader neil kinnock might topple thatcher 's successor , john major , as prime minister , the sun published a bold front-page headline : " if kinnock wins today will the last person to leave britain please turn out the lights . "	that headline was credited with helping major and the tories to victory .	murdoch eventually switched his allegiance to tony blair , the labour prime minister from 1997-2007 .	blair telephoned murdoch repeatedly before committing british troops to the iraq war in 2003 , which was strongly endorsed by murdoch 's newspapers across the world .	blair 's successor , labour party leader gordon brown , tried initially to resist murdoch 's influence .	but he did attend the wedding of the company 's chief executive , rebekah brooks , who was news of the world editor in 2002 when the paper 's operatives hacked the phone of 13-year-old murder victim milly dowler , giving her family false hope that their daughter was still alive .	dowler 's family has called on brooks to resign .	murdoch visited the current conservative prime minister , david cameron , shortly after he took office in may 2010 ?	the only formal meeting cameron held at downing street that month aside from those with foreign dignitaries .	cameron has distanced himself from murdoch in recent days since cameron 's former communications director andy coulson , a former news of the world editor , was arrested in the hacking probe .	cameron announced wednesday he had placed a judge in charge of reviewing evidence tied to the scandal . "	there is a firestorm , if you like , that is engulfing parts of the media , parts of the police , and indeed our political system 's ability to respond , " he said .	in australia , where murdoch 's journalist father , sir keith arthur murdoch , was well connected in political circles , the younger murdoch has been similarly influential .	he became a prominent political figure in his own right in 1964 , when he founded the newspaper the australian .	today , news corp. controls 70 percent of that country 's news readership and his papers have been the main platform for climate change skeptics there . "	he 's had very close relationships with every prime minister for the last 30 years , " said david mcknight , author of " rupert murdoch : political crusader " and an associate professor of journalism at the university of new south wales . "	i do n't know any country in the world where a single proprietor has such extraordinary penetration and influence . "	murdoch is not as personally connected to political leadership in the u.s. , where he is a naturalized citizen .	but he commands a host of right-leaning media outlets , including fox news channel and the new york post .	he also owns the wall street journal , whose editorial page is an influential conservative voice .	murdoch has been less ideological as a political donor , contributing money primarily to republicans but also to democrats involved in setting policy that might affect news corp. 's bottom line .	he gave $ 6,500 and hosted a fundraiser in 2006 for then-new york sen. hillary rodham clinton , a democrat who had been pilloried by the new york post during her first senate campaign .	news corp. raised eyebrows last year when it was disclosed that the company had contributed $ 1.25 million to the republican governors association and $ 1 million to the u.s. chamber of commerce before the 2010 midterm elections .	in april , the company 's board announced that news corp. would disclose its political giving annually on its website .	news corp. is far from the only media company hoping to influence policy in washington .	others , including comcast , time warner and the walt disney co. , have contributed nearly $ 38 million to candidates in the last two decades , according to the center for responsive politics .	but judd legum , who has researched murdoch as vice president for communications at the liberal center for american politics , says murdoch 's impact on the u.s. political conversation ?	primarily through fox news ?	sets him apart from other media moguls . "	i would n't say it 's as great as it is in britain .	but to have that kind of relationship with all the most influential republican players is pretty unprecedented , " legum said , noting that many gop presidential candidates and potential contenders have been paid fox contributors , including former house speaker newt gingrich ; former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , who sought the republican presidential nomination in 2008 ; and sarah palin , the 2008 gop vice presidential contender and a former governor of alaska .	in italy , murdoch has been very much the aggressive businessman , challenging premier silvio berlusconi 's mediaset broadcast empire .	in may , james murdoch addressed a newspaper convention in tuscany and chided publishers for accepting state subsidies , a long-established practice that papers depend on for their survival .	he told them that nothing comes without a price .	in china , murdoch has spent two decades trying to expand news corp. 's presence but has sharply scaled back after the company 's plans were blocked by government media controls .	murdoch visited china repeatedly over the past 20 years to lobby for market access , and his charm offensive included arranging a private screening of " titanic , " made by his 20th century fox film studio , for then-president jiang zemin in 1998 .	in 2005 , murdoch complained that news corp. had " hit a brick wall " in china .	he said government authorities there were " paranoid " and did n't want foreign investors in their media market .	chinese regulators , in turn , complained that murdoch 's publications sometimes aired racy content that ran afoul of government censors .

discussions are underway to have an air force unit share use of delaware air national guard c-130 cargo planes at a base near new castle .	the ( wilmington ) news journal reports ( http://delonline.us/woiesk ) a similar arrangement already is in place at dover air force base .	officials say the move could help diversify the base 's mission and assure its survival during future base realignments .	the new castle base came close to losing its entire air guard flying mission during the 2005 federal base closure round .	brig. gen. carol timmons , commander of the state air national guard , says his officers are doing everything they can to make it happen .
outside a small southern indiana town , 41 soldiers lay wounded and dying .	military helicopters carrying medical teams swarmed the area , evacuating the victims and picking up and treating the injured .	but the scene was n't a war zone .	it was an intense simulation staged by the army national guard to prepare helicopter-based medical evacuation units for deployment overseas .	and for the last week , similar scenes have turned indiana into an imaginary combat zone for the 2-238th general support aviation battalion medevac unit training at grissom air reserve base .	more than 130 guardsmen flying up to 12 uh-60 black hawk helicopters are using the base as their home station to learn the ins and outs of treating and transporting wounded soldiers before deployment to southwest asia this fall .	for sgt. scott darrall , who served in iraq in 2007 and 2008 , the " mass casualty " war zone scenario was one of the most intense simulations the unit performed . "	it was a pretty stressful event , but we came together well , " he said . "	it actually went pretty smooth . "	but not every training scenario is so fierce .	the unit also conducts eight to 15 daily missions aimed at buffing up skills in areas like flight operations , aircraft maintenance , medical treatment , logistics , communications and ground refueling . "	we try to replicate what the guys are going to see when they go out into the field , " said maj. bryon blohm , commander of the battalion .	he said the medical evacuation unit is like the army 's 911 , providing air ambulances that offer en route care to wounded soldiers .	often , the high-level treatment troops receive in the helicopters is the difference between life and death , he said .	each black hawk houses one medic , one crew chief and two pilots .	the helicopters have enough space for three stable , walking wounded soldiers and two litters for critical patients .	in the rear , a medical suite houses bandages , tourniquets , iv solutions , heart-rate and vital-care monitors and sled-like skids that can be lowered into battle areas if the unit is unable to land .	for darrall , the fact that medics must treat soldiers while buzzing through the air at 160 mph is the defining difference between offering medical assistance on the ground versus tending wounds in a helicopter . "	it 's very much of a challenge , " he said . "	trying to stick an iv into someone who 's moving around inside a cramped space is much different than sticking someone laying on a cot in a hospital . "	the more profound challenge , however , is knowing you 're the only medic available to care for someone whose life may hang in the balance , darrall said . "	on the ground , you have other medics to help you out .	but on the helicopter , you 're it , " he said . "	everybody 's counting on you .	you keep that thought in the back of your head , ' do n't screw up . ' "	blohm said that 's the reason the sometimes grueling training is so critical for the unit - soldiers need to know exactly what to do to ensure efficient and effective care for patients in every situation .	although darrall and the 2-238 battalion have previously served in war zones , he said the simulations are necessary to keep them sharp and slick . "	you always learn something new every day , but a lot it is just knocking out the cobwebs and refreshing your memory .	... but we still train and train and train so we do n't even have to think about it .	it needs to become muscle memory , " he said .	the battalion will remain stationed at grissom and continue missions across indiana until may 3 .	blohm said the facility is a great place to cross train with the air reserve and learn how to cooperate with a different military branch -- a necessary lesson , since they 'll work together during their deployment in asia . "	this is a great opportunity to get out into a new environment , " he said . "	and to have these kinds of facilities and the staff support at grissom has been tremendous . "

at 6:30 or 7:00 each morning , you may just be rolling out of bed or finishing up that first cup of coffee .	but some students at st. cloud technical and community college have already been in their first class of the day .	because of a demand for courses in the health sciences , the school now offers a 6:30 a.m. anatomy course .	it 's part of a nationwide trend .	because of skyrocketing enrollment , community colleges are scheduling classes at unusual times to squeeze more students in .	things move quickly during liz burand 's 6:30 a.m. physiology and anatomy course .	she begins her pre-dawn class with a short quiz , then moves into a brief discussion about the cross-section of cells featured on the test .	after that , burand runs a video showing an up-close , and rather gory , throat surgery .	burand says teaching at a fast pace is vital in a class that begins before the sun rises .	she does n't want her students to get bored , or sleepier than they already are . "	i try to make sure my lectures are 10 minutes or less , and then either a group discussion or getting up , preferably moving around , really integrating as much activity as i can in the classroom , " said burand .	so why would anyone take a course four days a week this early in the morning ? "	some of them are here because they like it at 6:30 in the morning , it 's convenient for them .	others are here because it 's the only thing that was left and they have to , " she said .	the early morning schedule was actually burand 's idea .	last fall , the college needed to add another anatomy and physiology course to meet student demand , and the rest of the day was full .	despite the start time , the class filled right away , and even had a waiting list .	last semester , aimee klein took one of those first 6:30 anatomy classes .	it was the only section left and klein , 27 , needed the course to prepare for her masters degree in occupational therapy .	this semester , klein signed up for the early class by choice .	she enjoys getting one class out of the way first thing in the day .	she also finds that it 's filled with dedicated students . "	the early morning class you have the serious people , the ones that have work and take it more seriously , " said klein .	st. cloud community and technical college saw double-digit percentage growth in enrollment this year .	in part , that 's due to laid-off workers returning to school .	but it 's also because students are flocking to careers in health care , jobs considered stable in a recession .	janet steinkamp , the college 's dean of health sciences and human services , says whatever their reason , students are demanding more early morning classes . "	i would think it is , for some people , a stretch .	it 's very early in the morning , " said steinkamp . "	for some people , it is probably a godsend for their schedule .	so we will continue to try this and maybe expand into some other courses . "	steinkamp says other community colleges in minnesota offer classes that start as early as 7 a.m. , but says st. cloud technical and community college appears to be the only one with classes that start at 6:30 .	the school appears to be part of a growing national trend for community colleges who have long catered to students who need more flexibility , because of jobs or family responsibilities .	faced with rising enrollments , community colleges across the country are packing the day with classes to fit in more students . "	community colleges have gotten pretty creative .	the notion of turning away a student is something they just do n't want to do , " said norma kent , spokeswoman for the american association of community colleges .	kent says colleges are offering more early-bird courses to meet demand .	and now , some colleges are also offering classes well into the night . "	they have what some are calling graveyard classes , where students come in at 11 or 12 o'clock at night , " she said .	st. cloud technical and community college already runs classes until 9:30 at night , but school officials say they would go later if enough students demanded it .	students are n't just looking for flexibility at morning and night .	community college officials in minnesota report that some students are starting to ask that classes be offered on sundays , a day that 's traditionally been off limits .

the video of a fellow student berating food service workers who refused to sell him jalapeno-bacon mac and cheese prompted a group of students to start an online fundraiser to give the beleaguered employees a well-deserved night out . "	a top-20 research university should n't have to be redeeming its name after one bad egg goes and ruins our reputation , " said freshman sadie rumsey .	rumsey and her friends set up a page on gofundme.com ( https://www.gofundme.com/vs5yvngw ) to show their support to the workers abused in the video captured inside the university 's student union last week .	as of sunday , the page had collected more than $ 1,300 .	the 9-minute , obscenity-laced video clip posted online shows freshman luke gatti arguing with and eventually shoving dave robinson , a food service supervisor .	police and the manager said gatti had been refused service last sunday night for carrying an open alcohol container .	the video , which became fodder for late-night talk show hosts , shows the 19-year-old questioning why in america he ca n't have beer in the building .	he uses a gay slur against robinson and repeatedly demands , " just give me some ( expletive ) bacon-jalapeno mac and cheese . "	after shoving robinson , gatti is tackled by another employee , is arrested by a police officer and spits at the manager before being led out of the building .	gatti , of bayville , new york , has not returned phone calls or an email seeking comment .	he is due in court tuesday on charges of breach of peace and criminal trespass .	rumsey , 19 , of exeter , rhode island , said she is in discussions with the school about how to make sure the food service workers legally benefit from the donations .	state law and uconn policies restrict workers from receiving gifts related to their employment .	there is another potential problem : the school confirmed sunday that robinson had already planned to move out of state and was working his final shift that night .	but university officials have been moved by the outpouring of support , said stephanie reitz , a school spokeswoman .	they are discussing ways to do something special to recognize the dining services workers , " not just for the handling of this incident , but also for the ongoing hard work and great service they provide our students , employees and guests , " she said .	others have also latched onto to the incident as a way to help a good cause .	the school has also been contacted by three other groups , some from out of state , who have begun fundraising campaigns , reitz said .	and local franchise of the d.p. dough restaurant chain has already donated $ 600 in proceeds to a children 's cancer charity after adding jalapeno to its bacon mac and cheese calzones .	the franchise owner , cory hill , said he went through 125 pounds of macaroni and cheese in the last week , compared to the normal 20 pounds . "	i felt a little weird profiting from this situation , " he said . "	that 's when i decided to donate the proceeds to charity .	we 're probably going to keep it going . "	reitz said gatti is still enrolled in the school , and federal law prohibits her from discussing his specific case , which could lead to a hearing and eventually expulsion .

drug abusers , thieves and other nonviolent felons could shorten their sentences with good behavior under legislation signed friday by gov. jay nixon that is intended to reserve the state 's prisons only for the most dangerous and persistent criminals .	the new missouri law wo n't let people out of prison early , unlike similar money-saving initiatives in some states .	instead , it focuses on people under the supervision of probation and parole officers for certain nonviolent crimes .	for every month they go without a violation , the new law will give those offenders 30 days of credit toward their probation and parole sentences .	should they slip up , probation and parole officers would gain new authority to order them to jail for a few hours or days without undergoing a full-fledged hearing on whether to revoke their probation or parole .	and judges also could impose 120-day shock sentences behind bars as an alternative to potentially longer prison sentences that can result from probation or parole revocations .	all the options are intended to steer nonviolent offenders away from long-term prison sentences and toward treatment services they need . "	the new law wraps together some of the best research-based strategies to hold offenders accountable for their actions and stop the cycle of recidivism , " said adam gelb , director of the public safety performance project at the pew center on the states . "	it will improve public safety and help control the growing cost of the prison system . "	the legislation incorporates several recommendations made last year by a state task force that worked with the pew center .	but it stops short of making sweeping changes .	the study group , for example , said its recommendations for shortening sentences and modifying probation and parole revocations could have saved the state between $ 7.7 million and $ 16 million by 2017 .	but a financial estimate included with the legislation that ultimately passed said the state will more likely see a net savings of less than $ 1 million during the next five years .	that 's partly because the new law requires the state to reimburse county jails for holding people on probation and parole violations .	it 's because the law limits the good behavior credits to only certain nonviolent offenders and requires that they complete at least two years of their probation or parole .	nixon signed the law privately without fanfare or comment friday , merely listing it among a dozen bills that had been enacted .	last summer , nixon hosted a news conference in his office with other executive , legislative and judicial officials to highlight the start of the pew center study .	nixon spokesman scott holste said the low-key signing of the law " does n't reflect a lack of enthusiasm " for it .	he said the governor was out of the capitol on friday spending time with his family .	the missouri association of prosecuting attorneys issued a statement praising the new law for containing " common-sense reforms to the corrections system , centering on effective management of probationers as opposed to needless release of vast numbers of violent criminals . " "	by pouring more services into the front end ?	whether it 's drug treatment , education , some sort of training , and much more intensive supervision ?	the hope is that they wo n't be getting revoked and going to prison in the first place , " st. louis county prosecutor bob mcculloch , who is president of the prosecutors ' association , said in an interview .	the new law creates a 13-member sentencing and corrections oversight commission to evaluate any reductions in criminal recidivism rates , costs savings and other results of the new sentencing provisions .	house speaker steven tilley said friday that he believes history will prove the new sentencing law to be a significant accomplishment . "	in the long-run , it could save the taxpayers money , and that 's an important thing , " said tilley , r-perryville , " and i think it brings some fairness to the process . "
a proposal to merge two agencies that promote new orleans ' big-dollar tourism industry has died .	the new orleans tourism and marketing corp. opted last week to terminate merger plans with the new orleans metropolitan convention & visitors bureau .	the times-picayune reported that move came after months of discussion between the two groups failed to get an agreement on how to structure the new organization .	mayor mitch landrieu , who once strongly backed the merger , favored scrapping the plan , saying he believed the new entity should be a public body because it would receive public funds .	the marketing corporation took the same view . "	while some may have thought that the merger would have produced one organization with a singular voice in its approach to tourism , we agree with the mayor that public oversight and transparency would have been lost , " sandra shilstone , chief executive of the marketing corporation , said in a statement but amy reimer , a member of both boards , said the city needed to have a unified public relations and marketing campaign to promote tourism . "	i do n't know how we go forward now .	we 're back to square one , " reimer said .	both groups had approved the merger proposal on jan. 15 .	but board members from both groups said sticking points included whether the new organization would be public or private and how the group 's board would be put together .	according to a study by the boston consulting group released earlier this year , new orleans is one of only two cities with two tourism promotion organizations .	in a $ 2 million study , bcg examined the strengths and weaknesses of the local hospitality industry and offered suggestions on how new orleans could boost its influx of visitors .	the study was commissioned by the new orleans hospitality task force , an 18-member group with tourism interests pulled together partially by landrieu in his previous role as lieutenant governor .	the merger would have turned the five-employee marketing corporation into the marketing department of the visitors bureau , which employs 72 people .	although the merger was not complete , the two groups had already begun operating as one .	the marketing corporation will remain in the cvb building and the two organizations will continue to collaborate , marketing corporation chairman kent wasmuth said .

sun tzu , chris anderson , robert renteria , tom hopkins , larry winget and john eliot certainly are not household names in the comic book world .	but these famous motivators are the latest in a slate of best-selling authors to have graphic novels produced based on their popular books .	round table press , the publisher responsible for the recently released graphic novel translations of such books as the art of war , the ancient chinese masterpiece on strategy , and the long tail , subtitled why the future of business is selling less of more when first published in 2006 , sees the crossover to the comics medium as a natural fit between these writers and today 's generation of business readers .	ceo corey michael blake says , " the short format is perfect for professionals in the twitter generation . "	most of the business and motivational authors that round table approached with the graphic novel concept were open to the idea of adapting their content for the relatively untested waters of the comics medium .	blake concedes that when pitching a new idea like this to a best-selling author , " you usually expect to be ignored . " "	not only were these guys immediately on board , " he says , " but they were really excited about getting involved . "	anderson 's the long tail and winget 's shut up , stop whining & get a life were the first to get the graphic novel treatment . "	chris ( editor in chief of wired magazine ) was very trusting of us , which was great , " blake says . "	larry ( who has trademarked himself as the pitbull of personal development ) was trusting , too , but he was also hands-on involved every step of the way .	i think he was excited to see himself in comic book form . "	he laughs and adds : " i mean , making larry a superhero is perfect ! "	in addition to long tail and get a life , other graphic novels in the series include eliot 's overachievement , how to master the art of selling by hopkins , the art of war by sun tzu , and renteria 's mi barrio .	eliot is a performance psychologist on the faculty of rice university .	tom hopkins international offers sales training strategies .	renteria wrote the memoir from the barrio to the board room .	the ' dumbing down ' debate blake understands that there are a fair amount of people who question both the motivation and execution of these books . "	i 've been watching the discussion boards about dumbing down the country , " he says . "	i love those comments because these are almost always from people who have n't read the books . "	he adds : " i love hearing from people who complained and then read one and then realized that what we 're creating are just great abbreviated versions of already great books .	the ability to read one of these popular books in a single sitting is what people tend to like the best . "	readers also are pleased to see that the art was n't an afterthought with these books .	blake says he knew from the beginning that round table needed to select artists who felt at home in the graphic novel and comic book world .	illustrators include shane clester , bob byrne and nathan lueth .	round table has more authors lined up to produce similar graphic novels . "	our place is to help people who are making differences in other people 's lives , " blake says . "	i 'd like to keep working with those types of people . "	we really think we 're identifying a new market opportunity for these types of authors .	we 'd really like for every author to say ' i have my hardcover and softcover .	now i need my comic or graphic novel version .

the members of terre haute 's central presbyterian church celebrated three new stained-glass windows sunday , dedicated to the memory of one of their own .	the windows are now the first thing you notice when you walk into the children 's preschool sunday school room in the lower level of the church at 125 n. seventh st. downtown .	the windows , which look out onto larry bird avenue , illustrate bible stories but also show modern-day children standing with jesus christ . "	we modeled all of these ( windows ) after children 's literature that is used here , " said dave rosen , owner of artisan 's art glass , who created the windows in collaboration with several church members and with susie dewey , who donated the windows to the church .	dewey , a retired english teacher in the vigo county schools , donated the windows in honor of ruth erickson , a member of central presbyterian who passed away last year .	erickson , who worked as an elementary school librarian after raising her sons , had a fondness for children 's literature .	the windows reflect that through their illustrations , which are taken from children 's books . "	she would have loved it , " dewey said of her friend . "	this church meant a lot to her . "	erickson was active in the audubon society , and the windows also feature illustrations of colorful birds .	the windows also feature a verse from an 1885 hymn written especially for sunday school students by william h. parker .	the hymn reads : " tell me the stories of jesus i love to hear ; things i would ask him to tell me if he were here ; scenes by the wayside , tales of the sea , stories of jesus , tell them to me . "	the windows show the miraculous catch of fishes written of in the bible .	they also show a scene of children following jesus entering jerusalem . "	the kids loved the windows , " said sandy mead , a member of the church who teaches in the preschool . "	they are far out ! "	dewey said she wanted to donate the windows to the memory of her friend of more than 70 years because the windows will last , allowing erickson to be long remembered . "	i wanted it to be something that would stay and the church has staying power , " dewey said .	large portions of the windows are relatively clear , allowing a lot of light into the preschool .	that also allows the view through the windows to change over the years , rosen said . "	the idea was to bring this into the present and as the present changes , so do the windows , " he said .	erickson often worked behind the scenes , but was always active and had many interesting adventures in her life , fellow members of the church recalled . "	she was a world traveler , " recalled eileen whalen , a member of the church . "	it was always so neat to sit next to her and talk with her . "
a western new york husband and wife found dead in their burning home were killed during a home invasion and four men have been arrested in connection with the crime , authorities said thursday .	chautauqua county sheriff joseph gerace told local media outlets that 66-year-old gordon skinner and joyce skinner , 59 , were killed in what investigators believe was " a targeted act " at their home in the rural town of carroll .	their bodies were found wednesday by firefighters . "	in my 34 years , this was one of the most disturbing and troubling home invasions i have seen , " gerace said .	the sheriff did n't say how the couple was killed or offer a motive , but said the couple was n't shot .	the four suspects arrested thursday 80 miles away in elmira were identified as davide coggins , 34 , whose address was n't known , and elmira residents ricky knickerbocker , 18 , steven todd , 18 , and joshua mccormick , 21 .	jones said coggins is the son of one of gordon skinner 's cousins and " is the connection " between the suspects and victims .	he said he does n't know what was behind the attack . "	why ?	i guess god knows , " jones said .	carroll supervisor jerry jones said he grew up with the skinners . "	they were good neighbors and good friends , " he said . "	it 's quite a shock when this happens in your neighborhood . "	jones said " gordie " skinner was a former marine who worked at a local market , farmed and did carpentry and electrical work before retiring and " playing a lot of golf . "	the skinners ' deaths were discovered after joyce skinner did n't show up for work at a local manufacturing company and a friend who went to check on her found their home on fire , he said .	state prison records show coggins had been released from state prison on march 15 after serving five years for criminal possession of a forged instrument .	he 'd also been sentenced to from 1 to 3 years in prison for sodomy and attempted promotion of prison contraband , according to the records .	he was released in 2005 .	chautauqua county district attorney david foley said the suspects were being held at the county jail thursday for arraignment on unspecified charges .	a court official said it was n't initially known when the men would be in court or if they had attorneys .	police were seeking information from anyone who might have seen a 2003 gold or tan pontiac grand am the men are believed to have used .	carroll is on the pennsylvania border 65 miles south of buffalo .
when it comes to pumpkins , it pays to be painstaking .	careful attention to onerous rules helped the city of keene again break the world record for the most lit jack-o ' - lanterns .	guinness world records confirmed that 30,581 carved and lit pumpkins were displayed saturday night , topping the record of 30,128 pumpkins set by boston in 2006 .	guinness officials are sticklers , but festival organizers and volunteers work hard to meet the stringent requirements , said ruth sterling , owner of the festival 's management company , sterling design & communications .	that means rejecting pumpkins that flame out during the five-minute judging period or do n't appear to have been " intentionally designed . "	in other words , you ca n't just punch a hole in a pumpkin and consider it " carved . " "	sometimes it 's from a 4-year-old and that 's the best they can do , " sterling said . "	we get a little mad about it , but we comply . "	started in 1991 , the keene pumpkin festival netted its first world record in 1993 with fewer than 5,000 pumpkins .	before saturday , it 's most recent record-setting event was in 2003 , with 28,952 jack-o ' - lanterns .	this is the ninth time it has held the record .	in 2010 , the group that had been running the festival stepped aside because the event had grown too large to manage , but it was saved by a nonprofit organization called let it shine , inc. .	in recent years , keene has enjoyed a friendly competition with highwood , ill. , and both were featured on hgtv 's " pumpkin wars " last year .	highwood officials hoped to snatch the record with 30,919 jack-o ' - lanterns in 2011 , but guinness officials did not accept the tally .	this year 's total in highwood was 28,036 , said tali hylen of ripple public relations . "	it rained and was windy saturday night , preventing our crew from climbing scaffolding , " hylen said . "	the boards were too slick and we could n't risk safety . "	in an update posted on the keene festival 's website on monday , sterling described the moment the total was announced saturday night . "	the magic of the day can not be described quickly enough to post this , " she wrote . "	try to think of the best feeling in the world and multiplying it by 30,581 . "

an indiana school district will revise its sexual harassment policies and improve training on investigating complaints as part of a u.s. department of education settlement over a violation of title ix anti-discrimination laws .	the department 's office for civil rights announced the agreement with the laporte community school corp. on monday .	the ruling stems from charges against former laporte high school junior varsity volleyball coach robert ashcraft .	ashcraft was sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2011 on charges of sexual misconduct and child seduction .	court documents say the 48-year-old coach had sex with a teenage player about 25 times between september 2007 and the summer of 2009 .	the agreement requires the district to determine who knew of the conduct and whether other students were subjected to a sexually hostile environment .
topeka police say two men who were arrested while burglarizing a house tied to an unsolved quadruple homicide did n't have anything to do with the slayings .	the topeka capital-journal ( http://bit.ly/szn4in ) reports police found a woman and two men shot to death inside a topeka home on dec. 1 , and found a fourth victim behind a business hours later .	police received a call around 4 a.m. dec. 4 indicating someone was inside the home where the killings had occurred four hours after it had been released as a crime scene .	officers found two men in the backyard with items from inside the house .	both pleaded guilty to burglary and were sentenced earlier this year .	police say the burglary was not related to the homicides in the same home .
there have been people calling want to donate coats , books , sports equipment and other assorted goodies .	and there have been people ?	attorneys , retired teachers , great-grandmothers ?	who have been calling to offer their time as tutors , as mentors and even as basketball coaches .	the outpouring has come in response to a recent story in the indianapolis star that detailed the wish list items from teachers and administrators at a school where more than 90 percent of the families come from low income families , where some children come from homes where they 've never been read to or taught their colors , families where even having a home can sometimes be iffy .	dozens of readers had called the school by 11 a.m. offering to help ?	more than the school could immediately return . "	people are very generous , " said school 61 principal joyce buntin .	school 61 , a westside school relocated to the eastside this year while its permanent location is renovated , has around 400 students from kindergarten through grade six .	since school began in august , the star has written a series of feature stories about the children in kindergarten ?	year one ?	that has looked at the children 's readiness ( or lack thereof ) , their circumstances in life and how the school has responded .	school officials say they have material needs for everything from coats and school uniforms and books for the library .	but their greatest need , they say , is committed volunteers interested in being tutors and mentors to the children if diane bromley had a regular volunteer in her kindergarten classroom , she would have him work one-on-one with a boy who did n't arrive in her class until october and who still struggles to write his name , know his colors and count past five .	if shirley chappell had a regular classroom helper , she would give her a table of three or four children to work with , using ready-made lessons that might cover letter sounds one day or writing the next .	and if diana munter had someone volunteering in her kindergarten class , she would have them spend time with a couple of students who not only need help with academics but could just use some attention from a caring adult .	for indianapolis public school 61 , an inner-city school whose challenges with a new crop of kindergartners have been featured this year in the indianapolis star , the christmas wish list is a long one .	it includes some material things ?	warm winter coats and gloves for children who lack them ; books for the school 's undersized library ; jump ropes and other items for gym classes that , with recess , offer the best exercise option for some children from neighborhoods where it 's not safe outside .	but more than anything , the adults at school 61 say the top item on their christmas wish list would be time ?	the time of committed volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of children . "	they need , they crave that special attention , " school 61 principal joyce buntin said .	those needs are n't necessarily the things the kindergarten students would put high on their own wish lists .	most of them are dreaming of nintendo ds games , barbie dolls or remote-controlled cars .	but they have other pressing issues , too .	some come from families where having a christmas tree is n't a certainty .	others come from families where having a home is n't a certainty .	there 's the 5-year-old boy who says he wants to get his mother a bracelet for christmas .	problem is , she was arrested recently , and it 's not clear whether he will see her again before the holiday . "	my mommy got in jail , " he said . "	she was n't so bad .	she was just a little tiny bad . "	another boy , in a letter to santa , asked for a new house for his mom and dad " because we have cockroaches in our house . "	circumstances like these are not uncommon across the city .	it 's what defines educating children in an urban setting .	and it 's why teachers and schools throughout indianapolis say they could do more to help children if they had a few extra hands ?	the hands of volunteers ?	ready in their classrooms .	but school 61 has only one or two regular volunteers each week .	it does n't have a business partner .	it has n't been adopted by any church . "	they are craving attention , someone to listen to them , to be nice to them , " said carolyn kendall , another kindergarten teacher at school 61 . "	these kids do n't get quality time . "	their letters to santa ?	a classroom assignment in which the children were asked to think of a gift they would like to see santa bring another family member ?	are an indicator of what they 're thinking .	written with their teacher 's help but recopied in their own hands , some were funny , some were blatantly self-serving and some say much about the world they inhabit .	even at school 61 , where 90 percent of the children come from low-income families , most of the students show up on the first day of school in crisp , clean school uniforms .	but because they may have only one or two uniforms , the clothes begin to show some wear come december .	pizza stains accumulate .	blouses and shirts that were once bright and white become so dull they match the gray of the winter sky .	growth spurts have sent pants climbing higher on lengthening legs and rendered some shirts hopelessly untuckable .	you might think kindergarten kids would be oblivious to such things .	but these 5-year-olds , in their december-gray shirts , come to natalie hulett , the parent liaison at school 61 , and ask whether she can find something else for them to wear . "	they get embarrassed , " she said .	but by december , the pickings are slim .	hulett and school social worker brenda fuller start the year with a stash of extra shirts , pants and skirts .	they offer them to children who get soaked in spilled milk , to the little ones who wet themselves , to rowdy boys who rip their pants .	and that stockpile disappears .	with the bitter cold here , the need for winter coats , hats and gloves becomes more apparent .	buntin said she saw a boy get off the school bus recently without a heavy coat , on a morning when the wind chill was in the single digits .	the best she could glean about the boy , who was wearing a light spring jacket , was that he had given his heavy coat to another sibling who had nothing to wear .	as principal , buntin sees children in her office who need direction .	she calls parents looking for help .	sometimes she lowers the boom , with detention or suspensions .	and though she has a quick laugh , buntin is equipped with that sharp principal 's tone of voice that can rattle the nerves of even the surliest sixth-grader .	even so , she 's apt to spend 30 minutes in detention trying to find out what 's bugging the children there .	she 's also prone to telling them they could go to college if they would just take school seriously .	when she considers her wish list for school 61 , she dreams about a church or some other organization that could come in and run a character-education program ?	during lunch , after school , whenever .	she says too many children she counsels come to school with no sense of honesty , integrity , trustworthiness or perseverance ?	even etiquette . "	i believe the students are missing that part of their education they used to learn at home , but somehow they obviously are n't learning and we need to reinforce ?	good character-building skills , " she said . "	we do n't have enough hours in the day to do as much as we need to do and teach character ed . "	fuller , the school social worker , talks about meeting that need less formally , too .	the children need thoughtful adults to come into the school and be mentors ?	to listen to them over lunch and talk about things going on in their lives , to help them think about goals and to get them thinking about careers and worlds beyond the neighborhood .	erin fox came to school 61 this year as the new gym teacher .	she 's not cut from the pattern of old gym teachers who rolled out a few basketballs and took a seat in the bleachers .	she gets the kindergartners playing balloon volleyball .	she gets them to grab on to the edges of a giant round parachute and frantically wave it to strengthen their arms .	she gets them to work on their balance with stationary snowboards .	but upon arriving at school 61 , she found the school was missing a lot of tools she 'd like them to have ?	hula hoops , jump ropes , beach balls and nerf footballs . "	it 's important just for them to get a lot of fitness in , just breathing heavy , " fox said .	the cupboard also looks lean in the school library .	new media specialist marcia compliment said it 's clear the school could use more picture books , more storybooks , more nonfiction titles ( think dinosaur books ) and more dvds .	her wish list would include classroom sets of fictional series such as " diary of a wimpy kid , " '' spiderwick chronicles " and " the best christmas pageant ever . "	one problem is that school 61 , a westside school , is in temporary quarters on the eastside while its permanent home is renovated .	its library collection did n't make the trip , and the students have to draw on what 's available at their temporary location , which is n't much .	all that said , teachers at school 61 say material needs are n't the most critical issue .	they have learning materials aplenty .	their big need is for human beings .	even the ablest teacher ca n't meet everyone 's need in a classroom of 20 to 25 children , particularly when some of the children show up never having been read to , worked with or encouraged at home to explore .	the squeaky wheels ?	the misbehaving children , or the ones who ask for help ?	draw much of the teacher 's attention .	but others who remain quiet and seemingly content may not get the one-on-one help that could move them forward .	among those are children who could learn faster if there was someone on hand to help the teacher . "	more than anything , " bromley says , " they need attention . "

indiana lawmakers have deleted language in a law that threatened the state pension former first lady judy o'bannon began drawing after gov. frank o'bannon died in 2003 .	the democratic governor 's widow married attorney donald willsey in november at age 78 .	soon after , it came to light that a state employee pension law specifies that if a governor 's spouse remarries , that person will lose the governor 's pension .	once that information reached political circles , leaders of both parties agreed the law needed to be changed .	lawmakers researched the law and found that it contained a provision that applied only to the spouse of a governor who remarries .	other state employees in similar circumstances were not affected .	language deleting the provision was added to a public pension bill that passed both chambers and is now awaiting gov. mike pence 's signature , the indianapolis star reported ( http://indy.st/1qg4mqv ) saturday .	senate president pro tempore david long said that if judy o'bannon lost any pension in the interim , it would be reinstated .	he said judy o'bannon had served beside gov. o'bannon ?	who died during his second term in september 2003 after a stroke ?	throughout his years in office and she had earned the pension .

seven contraptions known as the galloping geese may be the most motley-looking machines ?	and the most endearing ?	ever to rattle down american railroad tracks .	a mash-up of vintage autos , buses and railroad cars , the geese were cobbled together in the 1930s by the rio grande southern , a luckless and threadbare railroad that served mining towns in the san juan mountains of southwestern colorado .	the railroad shut down in the 1950s , but six geese were rescued by collectors and museums .	this weekend , five of the original geese and a replica of another will make a rare joint appearance at a " goose fest " at the colorado railroad museum in golden , just west of denver . "	people can touch these things , they can ride on them , " says museum director donald tallman . "	and that 's pretty magical . "	the narrow-gauge rio grande southern was built in the 1890s to haul gold and silver out of the san juans .	financial panics , blizzards , landslides and other calamities kept the railroad on the verge of collapse for most of its first 40 years .	by 1929 , it faced extinction without a cheaper alternative to steam-powered trains .	so in 1931 , shop workers took up torches , saws and drills and tore into a used buick sedan . "	no blueprints , " says bill gould , a volunteer and former director at the golden museum . "	they just started hacking away . "	what emerged was a peculiar machine : gasoline-powered , part auto , part pickup and part railroad car .	it needed only one operator and a few gallons of gas , versus several crewmen and tons of coal for a heavy steam locomotive .	over the next five years , four pierce-arrow limos , one pierce-arrow sedan and another buick disappeared into the rio grande southern shop and emerged as geese .	the railroad called them " motors " ?	motor no. 1 , and so on ?	but everyone else called them galloping geese , and by the early 1950s , the railroad started calling them that , too .	how they got the nickname is n't clear , but aficionados have theories .	they seemed to waddle on the railroad 's uneven , worn-out tracks .	their air horns sounded like a goose honking .	they often ran with their side-hinged hood doors propped open to cool their overworked motors , making it look like they were flapping their wings .	goose lore is full of stories of derailments , lost wheels , overheated engines and brake failures . "	they never killed anybody , though , " gould says .	he makes this fact sound both surprising and impressive . "	i 've talked to people who rode them , and it was an adventure , " tallman says . "	you never knew if you were going to get there . "	the geese changed over the years , most notably when three had their limo shells replaced with sawed-off bus bodies .	one goose got an unplanned new look when it collided with a snowplow in 1949 .	the scar is still there . "	we ca n't repair that , " museum volunteer al blount says . "	it 's a historic dent . "	goose no. 1 proved to be so primitive , even by goose standards , that the railroad scrapped it in 1933 .	the other six flourished , and they kept the rio grande southern operating for a remarkable 21 years .	they hauled passengers , mail and light-weight freight while steam engines pulled ore , livestock and other heavy loads .	the railroad shut down in december 1952 .	it had lost the mail contract , a vital source of revenue , and a brief fling with the emerging tourist business failed to generate enough money .	knott 's berry farm amusement park in southern california bought one of the geese .	two stayed close to their native habitat , at the galloping goose historical society in dolores , colo. , and the telluride , colo. , volunteer fire department .	the colorado railroad museum owns the other three .	the dolores and telluride geese will be featured at the goose fest .	the museum had hoped to bag the knott 's berry farm goose for the weekend , but the deal fell through .	all the surviving geese have been restored to running condition , and they 're big crowd-pleasers .	blount , who drives no. 7 on tourist excursions around the museum 's loop track , estimates he carried more than 10,000 passengers last year . "	i 've probably hauled more passengers than the rio grande southern did , " he says .	on a recent afternoon , blount slid into the front seat of no. 7 , started the motor and gave the horn two honks .	he eased down on the accelerator and the motor roared .	the goose began to move .	it rattled over a switch , chugged up a hill and drifted down a short straight stretch , past trees and vintage railroad cars .	blount wore a dreamy smile , his head cocked slightly to the right , left arm resting in the sunny open window .	a passenger remarked that he looked happy . "	oh yeah , " he said .

bank of england governor mervyn king said tuesday that policymakers are torn on the outlook for inflation ?	suggesting they remain split on the direction of interest rates and the potential expansion of a 200-billion pound asset purchase program .	king also warned that a necessary rebalancing of the british economy after the recent recession toward more exports ?	and fewer imports ?	is at risk because of growing imbalances in global trade and called for a " grand bargain " among the major players in the world economy .	the british central bank has been faced with the difficult ?	and conflicting ?	task of dealing with surging inflation and a stuttering economic recovery since bringing interest rates down to a record low of 0.5 percent 19 months ago .	with little room left to cut rates , the bank kicked off its so-called quantitative easing program to buy assets and increase the amount of money in the economy early last year .	that program was frozen in february as inflation pushed high above its 2 percent target .	with the u.s. federal reserve signaling it may add another round of monetary expansion at its november meeting , markets are watching for signs of which way its british counterpart is leaning .	quantitative easing is intended to stimulate growth , but carries risks of inflation and undermining a country 's currency .	consumer prices rose an annual 3.1 percent in september ?	the seventh consecutive month they have been above 3 percent .	king said the nine members of the bank 's monetary policy committee are " conscious " that continuing high inflation poses the risk of an expectation-fueled increase in prices , but added " there is also a risk ?	at least as large " that inflation will fall below the target as temporary factors dissipate .	king said that a range of other indicators ?	growth in broad money , pay , and the pressure of demand on supply ?	are together likely to be a more reliable guide to inflationary pressure looking ahead . "	all remain extremely subdued , " he said .	the bank is facing growing criticism for its apparent stalemate on policy .	one mpc member , andrew sentance , has argued since june that the bank should raise rates to tackle inflation , but his colleague adam posen says that the asset purchase program should be expanded to support the economic recovery .	minutes of the october meeting , due out wednesday , will reveal if the split has widened .	king defended mpc members in the prepared text of his speech to the black country chamber of commerce in central england , saying that " because there are risks on both sides of the outlook , reasonable people can disagree . " "	after the event , no doubt whichever risk has crystallized will be described by the critics as inevitable , " he said . "	unfortunately , we do not have a crystal ball . "	king also called for a " grand bargain " among major world economies to correct distortions in the international monetary system , warning that it " will be only a matter of time before one or more countries resort to trade protectionism " if an agreement is not reached .	king said that the spirit of cooperation at a group of seven meeting of industrialized nations in washington in 2008 , where they agreed urgent and exceptional action to stabilize financial markets , " has ebbed away . " "	the major surplus and deficit countries are pursuing economic strategies that are in direct conflict , " he said .	king said that countries must consider many potential policy measures to correct the imbalance , not just exchange rates , which have become a sore point between the united states and china .	other options include changing the rules of the game for controlling capital inflows , plans to raise savings in the deficit countries , structural reforms to boost demand in the surplus countries and the role and governance of international financial institutions .
two physicians filed a challenge thursday against a decades-old new mexico law that prohibits doctors from helping terminally ill patients die .	with supporters holding signs in spanish and english , cancer doctors katherine morris and aroop mangalik filed their lawsuit with their attorneys in state district court in albuquerque .	according to the lawsuit , the doctors , both who work at the university of new mexico health science center , seek to be allowed to prescribe medication to terminally-ill patients who want to end their lives . "	this is an issue that does not get talked about much in our society , " said morris , who recently moved to new mexico from oregon , where doctors can legally help terminally-ill patients end their lives . "	and when it does , it 's generally in sound bites .	as a society , our persistent refusal to face death is hurting us and causing suffering . "	currently , new mexico law states that " whoever commits assisting suicide is guilty of a fourth degree felony . "	however , compassion & choices legal director kathryn tucker said the lawsuit asks the court to clarify state law to allow doctors to give patients the option of ending their lives .	opponents call the practice " physician-assisted suicide , " while supporters speak of " death with dignity " or " end-of-life choices . "	tucker said lawyers intend to argue that the state law does not legally prohibit doctors from ending the lives of terminally ill patients .	the lawsuit claims the law against assisted suicide " does not reference a physician providing aid in dying to a terminally-ill and mentally-competent person . "	the american civil liberties union of new mexico and the denver-based group compassion & choices are helping with the lawsuit .	both groups say they expect the battle to end up in new mexico supreme court .	phil sisneros , a spokesman for new mexico attorney general gary king , said he could not comment since the attorney general 's office has not had an opportunity to review the lawsuit .	if new mexico physicians are allowed to assist terminally-ill patients in ending their lives , doctors say they would prescribe medication that would be taken by patients on their own timetable .	voters in oregon and washington have passed " right to die " laws , while montana 's supreme court ruled that the practice of physicians helping terminally-ill patients end their lives could be considered part of medical treatments .	but most other states have adopted laws that call for prison time for those found guilty of the practice .	nearly 600 terminally-ill patients in oregon have opted to end their lives since the state law went into effect in 1998 , according to state numbers .	in washington , a total of 135 patents took the option in 2009 and 2010 , the state 's latest numbers show .	mangalik said around a third of terminally-ill patients who were prescribed medication to end their lives opted not to take it and instead died of natural causes . "	patients just wanted the option , " he said . "	they wanted to feel as if they are in control . "

a firsthand account of the navy seal raid that killed osama bin laden contradicts previous accounts by administration officials , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when he was first fired upon .	bin laden apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top-floor hallway of his compound as seals rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction , according to former navy seal matt bissonnette , writing under the pseudonym mark owen in " no easy day . "	the book is to be published next week by penguin group ( usa ) 's dutton imprint .	bissonnette says he was directly behind a " point man " going up the stairs . "	less than five steps " from the top of the stairs , he heard " suppressed " gunfire : " bop .	bop . "	the point man had seen a " man peeking out of the door " on the right side of the hallway .	the author writes that bin laden ducked back into his bedroom and the seals followed , only to find the terrorist crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of his head and two women wailing over his body .	bissonnette says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other seals trained their guns ' laser sites on bin laden 's still-twitching body , shooting him several times until he lay motionless .	the seals later found two weapons stored by the doorway , untouched , the author said .	in the account related by administration officials after the raid in pakistan , the seals shot bin laden only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon .	white house spokesman tommy vietor would not comment on the apparent contradiction late tuesday .	but he said in an email , " as president obama said on the night that justice was brought to osama bin laden , ' we give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country . ' " "	no easy day " was due out sept. 11 , but dutton announced the book would be available a week early , sept. 4 , because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the amazon.com and barnes & noble.com best-seller lists .	the associated press purchased a copy of the book tuesday .	in another possibly uncomfortable revelation for u.s. officials who say bin laden 's body was treated with dignity before being given a full muslim burial at sea , the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound , one of the seals called " walt " was sitting on bin laden 's chest as the body lay at the author 's feet in the middle of the cabin .	the publisher says the author used pseudonyms for all the seals .	bissonnette also writes disparagingly that none of the seals were fans of president barack obama and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the may 2011 raid .	one of the seals said after the mission that they had just gotten obama re-elected by carrying out the raid .	but he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go-ahead .	u.s. officials fear the book may include classified information , as it did not undergo the formal review required by the pentagon for works published by former or current defense department employees .	officials from the pentagon and the cia , which commanded the mission , are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author .	in a statement provided to the associated press , the author says he did " not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way .

state lawmakers are planning to scrape together about $ 10 million to provide a financial bailout to delaware 's three gambling casinos .	much of the money to fund the proposed bailout would come from dollars left unspent from an $ 8 million casino relief effort that lawmakers approved last year to help the casinos cover anticipated increases in slot-machine vendor costs .	sen. brian bushweller , d-dover , who is leading the latest casino bailout effort , said tuesday that $ 5 million from last year 's plan remains unspent .	another $ 3.2 million would be drawn from a previous appropriation for a kent county sports complex project that has been delayed , and roughly $ 1 million is available from an unspent 2012 appropriation for an economic development infrastructure fund , bushweller said .	delaware 's three casinos have complained for years about competition from casinos in maryland and pennsylvania that have drawn away gamblers who used to travel to delaware .	the casinos also are not happy about the share of gambling revenues they have to give to delaware 's general fund . "	the rates were fine during the heyday of the casino business in delaware , but once the competition from out of state hit , now the rates became too much , " said bushweller , whose district includes the dover downs casino . "	they 're like the straw that broke the camel 's back . "	even so , lawmakers have yet to agree with gov. jack markell 's administration plan on a comprehensive plan to ensure the viability of delaware 's casinos . "	this will be the second year in a row we 're doing band-aids , " bushweller said .	a study commission led by markell 's finance secretary , tom cook , recommended earlier this year that the state split 75 percent of slot-machine vendor costs with the casinos , rather than having the casinos continue to pay the full amount from their share of gambling revenue .	the change would cost the state 's general fund about $ 10 million a year .	the commission also proposed eliminating the annual $ 3 million table-games fee paid by the casinos starting july 1 , 2015 , and reducing the state 's share of table-game revenue from 29.4 percent to 15 percent , at an estimated annual cost of $ 7.2 million .	the commission 's recommendations formed the basis of legislation that bushweller introduced last month .	but the bill is being pared back because lawmakers have little money available after the drafting of operating and capital budget bills for the fiscal year starting july 1 , bushweller said .	the revised bill will call for the state to help pay vendor costs for slot machines , but proposals to eliminate the casinos ' annual $ 3 million table-games fee and to reduce the state 's share of table-game revenue will be dropped . "	it does n't do enough on a permanent basis , " bushweller said of his legislation , which was scheduled for a senate vote late tuesday . "	ultimately , we have to reach some kind of an accord on how we 're going to stabilize the casino industry going forward . "

ducks and geese and maybe even bees stand to benefit from an expansion of north dakota land into certain federal conservation programs .	the u.s. department of agriculture is accepting an additional 25,000 acres of land in the state into programs under the conservation reserve program umbrella targeted at wetlands and other wildlife habitat .	of the total , 10,000 acres is devoted to state acres for wildlife enhancement , or safe , which pays landowners to idle land to create wildlife habitat .	another 10,000 acres is for a program targeted at duck nesting habitat , with the remaining 5,000 acres for a wetland restoration program .	the new acres are part of a national allocation of 800,000 acres for the wildlife and wetland initiatives under the more general crp , which pays landowners to idle environmentally fragile property .

"	that spurs economic development like hunting and fishing , outdoor recreation and tourism all over rural america . "	more than 300,000 acres had previously been allocated for the initiatives in north dakota , providing habitat for ducks , geese , pheasant , prairie chickens and sage grouse .	aaron krauter , state director for the federal farm service agency , announced the additional 25,000 acres in late july , saying " we hope to continue this progress . "	landowners have filled nearly all of the previously allocated acres , and fsa expects the additional acres to be filled quickly , said brad olson , the agency 's program director for conservation in north dakota .	the initiatives are so popular in the state that the fsa office late last year requested and received nearly 83,000 additional acres for safe and a wetlands program .	those acres were taken from other states where they were n't being used .	in may , a farmer in lamoure county enrolled 300 acres in safe , putting the program over the 1 million-acre mark nationally .

wyoming businesses are preparing to weather a long economic downturn , and the state is fairing better in this recession than it did during the 1980s energy bust , an official with a state business advocacy group said .	the wyoming business alliance/wyoming heritage foundation last week completed a series of forums on the economy in cheyenne , casper , gillette , sheridan , riverton and rock springs .	bill schilling , president of the organization , said in meeting with business owners around the state that he found " cautious optimism . "	some businesses have trimmed payrolls and fixed costs because of nervousness about the economy , schilling said . "	but that said it 's a lot safer to live in wyoming employmentwise , investmentwise , opportunitywise than in other states , " he said .	schilling said he found that business owners understand the economy will be tight for the next few years but they are making strategic decisions to weather it . "	and that 's an important bridge in of itself because when the storm comes you can be in denial or you can say ' let 's get about dealing with it , ' " he said . "	and they 're more in the ' let 's get about dealing with it mode than denial .	and that 's an important transformation . "	a few businesses have closed and more jobs might be shed , especially by local governments trying to deal with reduced tax revenue , schilling said .	but some technology , retail and natural resources businesses are hiring again , he said . "	there are pockets of success and those pockets should radiate out and create more pockets of success , " he said .	in addition , schilling said few businesses have closed their doors compared to the 1980s when an oil boom went bust and the state lost about 10 percent of its population . "	it 's not anywhere close to ' 85 , ' 86 , ' 87 , " he said . "	you do n't have the store vacancies in your downtown areas like you did then . "	while the state lost thousands of energy and construction jobs last year , wyoming has avoided the housing and banking finance crisis that has plagued other states and the energy industry seems to be holding its own in northeast and southwest wyoming , he said .	any population decline from the current recession should n't exceed 3 percent , he said .	however , there are concerns about whether federal government policies on sage grouse and coal-bed methane leasing will crimp the state 's economy by limiting development and natural gas production , schilling said .

when it comes to storing carbon , no national forest in the united states does more than the eugene-based willamette , according to a survey released by an environmental group .	in an analysis of data collected by the u.s. forest service , the wilderness society found that among the federally owned national forests , the top 10 for carbon storage are all in the pacific northwest , six of them in oregon .	the pacific northwest climate offers plentiful rain and moderate temperatures that encourage tree growth , and the willamette national forest , at nearly 1.7 million acres , is a colossal forest .	only two of the other forests on the list are bigger .	so the wilderness society report is no big surprise to mark harmon , an oregon state university professor of forest ecology , who has been studying carbon storage in forests for decades .	if anything , the results might underestimate the amount of carbon stored because the current science is better at estimating what 's held in live trees , than what 's in a forest 's soils and dead wood , which also store carbon , he said .	the survey highlights the role forests ' carbon storage may play in slowing global warming .	during photosynthesis , trees take in and convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen .	most of the sugar becomes cellulose ?	a key component in wood .	scientists estimate that 45 percent of a tree 's wood is carbon-based .	carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that 's given off in burning fossil fuels such as coal , oil or wood .	these gases form a blanket around the planet that 's trapping heat and leading to climate change , most scientists agree .	the capacity of the world 's forests to absorb and hold carbon has been receiving intense scrutiny as an important beneficial action .	a study published last summer in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences concluded that oregon < s forests are among the best in the world at storing carbon , second only to forests in australia .	the willamette , once the nation 's top timber producer before enforcement of federal laws severely limited logging , is home to many stands of big old trees , said michael anderson , a senior resource analyst with the wilderness society . "	we knew where old growth habitat was , " anderson said . "	we had a sense that the northwest had a lot bigger trees and denser vegetation than other parts of the country .	and the willamette national forest in particular has always been seen as an especially productive forest .

wisconsin gov. scott walker hoped to win his third election in four years tuesday after a hard-fought campaign with democratic businesswoman mary burke , and victory could spur him to a bigger stage with a run for the 2016 republican presidential nomination .	polls had the race tied or nearly even for months , until last week when walker was shown to be up by 7 points in a respected marquette university survey .	very few voters were undecided , even as walker and burke and their backers flooded the airwaves and spent an estimated $ 50 million to $ 60 million on the race .	democrats and labor unions targeted walker for defeat this year after he took on public sector unions shortly after coming into office in 2011 , then became the first governor in u.s. history to survive a recall election spurred by anger in 2012 over a law that stripped public unions of much of their power .	that fight made him a hero to conservatives and put him in the mix for a potential 2016 republican presidential run , even as he 's downplayed that talk during his re-election campaign against burke .	walker argued that he deserves a second term because he wiped out a $ 3.6 billion budget shortfall , took on special interests such as the unions , cut taxes by $ 2 billion and presided over the addition of more than 110,000 private-sector jobs .	walker did it all with the support of a republican-controlled legislature .	but burke argued wisconsin could have done better .	walker promised that wisconsin would add 250,000 new private-sector jobs during his first term , which he did not come close to fulfilling .	next year 's budget faces a $ 1.8 billion shortfall , and burke argues walker left wisconsin more divided than ever .	she takes an opposite approach to walker on several major issues .	while walker backs a statewide private school voucher program , burke wants to end it .	she wants to take federal money to expand medicaid under president barack obama 's health overhaul , while walker rejected it .	she is for restoring collective bargaining power to public workers lost under walker .	and burke also supports raising the minimum wage , which walker opposes .	burke says that she wants to give everyone in the state a fair shot at success , while walker says he 's led wisconsin on a comeback that would be stalled with a change in leadership .	the economy was on jim vite 's mind when he voted for walker . "	we 've made outstanding gains .	the state is doing better than it has in quite some time , " said vite , a 49-year-old bank network administrator from cedarburg .	but janis kinens , a 69-year-old lutheran pastor who lives in cedarburg , said he thought walker 's economic decisions " have been very bad our state . " "	what he did with the teachers some years ago was a horrific thing , " said kinens , referring to the union law , which affected teachers statewide .	with voters nearly equally divided headed into election day , who wins could turn on which side does a better job getting their backers to the polls .	democrats have traditionally done better in presidential election years ?	no republican has won the state since ronald reagan in 1984 ?	while the gop does better in midterms .	but wisconsin voters have been fickle in recent elections .	just five months after walker won his recall in june 2012 , the state re-elected president barack obama by 7 points and chose democrat tammy baldwin over former republican gov. tommy thompson for the u.s. senate .	walker has spent nearly his entire adult life in politics , having first been elected in 1993 to a state assembly seat .	burke 's father started trek bicycles in the 1970s , and she worked there two different times as an executive .	she was elected to the madison school board in 2012 .	burke spent $ 5 million of her own personal wealth on the race , one-third of the $ 15 million her campaign brought in .	walker has raised $ 25 million since the middle of 2013 , but outside groups spent millions more .

state house members on wednesday overwhelmingly approved a bill fast-tracked by the markell administration in response to complaints from fraternal organization and veterans groups who were told to stop operating illegal slot machines .	the bill , approved on 34-1 vote and sent to the senate , allows the groups to resume slot machine gambling until june 30 while lawmakers work on a permanent measure allowing the groups to offer legal gambling .	veterans groups and fraternal organizations such as the moose and elks complained after receiving cease-and-desist letters from the markell administration in november reminding them that they were violating the law by operating the slot machines .	in response , the administration began talks to appease the politically active groups , while continuing to crack down on other delawareans engaged in similar activities .	earlier this month , the state department of safety and homeland security announced the arrest of a selbyville restaurant manager on charges of having an illegal gambling device after agents said they found two electronic gambling machines made available for certain patrons .	last week , dshs announced the similar arrest of a hockessin man in connection with the alleged operation of an illegal gambling device at a wilmington service station .	but when asked last week how many arrests had been made and machines seized related to the illegal gambling by fraternal organizations , dshs spokeswoman kim chandler simply answered " none . "	markell spokeswoman cathy rossi would not explain why the administration seemed to be enforcing the law differently . "	the governor does not make arrests or direct the prosecution priorities for the state police , local law enforcement or the attorney general , and the governor did not send the cease and desist letter or have knowledge ahead of time that that it was going to be sent , " rossi said in an email wednesday .	markell , who oversees the state police , nevertheless worked with democratic house members to quickly pass a bill allowing the fraternal organizations to resume gambling . "	i ca n't believe i 'm standing here supporting organizations that were doing something illegal , " rep. helene keeley , d-wilmington , said wednesday after house members suspended rules to take up the bill .	at the same time , keeley complained that wilmington has many small civic clubs and organizations that do charitable work but are not covered under the bill . "	they do the exact same things but yet they are not included in this temporary fix .	... it 's not right , " she said .	while the fraternal clubs argued that they used proceeds from the illegal gambling to fund charitable activities , they also warned that some organizations may have to close their doors if the gambling ban remains in place , suggesting that they were using the money for operating expenses .	state finance secretary tom cook acknowledged that the bill approved wednesday allows fraternal organizations to use gambling proceeds to pay for operating expenses .	as written , the bill applies to fraternal or veterans organization with national affiliations or whose membership consists primarily of veterans or active duty service members .	organizations would be allowed to have up to 20 slot machines and would have to pay between 50 percent and 70 percent of total annual proceeds to players , less than the 92 percent payout required of the state 's three casinos .	of the remaining proceeds , the state would receive 43.5 percent .

an arizona house committee gave initial approval wednesday to a pair of bills that provide generous tax breaks for companies that expand or invest in new startups , and added on a 2 percent tax deduction for the self-employed valued at $ 58 million a year .	the bills build on previous republican efforts to make arizona 's tax climate more favorable for businesses , but minority democrats argue they come at the expense of education and other state spending .	they also argue that there 's no accountability provisions that ensure the tax breaks are doing what they 're advertised to do , although because they 're targeted tax cuts democrats have less heartburn with them than with blanket tax cuts .	the first bill creates a tax credit for insurance companies that invest in a new high-tech fund overseen by the arizona commerce authority .	republican house speaker andy tobin 's bill gives insurers a credit against their premium taxes of up to $ 10 million in the budget year beginning july 1 and $ 20 million in the next two years .	they can carry unused credits forward for 15 years if they ca n't use it in the year it 's earned .	the commerce authority would administer the fund and use it to help high-tech businesses relocate or expand .	the state would recover the first $ 50 million in credits from profits earned from their investments and split any additional revenue , but there 's no guarantee any of the money would be repaid .	the second bill that passed the commerce committee wednesday lowers the property tax rate for businesses that expand and add jobs .	the value of that tax break is n't yet known .	the property tax break was included as a so-called strike-everything amendment to a minor bill by committee chairman tom forese .	forese , r-chandler , pushed the bill through committee and added an additional last-minute amendment creating the 2 percent tax deduction self-employed arizonans on their first $ 113,700 of income .	foresee said the tax deduction only targeted the self-employed because of scope and cost . "	we asked the question what 's the biggest impact we could make with the smallest amount of money , " he said .	the bills championed by tobin and forese are designed to draw business to the state by making arizona more competitive in the region .	tobin has said previous business tax breaks passed two years ago pushed arizona to fourth from ninth place in the nine-state western region .	and there are more provisions to come , forese promised . "	we want to send a message to business and entrepreneurs that arizona is the place to be , " he said .	but they come before the bulk of a republican-championed 2011 economic development package comes on line .	business tax cuts valued at $ 538 million when fully in place in 2018 and a capital gains tax cut benefiting high-income arizonans valued at $ 108 million are key parts of that package .	they also come during a tight budget year when a temporary sales tax that brought in about $ 1 billion a year and helped the state avoid more budgets cuts is set to expire .	minority democrats generally oppose additional tax cuts , arguing the state needs to restore funding to schools and services cut during the great recession . "	we know that the legislature has been very active in reducing businesses tax liabilities , " said rep. debbie mccune davis , who opposed forese 's bill because of the individual tax breaks . "	what they have n't been diligent about is making sure that we have enough money to pay our bills to sustain our infrastructure and to maintain quality education .	and we need to have both conversations . "	the forese bill also drew criticism from a fellow republican , who argued that throwing tax breaks to specific groups created less incentive to do broad-based tax reform . "	if we are intent on being the most attractive , and every state is doing something different ... let 's just have a walmart policy that says we 'll match everything , " rep. j.d. mesnard . "	maybe then we would be the super ultra-competitive from every state 's perspective . "	mesnard voted for the bill anyway . "	i think we have a window of opportunity right now with california - california is raising taxes , it has a nasty regulatory environment that is pushing businesses elsewhere , and many of them are going to texas , " forese said . "	this is a temporary solution , speaking specifically to the property ( tax cuts ) , that will allow us to exploit this opportunity in california . "
republican-leaning states will gain at least a half dozen house seats thanks to the 2010 census , which found the nation 's population growing more slowly than in past decades but still shifting to the south and west .	the census bureau announced tuesday that the nation 's population on april 1 was 308,745,538 , up from 281.4 million a decade ago .	the growth rate for the past decade was 9.7 percent , the lowest since the great depression .	the nation 's population grew by 13.2 percent from 1990 to 2000 .	michigan was the only state to lose population during the past decade .	nevada , with a 35 percent increase , was the fastest-growing state .	the new numbers are a boon for republicans , with texas leading the way among gop-leaning states that will gain house seats , mostly at the rust belt 's expense .	following each once-a-decade census , the nation must reapportion the house 's 435 districts to make them roughly equal in population , with each state getting at least one seat .	that triggers an often contentious and partisan process in many states , which will draw new congressional district lines that can help or hurt either party .	texas will gain four new house seats , and florida will gain two .	gaining one each are arizona , georgia , nevada , south carolina , utah and washington .	ohio and new york will lose two house seats each .	losing one house seat are illinois , iowa , louisiana , massachusetts , michigan , missouri , new jersey and pennsylvania .	florida will now have as many u.s. house members as new york : 27 .	california will still have 53 seats , and texas will climb to 36 .	in 2008 , president barack obama lost in texas and most of the other states that are gaining house seats .	he carried most of the states that are losing house seats , including ohio and new york .	each house district represents an electoral vote in the presidential election process , meaning the political map for the 2012 election will tilt somewhat more republican .	if obama were to carry the same states he won in 2008 , they would net him six fewer electoral votes under the new map .	some states obama won , such as florida , tilted republican in last month 's election and the electoral votes they will gain could further help gop candidates in 2012 .	white house press secretary robert gibbs said he did not expect the census results to have a " huge practical impact " on national politics .	for the first time in its history , democratic-leaning california will not gain a house seat after a census .	since 1940 , 79 house seats have shifted to the south and west , mainly from the northeast and midwest , census officials said .	starting early next year , most state governments will use detailed , computer-generated data on voting patterns to carve neighborhoods in or out of newly drawn house districts , tilting them more to the left or right .	sometimes politicians play it safe , quietly agreeing to protect republican and democratic incumbents alike .	but sometimes the party in control will gamble and aggressively try to reconfigure the map to dump as many opponents as possible .	last month 's elections put republicans in full control of numerous state governments , giving the gop an overall edge in the redistricting process .	state governments ' ability to gerrymander districts is somewhat limited , however , by court rulings that require roughly equal populations , among other things .	the 1965 voting rights act protects ethnic minorities in several states that are subject to u.s. justice department oversight .	the average population of a new u.s. house district will be 710,767 .	but each state must have at least one district .	so wyoming , the least populous state with 563,626 residents , will have a representative with considerably fewer constituents .	six other states will have one house member .	each state has two u.s. senators , regardless of population .	the u.s. is still growing quickly relative to other developed nations .	the population in france and england each increased roughly 5 percent over the past decade , while in japan the number is largely unchanged , and germany 's population is declining .	china grew at about 6 percent ; canada 's growth rate is roughly 10 percent .	the south had the fastest growth since 2000 , at 14.3 percent , the census bureau said .	the west was close behind at 13.8 percent .	the northeast had 3.2 percent growth while the midwest had 3.9 percent .	the declining u.s. growth rate since 2000 is due partly to the economic meltdown in 2008 , which brought u.s. births and illegal immigration to a near standstill compared with previous years .	the 2010 count represents the number of people ?	citizens as well as legal and illegal immigrants ?	who called the u.s. their home on april 1 .	states losing political clout may have little recourse to challenge the census numbers .	still , census officials were bracing for the possibility of lawsuits seeking to revise the 2010 findings .	the release of state apportionment numbers is the first set of numbers from the 2010 census .	beginning in february , the census bureau will release population and race breakdowns down to the neighborhood level for states to redraw congressional boundaries .	louisiana , virginia , new jersey and mississippi will be among the first states to receive their redistricting data in february .	the 2010 census results also are used to distribute more than $ 400 billion in annual federal aid and will change each state 's electoral college votes beginning in the 2012 presidential election .

the university of illinois system has hired a new president with an extensive scientific background and familiarity with the deep pockets required to run a university .	state university of new york vice chancellor for research timothy l. killeen will oversee the three university of illinois campuses and their multibillion-dollar operating budget when president robert easter retires in june .	killeen , 62 , said he is " in awe of the university of illinois " when he was introduced wednesday at the university of illinois-chicago . "	i believe that the university of illinois can define and exemplify what public higher education must become , " killeen , who will be the school 's 20th president , said . "	and i do n't mean a ranking .	i mean by meaningful and substantive contributions to society .

new york fashion week brought its cutting-edge style uptown on thursday , opening its spring-collection previews in a new location at lincoln center .	gone are the tents at bryant park where hundreds of designers had launched runways since 1993 .	instead , an estimated 100,000 buyers , editors , stylists and celebrities will visit the new home of mercedes-benz fashion week .	while most shows will still be in tents , located just southwest the landmark fountain that usually welcomes opera and ballet lovers , the facilities ( and the faux marble facade ) have a feeling of permanence .	it was time for fashion to take its place at a new york institution of fine arts , said stephanie winston wolkoff , a former vogue employee who now is serving as lincoln center 's liaison to this new community . "	fashion designers are truly creative people .	it 's not just a business when it comes to these collections , " she said .	mayor michael bloomberg visited the site on wednesday , taking the newly christened no. 1 " fashion line " subway there .	the new name is temporary , lasting only through the eight days of fashion shows from designers such as diane von furstenberg , zac posen , tommy hilfiger , carolina herrera and vera wang . "	project runway " and one of its alumni , christian siriano , were the marquee shows on opening day .	new york fashion week , which extends into other neighborhoods , " creates major excitement that ripples through the city , " bloomberg said .	he noted that fashion is responsible for 175,000 jobs in new york , and that the two fashion-show seasons have a $ 750 million impact on the local economy .	bloomberg then reported that he bought his tie at hermes , shirt at paul stuart and underwear at bloomingdale 's .	christian siriano christian siriano fans know from his " project runway " days that he has a flair for the dramatic , but what 's winning him praise with the sometimes tough-to-please crowd at new york fashion week is his sense of his customer .	he successfully juggled the two on thursday .	first out on the runway was a buttery caramel-colored safari jacket with slim-fit white trousers ?	an appropriately luxe , chic outfit for women of many ages and many climates ?	while the finale gown was a bright-red , one-shoulder tulle gown that looked like a walking bed of roses .	every look was paired with crazy platform shoes with cone-shaped heels that will be offered by the mass-market payless .	leather looks , especially a cognac wing-sleeve jacket and thick belt worn over a strapless organza pleated gown , were a highlight , and so were his modern treatments of metallic tweed , giraffe-print taffeta and snakelike embossing .	a red-print cocktail dress with draped sleeves was a pretty , refreshing alternative to the usual little black dress .	asymmetrical flounces ?	reminiscent of a pageant sash ?	were less contemporary , though .	project runway jessica simpson took her seat as guest judge at thursday 's " project runway " show at new york fashion week in a super-short , sparkly silver minidress , but she had nothing on the models , who wore an extraordinary number of hot pants .	ten aspiring designers showed their collections to simpson , heidi klum , michael kors and nina garcia , although several knew they already did n't make the cut and wo n't be the season 8 winner .	extra designers needed to participate to keep secret the winners and losers of episodes that have n't yet aired on lifetime .	opening the show , klum , wearing a bright red menswear-style pantsuit and blouse , said she was particularly fond of this group . "	i have never gotten so emotional or attached to the designers . "	she promised the audience , which included singer jordin sparks and designer betsey johnson , that they 'd see color and fantasy on the catwalk .	the crowd also saw an uneven mix of runway-ready , masterful looks and gimmicky ones ?	especially those micro mini shorts that do n't typically garner the best reviews when top-tier designers bring them back .	johnson said she saw " sparks of talent " among the designers when she judged a challenge to turn party supplies into wearable clothes . "	it was not up my alley , but there definitely was talent . "	richard chai richard chai was feeling the vibe of lincoln center , turning out a spring collection for his love label that mimicked styles favored by professional dancers and the students at the juilliard school .	layers , hardly new as a trend , were tweaked and freshened with sheer , sand-colored underpinnings , ribbed cummerbunds and soft , silky running shorts with contrast piping .	the silhouettes were loose and flowy , but decidedly feminine thanks to the soothing neutral palette and strategic draping .	in his notes left for the stylists , editors and retailers , chai quoted martha graham : " all that is important is this one moment in movement .	make the moment important , vital and worth living .	do not let it slip away unnoticed and unused . "	loose leggings were worn under shorts and dresses as the new take on tights , and a silk-poly-metal fabric blend used for jackets and a pair of chic trousers was stiff yet slouchy .	chai also brought back the wide-leg palazzo pant , an easy choice for a warm-weather vacation , often pairing it with an appropriately crinkled jacket or gathered top .	this could be a further evolution of the trouser trend that has taken hold among the fashion-forward set for fall .	vena cava the vena cava girls took a tour through the '80s with inspiration from memphis , an italian design movement dating back to the 1980s known for bold colors and geometric shapes .	designers lisa mayock and sophie buhai showed a collection heavy on black , red , aquamarine green , rust and bright yellow .	beige culottes were paired with a black zip-up jacket .	netting was used on the back of a beige romper and on a cream cotton dress , tied with a rope belt and worn under a beige blazer . "	they are almost like disco silhouettes , some of them .	they 're clothes that you could just dance all night in , that you feel totally comfortable doing anything in , " said mayock .	some dresses had asymmetrical hemlines : longer on the sides and short in back and front . "	we also have a lot of day gowns .	we are kind of sick of seeing of the lbds ( little black dresses ) .	we liked the idea of girls wearing floor length things really casually , " buhai said .

a federal court on monday rejected a state senator 's claim that a redistricting panel intentionally diluted the black vote in his district , ruling the decrease stemmed from politics but not racial discrimination .	a three-judge panel upheld the boundaries for the east arkansas district currently held by democratic sen. jack crumbly .	the judges rejected a lawsuit by crumbly and residents in his district who said the board of apportionment violated the u.s. constitution by lowering the number of voting-age blacks .	crumbly accused the board of intentionally lowering the black voting age population from 55 percent to about 53 percent .	crumbly , who is black , lost to state rep. keith ingram , who is white , in the may primary for his senate seat .	no republican is running in the district .	the maps for arkansas ' 100 house and 35 senate seats are drawn by the board of apportionment .	the board is made up of gov. mike beebe , attorney general dustin mcdaniel and secretary of state mark martin .	the legislative maps were approved on a 2-1 vote last year .	mcdaniel and beebe , both democrats , voted for the plan .	martin , a republican , opposed it and has argued he should n't be held responsible for the map because of that opposition .	the judges said evidence showed the decrease in black voting age population likely was an unintended consequence of the democrats ' political concerns , not racial animus . "	this may be regrettable , but it is not unconstitutional , " the ruling said .	beebe said he had n't yet read the ruling but was pleased with the panel 's decision . "	there was n't any intent to discriminate .	it was just the opposite , " beebe told reporters at the state capitol . "	it was trying to maintain those districts , and the court saw it that way . "	the maps approved reduced the number of majority black house districts from 13 to 11 and maintained four majority black senate districts .	mcdaniel said he was grateful for the court 's ruling and said the panel 's maps were drawn to meet " sound , legal redistricting principles . " "	though population shifts in the delta required the district to be redrawn , there was never any racial discrimination in the creation of that district or any others , " mcdaniel said in a statement released by his office .	during a hearing in may , crumbly 's attorneys argued that the redistricting map was crafted to help ingram in his bid for the seat .	the panel rejected that argument . "	we find credible governor beebe 's and attorney general mcdaniel 's testimony that they did not engage in intentional discrimination or know that representative ingram , or any other white incumbent , would run for senator against senator crumbly in senate district 24 at the time that the district map was drawn , " the ruling said .	crumbly said he was disappointed with the ruling , saying it would make it more difficult for blacks to win representation in the legislature . "	i see this as being even more of a challenge moving forward , " crumbly said .	his attorney , james valley , said he did not know if he would appeal the ruling to the u.s. supreme court and also said he was worried about the deterrent effect the ruling would have . "	it 's probably going to keep the racial divide pretty deep in this part of the country , " valley said .	the judges in may dismissed martin from the part of the suit that accused the panel of intentional discrimination , and martin has argued he wanted a higher percentage of black voters in the district .	former congressman asa hutchinson , who represented martin in the case , said he was disappointed with the court 's ruling . "	it makes it much more easy for minority representation to be diluted by the political actions of a board of apportionment and there 's no legal remedy for that , " hutchinson said .	in the ruling , the judges noted beebe said he discarded most of martin 's suggestions during the redistricting process . "	we stress that our determination that no illegal vote dilution or intentional discrimination occurred does not mean that the plaintiffs did not raise important concerns about the arkansas redistricting process , " the judges said in their ruling . "	because the board acted within the bounds of the law , those concerns are for the voters of arkansas , not for the courts of the united states , to address . "

ron paul 's army of supporters in maine flexed their muscle saturday as they elected their candidate for chairman of the state republican convention , a first step toward taking over key party committees and giving the texas congressman a voice at this summer 's national convention . "	i think it shows that our numbers are here , " aaron quinn , a 28-year-old paul supporter from brunswick , said after the close chairmanship vote .	paul supporter brent tweed , a state committee member from york county , was elected chairman with 1,118 delegates ' votes , just four more votes than the mainstream candidate , charles cragin , a one-time gubernatorial candidate .	a paul supporter was also narrowly elected secretary .	the votes were largely symbolic but important because they show the level of support at the crowded convention for the libertarian-leaning paul .	his supporters ' real goals were to elect majorities on republican county , state and national committees ?	and elect a majority of the state 's delegates to this summer 's gop national convention in tampa , fla. .	delivering 13 of maine 's 24 delegates to paul would ensure he gets a chance to address the convention , said matthew mcdonald of belfast , a paul-supporting delegate . "	that 's why maine today is really , really important , " mcdonald said .	nevada republicans , who were holding their convention saturday , also expected a strong paul showing .	paul 's supporters said he needed delegate majorities in six states to address the convention and either maine or nevada could put him over the top .	the highly organized paul forces helped to swell the convention delegate count to around 3,000 , well over the previous high of about 2,500 , party leaders said .	paul forces were anxious to show their might after february 's nonbinding presidential caucus vote , which gave mitt romney a win but which many gop members said was bungled by party leaders .	while many of the delegates at saturday 's convention wore stickers supporting presumptive presidential nominee romney , they were far less vocal than the paul forces , who had draped large banners with the candidate 's name from the balcony rails at the augusta civic center .	a number of the delegates consider themselves abos ?	anybody but ( president barack ) obama . "	if obama were running against the devil , i 'd vote for the devil , " said marc held , a delegate from yarmouth .	despite his strong support in maine and other states , paul has n't won a single state since the primaries and caucuses started in january , though he 's been picking up national convention delegates in caucus states where the delegate selection process plays out over several months .	paul is well behind the other three candidates in the race for delegates with 83 , according an associated press count .	romney is less than 300 delegates away from the 1,144 needed to win the nomination .	the other two candidates with delegates , former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum and former house speaker newt gingrich , have since dropped out of the race .	mainstream republicans , meanwhile , were making the best of their narrow loss in the initial vote for convention chairman . "	i think it 's a democratic process with a small d , " cragin said . "	i just hope this enthusiasm continues with some longevity after tampa . "	votes for a party platform , national delegates and national committee members were also scheduled for saturday .	paul supporters said they had no objections to the platform , which included calls for fiscal prudence and no new taxes , strong local and weak national governments , making english the official language of maine , right to work and voter id law , and other items .	two years ago , tea party activists who showed up in force at the convention forced changes that left their mark on the platform .

for three years , joshua dorn enjoyed the peace and comforts of his quaint neighborhood in detroit 's historic west village .	the homes and lawns were well-kept .	neighbors were friendly , and the streets felt safe for walking .	then came the drug-dealing squatters .	roughly two months ago , neighbors said , people believed to be dealing drugs took over a century-old cape cod , wreaking havoc on the neighborhood .	crimes followed .	fears escalated , especially after the trespassers ordered cable ?	a sign they were planning to stay .	neighbors and dorn , a lifelong detroiter and president of the west village association , fought back .	at 8:30 p.m. wednesday , police raided the house and arrested three people ?	including a 34-year-old convicted drug dealer and habitual offender who was out on parole .	he was charged with delivering heroin after authorities said he sold drugs to an undercover officer on wednesday .	the two others were arrested on misdemeanor charges .	police also recovered cash , marijuana and drug paraphernalia from the house .	about three hours after the raid , someone firebombed the house .	no one was hurt .	the bank-owned home was secured thursday , although neighbors said several people kept showing up to the house throughout the day and knocking on the door , presumably unaware of the raid . "	i 'm proud to be a detroiter .	this is a great neighborhood , " dorn said . "	but the nicer areas in detroit are shrinking , and we have to do everything we can to save them . "	fighting the squatters , though , was no easy feat .	dorn and several neighbors sought help from the police , the mayor 's office , the utility companies , bank of america , which owned the property , and the real estate agent in charge of selling the house .	for almost two months , residents said , nothing happened .	the squatters were still there , they said , making drug deals on the sidewalk .	of course , the west village association was n't the only one with a squatter complaint . "	it 's not an uncommon complaint that the city receives , given the thousands of abandoned buildings , " said stephen serkaian , a spokesman for mayor dave bing .	police chief ralph godbee jr. said in a statement that police learned of the squatters because of neighborhood concerns .	he also stressed that property owners can help prevent criminals from setting up shop in neighborhoods by securing their residential or commercial properties to keep out squatters . "	we realize that we have thousands of vacant buildings and homes , and some are being illegally occupied with persons participating in criminal activities , " he said in the statement . "	we need the continued assistance of concerned citizens to make our communities safer . "	as dorn eventually learned , only the property owner can evict a squatter ?	police can get involved only if there is proven illegal activity .	that 's where the neighborhood security stepped in .	a security patrol officer videotaped what he said were drug deals in front of the house to prove to police " that something was going on . "	charles caccione , the real estate agent bank of america hired to sell the property , was also frustrated by the situation .	he said he also contacted the police for help .	caccione said that in squatter situations , the property owner ca n't physically force someone out and has to go through a formal eviction process as if the squatter were a real tenant , which can take months . "	meanwhile , they 're tearing the house apart , stealing copper , dealing drugs , " he said . "	it 's a terrible process . "	dorn said he 's glad police finally did act . "	it was a little longer than we would have liked , but we 're happy with the outcome , " he said .	dorn also has advice for other detroiters battling squatter issues : " do n't stop complaining , " he said . "	keep digging .	and contact everyone you can . "

the board of directors of the wyoming lottery corp. received results of the audit by cheyenne-based mcgee , hearne & paiz during a meeting monday .	board chairman mark macy said the lottery seemed to be " right on track or at least not significantly off on how our operations were conducted . "	the audit noted a couple of minor accounting issues that lottery ceo jon clontz said the lottery had pointed out to auditors . "	the fact that we 're still scaling the business from the ground up , and we ca n't use state resources ... i think it 's a remarkable outcome , " clontz said .	some lawmakers have criticized the lottery for not paying any money to cities and counties since it started selling tickets last year .	lottery officials say money will start flowing to cities and counties once about $ 3 million in private startup loans are paid off next year .	the 2013 wyoming legislature set up the lottery as a quasi-government organization run by a board of directors appointed by the governor .	the law specifies that the first $ 6 million in net profits will go to local governments , and anything above that goes to a state school fund .	the law also prohibits instant win scratch tickets , limiting the lottery to draw games .	the first tickets for powerball and mega millions , both national draw games , were sold in the state on aug. 24 , 2014 , and the first in-state cowboy draw game tickets were sold march 15 .	however , lawmakers did not appropriate any state money to start the lottery , forcing the board to take out private loans to get it up and running .	the lottery board decided that the loan should be paid off first before distributing any money to local governments .	in its first year of operation , more than 577,000 players won $ 5.2 million .	the lottery paid out its first million dollar winner on a cowboy draw jackpot in september .	retailers that sell lottery tickets collected more than $ 1 million in commissions during its first year of sales .
the little planes that connect america 's small cities to the rest of the world are slowly being phased out .	airlines are getting rid of these planes ?	their least-efficient ?	in response to the high cost of fuel .	delta , united continental , and other big airlines are expected to park , scrap or sell hundreds of jets with 50 seats or fewer in coming years .	small propeller planes are meeting the same fate .	the loss of those planes is leaving some little cities with fewer flights or no flights at all .	the airports council international says 27 small airports in the continental u.s. , including st. cloud , minn. , and oxnard , calif. , have lost service from well-known commercial airlines over the last two years .	more shutdowns are planned .	travelers in cities that have lost service now must drive or take buses to larger airports .	that adds time and stress to travel .	st. cloud lost air service at the end of 2009 after delta eliminated flights on 34-seat turboprops .	now , passengers from the city of 66,000 have a 90-minute drive to the minneapolis airport 65 miles to the southeast .	roger geraets , who works for an online education company based near st. cloud. , flies at least twice a month from minneapolis .	he used to connect from st. cloud .	now he drives , leaving an extra half hour for bad traffic .	there are other headaches .	parking at st. cloud was free , but in minneapolis it costs $ 14 per day .	and getting through airport security in minneapolis takes longer .	another city without service is oxnard , 60 miles northwest of los angeles , which lost three daily turboprop flights operated on behalf of united .	the airport 's website advises travelers to catch a bus to los angeles international airport .	atilla taluy , a tax preparer who lives in oxnard , ends up driving or taking the shuttle to los angeles . "	in morning traffic , it becomes quite a burdensome trip , " he says .	pierre , s.d. , will lose delta flights to minneapolis in mid-january .	pierre officials are waiting to find out whether those flights will be replaced or whether the city will be left with only great lakes airlines flights to denver .	the denver flights add almost 600 miles in the wrong direction for people who want to fly from south dakota 's capital to washington , d.c. " i do n't know if they really care about ( passengers ) in the small markets , " says rick steece , a consultant for the centers for disease control who travels overseas from pierre two to three times a year .	in the late 1990s , when jet fuel cost one-fourth of today 's prices , the small jets and turboprops were a profitable way for airlines to connect people in small cities to the rest in the world .	the flights attracted business travelers who tended to pay more for tickets .	airlines loved the planes .	bombardier and embraer sold more than 1,900 50-seat jets during the late 1990s and early 2000s . "	we all got carried away with it , " says glen w. hauenstein , delta 's executive vice president for network planning , revenue management and marketing .	then jet fuel prices soared .	they 're at $ 3.16 per gallon today , up from 78 cents in 2000 .	that 's changed the economics of small planes .	for airlines , it all comes down to spreading fuel costs among passengers .	a delta 50-seat crj-200 made by bombardier takes 19 gallons of fuel to fly each passenger 500 miles .	fuel usage drops to just 7.5 gallons per passenger on delta 's 160-seat md-90s over the same distance .	so while the bigger jet burns more fuel overall , it 's more efficient .	delta is moving away from small jets more aggressively than other airlines .	it will eliminate 121 50-seat jets from october 2008 through the end of next year .	that will leave it with 324 .	lynchburg , va. , lost delta 's three daily flights on 50-seat jets earlier this year , although us airways still flies similar jets there .	airport manager mark courtney says delta also served nearby roanoke and charlottesville , va. , each about 60 miles away , so it may have figured its lynchburg customers will drive to those cities to catch a flight .	lynchburg is the home of the 2,000 workers for french nuclear services company areva , and its largest international destination had been paris by way of delta 's atlanta hub , courtney says .	some delta routes served by 50-seaters are getting bigger planes instead .	delta 's atlanta-des moines flights are on larger md-88s , which seat 142 , and it has shifted the mix toward larger planes between atlanta and birmingham , ala. , nashville , and savannah , ga. , too .	united continental holdings inc. still has 354 50-seat jets .	but that number is expected to shrink , said greg hart , the airline 's senior vice president of network .	continental 's effort to get rid of its 37-seat planes shows how eager airlines are to quit flying them .	it has 30 of the jets under lease , some until 2018 .	twenty-five are grounded .	the rest are subleased for $ 6 million less than continental is paying for them .	american eagle , which feeds traffic to its corporate sibling american airlines , owns 39 of the same 37-seaters .	but 17 of them were parked as of the end of last year .	parent company amr corp. had been trying to sell some of those planes in 2009 but could n't get any buyers .	many travelers wo n't miss the small jets .	one of them , tony diaz , is a technology support manager from dallas .	he was changing planes in minneapolis on his way to moline , ill. .	the second leg was a small delta jet . "	the larger planes are definitely better to ride in , " he said , glancing down at his larger-than-average frame .	there 's still a market for larger jets , which allow airlines to spread out fuel costs .	nearly all so-called regional jets sold between 2010 and 2019 are expected to have 51 seats or more ?	with the biggest category being jets with 76 to 130 seats , according to forecast international . "	more of those are going to see the skies , " said aviation consultant mike boyd .	but those aluminum-skinned 50-seaters will be scrapped for parts . "	they 're on their way to the budweiser display . "

a federal court rejected the appeal of a minnesota man convicted of impersonating a lawyer in north dakota , saying in a ruling monday that he misled federal courts across the country into admitting him to practice law .	a three-judge panel of the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals in st. louis upheld the conviction and prison sentence for howard o. kieffer , 55 , of duluth , minn. .	the court said he never obtained a college degree , attended law school or passed a bar exam . "	kieffer is a felon with a history of dishonesty , including convictions for petty and grand theft , passing bad checks , and stealing cable tv , " the appeals court opinion said .	authorities had said kieffer lied on his application to practice law in federal court and worked on federal cases in at least 10 states .	kieffer was charged in north dakota in 2008 after one of his clients , a man accused of child pornography , wrote to a federal judge in bismarck , raising questions about whether kieffer had ever been a licensed attorney .	a bismarck jury convicted kieffer last year on charges of mail fraud and false statements .	he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison and ordered to repay $ 152,750 to clients .	kieffer 's clients included a former st. louis blues hockey player who pleaded guilty to plotting to kill his agent and a colorado woman who was convicted of soliciting the killing of her former husband .	kieffer also was found guilty by a denver jury in april of fraud and making false statements .	he was sentenced last month to an additional four years and nine months in prison and has appealed that conviction to the 10th u.s. circuit court of appeals in denver .	court records show kieffer was convicted of theft and filing false tax returns and served time in a federal prison from 1989 to 1992 .	at kieffer 's trial in bismarck , attorneys testified that they thought kieffer was a colleague because he seemed to know about federal court matters and because they saw him at attorney training seminars .

the sanctions associated with florida 's school grading system will be put on hold for a year under a bill passed wednesday by the florida legislature .	the legislation follows a tumultuous time during which florida 's former education commissioner resigned and critics questioned both the state 's a-to-f grading system and new testing standards being implemented in the state 's public schools .	the move to overhaul the grading system was backed by education commissioner pam stewart and is being made as the state transitions to a new test replacing the florida comprehensive assessment test or fcat .	the florida house passed the bill by a 76-42 vote .	a key portion of the bill ( sb 1642 ) would ensure that schools would n't receive sanctions or penalties as a result of school grades issued in 2015 .	that 's because the state plans to use the first year of the new test as a baseline to measure schools . "	this is a common-sense approach to our accountability system , " said rep. janet adkins , r-fernandina beach , one of the sponsors .	school superintendents had suggested putting the ramifications from the grading system on hold for three years to give more time for school districts to get used to the new test , which will be based primarily on common core state standards .	democratic legislators tried unsuccessfully to adhere to this request , but their efforts were defeated earlier this week by house republicans .	consequently , democrats voted against the bill wednesday . "	we are going to hurt the children by pushing the grades forward without knowing what 's going on , " said rep. mark danish , d-tampa .	florida first instituted the a-to-f grading system 15 years ago under former gov. jeb bush .	schools with high grades are given financial rewards , while sanctions are imposed on chronically low-performing schools .	over the years , the grading formula , which has largely been centered on fcat scores , has been changed and altered to take in different categories for high schools and to measure learning gains of those students who scored at the bottom of the test .	but recent changes to the standards created complaints and confusion .	the state was forced to enact a safety-net provision that prevented school grades from dropping more than one letter grade a year .	florida 's previous education commissioner , tony bennett , resigned last summer following allegations that when he was commissioner in indiana he changed the grade of a charter school run by a major republican donor .	gov. rick scott convened a schools summit in august during which he asked education officials and others to discuss possible changes to the grading system .	the changes approved by legislators would base school grades for elementary and middle schools primarily on standardized tests given in english language arts , math , science and social studies .	high school grades would take into account graduation rates and the percentage of students eligible to earn college and career credit . "	the changes to school grades ensure we are focused on measuring and improving the factors that are most critical to preparing florida 's students for success in college , career and life , " said stewart in a statement .	rep. karen castor dentel , d-maitland , and a public school teacher , criticized the bill because it would continue to have the state rely on what she called the " test-obsessed genie of reform . " "	we are simply trading a one-trick pony for a three-ring circus , " castor dentel said .

"	it would be a culture shock going from a little setting to a larger one , " authement said , adding that the students also would be going from the oldest students on campus to the youngest , increasing the shock .	authement said the group discussed implementing intramural sports at mabel brasher and alma redwine so the sixth-graders have the same opportunities as their counterparts in rapides middle schools .

president barack obama returns to washington this weekend eager to test whether a modest budget deal passed in the waning days of 2013 can spark bipartisan momentum on capitol hill .	as he opens his sixth year in office , he also faces legacy-defining decisions on the future of government surveillance programs and the american-led war in afghanistan .	looming over it all will be the november congressional elections , obama 's last chance to stock congress with more democratic lawmakers who could help him expand his presidential playing field .	for republicans , those contests are an opportunity to seize control of the senate , which would render obama a lame duck for his final two years in the white house .	the wild card in 2014 , for the white house and congressional democrats facing re-election , will be the fate of the president 's health care law .	the website woes that tainted its launch have largely been resolved and enrollment has picked up .	but the white house has been tight-lipped about who has enrolled , raising uncertainty about whether the insurance exchanges are on track to get the percentage of young and healthy people who are critical to keeping the price of insurance coverage down .	the health care questions aside , obama spokesman josh earnest said the white house enters the new year buoyed by the " modest amount of legislative momentum " generated by the december budget deal . "	we 're hopeful congress can build on it and make progress on other priorities where common ground exists , " earnest said .	it wo n't take long to test that proposition , with debates on unemployment insurance , budget spending and the government 's borrowing limit expected in quick succession in the opening weeks of the year .	if all three can be resolved in drama-free fashion ?	by washington standards , of course ?	the white house believes it could create a more favorable atmosphere for obama to pursue second-term priorities such as an immigration overhaul and a higher minimum wage , though both would still face steep odds .	the president is scheduled to arrive in washington on sunday morning after an overnight flight from his home state of hawaii .	he 's spent two quiet weeks on the island of oahu golfing and spending time with his family and childhood friends .	upon his return , obama will step back quickly into the debate over expired long-term unemployment benefits for 1.3 million americans .	senate majority leader harry reid has scheduled a vote monday night on a bill that would reinstate the benefits for three months .	obama will try to make his case the following day , holding a white house event with some of those whose benefits expired at the end of december . "	for decades , republicans and democrats put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job-seekers , even when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today , " obama said in his weekly radio and internet address . "	instead of punishing families who can least afford it , republicans should make it their new year 's resolution to do the right thing and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now . "	the issue with the greatest potential to upset the tepid truce forged in december 's budget deal is the debt ceiling .	as part of the agreement that ended the 16-day partial government shutdown in october , congress suspended the $ 16 trillion-plus debt limit .	treasury secretary jacob lew says bookkeeping maneuvers he can use to keep under that ceiling will last only until late february or early march .	obama once again has pledged that he wo n't negotiate on the matter .	house republicans will plot their strategy at a caucus retreat later this month .	aside from fiscal matters , the president also must make decisions on what changes he wants in the government 's vast surveillance powers .	he 's expected to announce those changes before his jan. 28 state of the union policy address , though an exact date has not been set .	a presidential commission presented obama with more than 40 recommendations and the president signaled at a year-end news conference that he was open to many of the proposals .	but he 's facing pushback from his intelligence advisers , who argue that the widespread collection of telephone and internet records is crucial to national security .	the president also must make a decision on the future of the american force presence in afghanistan .	afghan president hamid karzai is yet to sign a bilateral security agreement with the u.s. that the obama administration says is crucial if american troops are to stay in the country after the war formally concludes at the end of 2014 .	the white house had hoped to have the agreement signed before jan. 1 , but indicated there was some flexibility on that timing .	officials say that without an agreement soon , the u.s. will be forced to start making plans to bring all of its troops home . "	we are talking about weeks , not months , left on the clock , " said caitlin hayden , obama 's national security council spokeswoman .	aides say january 's packed agenda will keep the president in washington for much of the lead up to his nationally televised state of the union address to both houses of congress , though some brief domestic travel may occur .
dense smoke from a wildfire burning in and around yosemite national park on saturday hampered both suppression efforts and the prized views sought by holiday weekend tourists .	for the first time since the blaze broke out in a neighboring forest two weeks ago , smoke obscured yosemite valley , home to the california park 's most popular landmarks , spokeswoman kari cobb said . "	i 'm in yosemite valley right now , and i can not see the cliffs around me , " cobb said . "	the wind has shifted and smoke is impacting the entire park .	we have been lucky until now . "	all the campgrounds in the valley still were full as of saturday morning , despite the thick blanket and burning smell that permeated the area , she said .	as a health precaution , visitors were being asked to scale back their outdoor recreation plans and avoid strenuous activities or even stay indoors .	meanwhile , firefighting aircraft remained grounded because of low visibility caused by the smoke , u.s. forest service spokesman mark healey said .	the blaze had scorched 343 square miles ( 888 square kilometers ) of brush , oaks and pines and 11 homes , as of saturday .	of that total , 94 square miles ( 243 square kilometers ) of wilderness have burned in the northern section of yosemite , up from 75 square miles ( 194 square kilometers ) a day earlier .	although containment efforts proceeded on a positive note overnight , officials were concerned saturday about a 150-acre ( 60-hectare ) spot fire that crossed a road and prompted an evacuation order for homes near the west entrance of yosemite , healey said .	once planes and water-dropping helicopters were cleared to take off again , the worry lifted some along with the evacuation order . "	air operations are going full-blast to bring this fire under control , " healey said late saturday afternoon healey said fresh firefighters were being brought in to replace tired crews , but that officials did not plan to reduce the nearly 5,000 people assigned to the fire .	the blaze 's cause is under investigation .
an unmuzzled rod blagojevich launched the campaign of his life thursday , taking the witness stand at his corruption trial in an attempt to win over a jury that will decide , among other things , if he tried to sell or trade president barack obama 's old senate seat for personal gain .	looking directly at the jurors who will decide his fate , blagojevich tried to connect with them by laying out nearly every detail of his biography : his upbringing , his first job , the insecurity of his college years .	he described himself as a flawed dreamer grounded in his parents ' working-class values and at one point choked up as he talked about the day he met his wife , patti .	not until five hours into his testimony did blagojevich and his attorneys begin to address the 20 charges of corruption against him .	on the first of what could be several days on the stand , he was not asked about the obama senate seat allegation .	but he denied other charges , saying he never tried to leverage a state school grant to squeeze rahm emanuel 's brother , a hollywood agent , to hold a fundraiser for him .	he also denied trying to shake down a racetrack owner .	and he denied a damning allegation made in testimony the previous day when rep. jesse jackson accused him of withholding a state job for jackson 's wife at least partly because jackson had refused to give him a $ 25,000 campaign donation . "	i do n't remember anything remotely like that , " blagojevich said .	indignant one minute , laughing the next , in tears after that , witness blagojevich clearly was trying to humanize himself for the jury to counteract the blunt , profane , seemingly greedy blagojevich heard on fbi wiretap recordings played in court by prosecutors over the last several weeks .	as a legal strategy , he may also have been attempting to demonstrate his penchant for endless talk .	that would help lay the groundwork for his attorneys ' argument that blagojevich 's long discussions with aides about fundraising and getting a top job for himself or his wife were just a politician 's unceasing ramblings .	that , legal experts say , could offset the enormous gamble of having blagojevich testify , which will expose him to withering cross examination by prosecutors in the days to come . "	they see him tell about his life .	they see him cry .	it makes ( the jury ) think that this is not the type of person who should be convicted of these things , ( but ) as a decent guy who maybe made some mistakes , " said joel levin , a former federal prosecutor who helped convict former illinois gov. george ryan of corruption . "	they see him as a human being instead of this anonymous figure . " "	every case where the defendant testified , the case rises and falls on the testimony of the defendant , " levin said . "	to a large extent , the jury sets aside the other evidence and focuses on the defendant .	now it 's just , ' is this guy telling us the truth ? ' "	if convicted on all 20 counts , blagojevich faces a maximum prison term of 350 years .	federal guidelines would dictate he get far less , though judges can consider multiple factors in sentencing , including whether the defendant took the stand and lied .	putting a defendant on the stand is always considered highly risky ?	in part because it opens the person to intense cross-examination later .	but blagojevich 's defense clearly hoped the former governor 's political skills and personal charm would help counteract the government 's three-week case .	a jury deadlocked on most charges after blagojevich 's first trial last year , when defense attorneys rested without calling a single witness .	for months before that trial , blagojevich had insisted he would take the stand , then declined to do so .	the 54-year-old former governor 's demeanor shifted several times over the course of the day .	he initially appeared nervous , then became increasingly confident as he went off on tangents about decades-old boxing matches and historical events , then turned subdued again as questioning turned away from the personal to the professional .	while he could remember in minute detail the night that he met his wife , patti , in 1988 , or the first time he saw ryne sandberg play for the cubs years ago , his recollection of details about his more recent dealings as governor were far fuzzier , and he began saying " i do n't remember " more often .	at one point , he offered an apology to jurors , who had listened to his famously profane tirades caught on fbi wiretaps that form the heart of the government 's case . "	i 'd like to apologize to the men and women for those words ... when you hear them , it makes you wince , " he told jurors . "	when i hear myself swearing like that , i am an f-ing jerk . "	blagojevich described his love of basketball , his job as a shoeshine boy and how his father left the family at one point to work on the alaskan oil pipeline .	another time , he even recited poetry .	prosecutors objected only twice before midday , otherwise allowing blagojevich to meander far from the accusations for which he is on trial , likely aware that too much objection to the defendants ' own testimony may make jurors think they are trying to stop him from telling his side .	but by the afternoon , their patience had clearly run out .	assistant u.s. attorney reid schar stood up to object at least 30 times , whenever blagojevich began an off-topic ramble .	jurors also appeared to grow weary .	by the afternoon , their eyes left the witness stand and roamed the courtroom more often .	they tuned back in during blagojevich 's repeated denials of wrongdoing , though , furiously taking notes each time he answered " no " to a question about whether he had committed any crimes .	blagojevich spoke in detail about how his serbian immigrant father had fought the nazis during world war ii .	asked how his family background influenced him , he said , " it gives you a certain sense of values and people needing help .	... i picked up my dad 's propensity to dream . "	he also told jurors he often felt inferior compared with other students during his time at northwestern university , going into detail about dressing in 1970s disco style at the time ?	while other kids wore preppy shirts " with alligators . " "	a lot of what i am , deep down , there are a lot of insecurities , " he said . "	that can drive you ... and also have petty sides , flaws , fears . "	another time , in talking about his fondness for jogging , he said , " i have a vain quality ... a certain narcissism . "	blagojevich became most emotional as he pointed across the room and began to talk about the day that he met his wife , patti , who sat with tears streaming down her cheeks .	when blagojevich stopped and appeared overcome , the judge ordered a break .

several local groups held a town hall meeting in flint to inform residents about a recent injunction regarding the city 's troubled water supply .	more than 100 residents attended the meeting thursday night at the vernon chapel ame church in flint .	it was organized by councilman eric mays , the concerned pastors for social action , the coalition for clean water and other groups .	attorney val washington , who 's suing the city over its water rates and policies , spoke to the crowd and explained what the preliminary injunction means to them as water customers .	a judge has ordered the city of flint to roll back water and sewer rates by 35 percent , to end a ready-to-service fee , to repay its water and sewer fund by more than $ 15 million , and to stop water disconnections and liens for past-due bills effective aug. 7 , the day the preliminary injunction was signed , washington explained to the crowd .	washington said a hearing will be held monday to determine whether the case will become a class action lawsuit , the flint journal ( http://bit.ly/1kpb39a ) reported . "	monday is significant because any time you file a case that you 're calling a class action it 's not a class action until the judge says it 's a class action by signing an order that certifies that there 's a class of people who have been affected by the conduct that you 're suing over .	that 's the significance of monday , " he said , adding that he encourages residents to attend the hearing .	if the judge does n't sign the order on monday , only two clients will be involved in the lawsuit as opposed to thousands , washington said .	at the meeting on thursday , the concerned pastors for social action announced plans to give away 1,500 water filters to flint residents on tuesday .	the city has been in violation of the safe drinking water act since the beginning of this year because of elevated levels of total trihalomethanes in water samples .	since last april , when the city started using the flint river as its water source , some residents have complained about the smell , taste and appearance of their water .	city officials said this week that they 're lowering bills effective immediately to comply with the judge 's ruling .
the shooting suspect who went on a deadly rampage inside a colorado theater planned the attack with " calculation and deliberation , " police said , receiving deliveries for months which authorities believe armed him for battle and were used to rig his apartment with dozens of bombs .	authorities on saturday removed dangerous explosive materials from inside james holmes ' suburban denver apartment a day after police said he opened fire and set off gas canisters in a suburban theater minutes into the premiere of the batman film " the dark knight rises . "	the attack left 12 people dead and 58 injured .	his apartment was rigged with jars of liquids , explosives and chemicals that were booby trapped to kill " whoever entered it , " aurora police chief dan oates said , noting it would have likely been one of his officers .	all hazards have been removed from the holmes ' apartment and residents in surrounding buildings can return home , police said .	the exception was holmes ' apartment building , where authorities were still collecting evidence .	inside the apartment , authorities began covering the windows with black plastic to prevent onlookers from seeing in .	before they did , a man in an atf t-shirt could be seen measuring a poster on a closet that advertised a dvd called " soldiers of misfortune . "	the poster showed several figures in various positions playing paintball , some wearing masks .	authorities would n't discuss a motive for one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent u.s. history , as makeshift memorials for the victims sprang up and relatives began to publicly mourn their loved ones .	holmes had recently withdrawn from a competitive graduate program in neuroscience at the university of colorado-denver , where he was one of six students at the school to get national institutes of health grant money .	he recently took an intense three-part , oral exam that marks the end of the freshman year of the four-year program there , but university officials would not say if he passed , citing privacy concerns .	in a resume posted on monster.com , holmes listed himself as an " aspiring scientist " and said he was looking for a job as a laboratory technician .	the resume , first obtained by the press-enterprise in riverside , paints a picture of a brilliant young man brimming with potential : he worked as a summer intern at the salk institute for biological studies in la jolla in 2006 and mapped the neurons of zebra finches and studied the flight muscles of hummingbirds while an undergraduate at the university of california , riverside .	he also worked as a summer camp counselor to underprivileged children at a jewish camp in los angeles in 2008 .	still , neighbors and former classmates in california said although holmes was whip-smart , he was a loner who said little and was easily forgotten ?	until this week .	holmes apparently had prepared the attack at the aurora theater well in advance , receiving multiple deliveries by mail for four months to his home and school and buying thousands of rounds of ammunition on the internet , oates said . "	he had a high volume of deliveries , " oates said . "	we think this explains how he got his hands on the magazine , ammunition , " he said , as well as the rigged explosives in his apartment . "	what we 're seeing here is evidence of some calculation and deliberation , " oates added .	federal authorities detonated one small explosive and disarmed others inside holmes ' apartment after sending in a robot to take down a trip wire , fbi special agent james yacone said .	bomb technicians then neutralized what he called a " hypergolic mixture " and an improvised explosive device containing an unknown substance .	there also were multiple containers of accelerants , he said . "	it was an extremely dangerous environment , " yacone said , saying anyone who walked in would have sustained " significant injuries " or been killed .	outside the apartment , police arranged plastic storage boxes and large white plastic bags , possibly for evidence , although no officials were available to confirm the purpose of the containers .	holmes , 24 , was in solitary confinement for his protection at a county detention facility saturday , held without bond on suspicion of multiple counts of first-degree murder .	he was set for an initial hearing on monday and had been appointed a public defender , authorities said .	stories of the dead began to emerge , including that of a 6-year-old girl and a man who died on his 27th birthday and a day before his anniversary .	families grieved and waited at hospitals , which reported at least seven wounded still in critical condition saturday and others with injuries that likely are permanent .	veronica moser , 6 , had gone to the movies with her mother , who was drifting in and out of consciousness in a hospital intensive care unit , bullets lodged in her throat and a gunshot wound to her abdomen . "	nobody can tell her about it , " annie dalton said of her niece , ashley moser . "	she is in critical condition , but all she 's asking about is her daughter . "	veronica had just started swimming lessons on tuesday , dalton said . "	she was excited about life as she should be .	she 's a 6-year-old girl , " her great aunt said .	another victim , 27-year-old matt mcquinn , was killed after diving in front of his girlfriend and her older brother to shield them from the gunfire , said his family 's attorney , rob scott of dayton , ohio .	alex sullivan had planned a weekend of fun , first ringing in his 27th birthday with friends at the special midnight showing of " the dark knight rises " and then celebrating his first wedding anniversary on sunday . "	he was a very , very good young man , " said sullivan 's uncle , joe loewenguth . "	he always had a smile , always made you laugh .	he had a little bit of comic in him . "	president barack obama , who called in his weekly radio address for prayer and reflection on the rampage , was scheduled to travel to colorado on sunday to visit with the families of victims .	oates said holmes used a military-style semi-automatic rifle , a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on the unsuspecting theater-goers .	he had bought the weapons at local gun stores within the last two months .	he recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the internet , the chief said .	holmes also bought an urban assault vest , two magazine holders and a knife for just over $ 300 on july 2 from an online supplier of tactical gear for police and military personnel , according to the company .	chad weinman , ceo of tacticalgear.com , said his company processes thousands of orders each day , and there was nothing unusual in the one that holmes placed . "	everything mr. holmes purchased on july 2 is commercially available , " weinman said , adding he was " appalled " that the material was sold to holmes before the shooting .	the batman movie , the last in the trilogy starring christian bale , opened worldwide friday with midnight showings in the u.s. " the dark knight rises " earned $ 30.6 million in friday morning midnight screenings , and , according to industry estimates , roughly $ 75 to 77 million on that day .	that put it on track for a weekend total of around $ 165 million , which would be the second-highest opening weekend ever , following " the avengers . "	after buying a ticket to the movie , holmes went into the theater and propped open an exit door several minutes into the film , a federal law enforcement official said .	the suspect then returned in protective gear and with high-powered weapons and opened fire , shooting scores of people and picking off victims who tried to flee , officials said .	the shooting was the worst in the u.s. since the nov. 5 , 2009 , attack at fort hood , texas .	an army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others .	associated press contributors to this report include kristen wyatt , steven k. paulson , ivan moreno , p. solomon banda in aurora ; dan elliott , nick riccardi and colleen slevin in denver ; gillian flaccus in aurora , colo ; ap entertainment writer jake coyle in new york ; m.l. johnson in chicago .	brian skoloff in salt lake city ; monika mathur and jennifer farrar at news research center in new york ; and alicia a. caldwell and eileen sullivan in washington .
the new youtube kids mobile app targets young children with unfair and deceptive advertising and should be investigated , a group of consumer advocates told the u.s. federal trade commission in a letter tuesday .	google introduced the app in february as a " safer " place for kids to explore videos because it was restricted to " family-focused content . "	but the consumer activists say the app is so stuffed with advertisements and product placements that it 's hard to tell the difference between entertainment and commercials .	one example is a 7-minute video of disney 's " frozen " characters who appear as dolls inside a toy mcdonald 's , eating ice cream and drinking sprite .	the activists say digital media should be subject to the same rules as television , which limits commercial content on kids ' programming . "	as a consumer , you should have the right to know who is trying to persuade you , " said angela campbell with the institute for public representation at georgetown law , who provided legal counsel to the coalition .	in young children especially , " it takes unfair advantage of their trusting nature and lack of experience , " she added .	in a statement early tuesday , youtube said : " we worked with numerous partners and child advocacy groups when developing youtube kids .	while we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app , we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions , including the suggestion that no free , ad-supported experience for kids will ever be acceptable .	we disagree and think that great content should n't be reserved for only those families who can afford it . "	since its inception in 2005 , youtube has become the world 's most popular online video site , with more than 1 billion users .	for parents , it 's become an easy way to find elmo song clips or full episodes of " barney & friends . "	but when searching for elmo or barney , it 's easy to pull up other user-generated content aimed at adults , such as the two puppets cursing or waving guns .

michigan voters , whose state economy began declining earlier and sank deeper than almost any other in the nation , turned tuesday to a republican businessman for their next governor , selecting a political outsider who vowed to bring jobs .	rick snyder easily beat democrat virg bernero , the mayor of lansing , after being ahead in the polls since the august primary .	with 48 percent of precincts reporting , snyder had 60 percent of the vote to bernero 's 37 percent , according to unofficial returns tabulated by the associated press .	it was the first governor 's race without an incumbent in eight years .	democratic gov. jennifer granholm could not run again because of term limits .	it was also the first statewide election since the bankruptcy reorganization of two of michigan 's biggest employers , general motors co. and chrysler group llc .	snyder , the former president of computer maker gateway inc. , kicked off his campaign with a super bowl ad in which he declared himself " one tough nerd . "	bernero fought to stage a surprise win with his pro-middle class , pro-worker agenda .	eric toelle , 35 , of the detroit suburb of st. clair shores , said he was a " die-hard democrat " who voted for president barack obama and granholm .	but this time he went for snyder . "	let me put it this way : if you 're going to build a house , show me the blueprints .	you do n't need to tell me how bad the bricks are , " toelle said . "	it 's no secret we are in a horrible economy .	bernero did n't show me the blueprint . "	snyder squeezed past four more conservative gop politicians in the august primary by appealing to moderates , and polls consistently showed him about 20 points ahead of bernero .	still , bernero sought to stage an upset and campaigned with former president bill clinton in detroit less than two weeks before the election .	snyder 's steady drumbeat of ads highlighted his success in helping launch startup companies in emerging fields and his status as a political outsider .	he vowed to rely on that experience to ease the state 's economic woes .	michigan 's 13.1 percent unemployment rate is well above the national average and has been among the highest in the u.s. for several years .	bernero pitched himself as a mayor who has brought jobs and " cranes in the air " to his community while trimming the budget by millions of dollars .	the man described as the " angry mayor " talked about his 84-year-old father , a retired autoworker , and vehemently defended autoworkers as gm and chrysler descended into bankruptcy .	he acknowledged defeat in a speech at a downtown detroit casino hotel . "	it was a fight , my friends , worth fighting , but it was n't our time , " said bernero , surrounded by his wife , two daughters and running mate , southfield mayor brenda lawrence .	jennifer cox , 37 , a bank teller from lansing , said she voted for bernero because of his track record in lansing . "	i like what he 's done with the city so far .	he 's got a proven record .	we need more industry in the state and he 's willing to fight for that .	he 's really fought for what the people want . "	snyder joined gateway when it was a fledgling computer maker in 1991 , becoming president and chief operating officer in january 1996 before leaving management in august 1997 .	he remained on gateway 's board of directors until the company was sold to taiwan-based acer inc. in 2007 , returning for seven months in 2006 as interim ceo .	he has only a short time to craft a budget proposal for the state .	the nonpartisan senate fiscal agency says michigan faces a $ 1 billion shortfall in the budget year that starts next oct. 1 .	the nonpartisan citizens research council puts the deficit even higher , at $ 1.5 billion .

the failure of a reactor coolant valve at the tennessee valley authority 's browns ferry nuclear plant months ago has raised questions about apparent violations of nuclear regulatory commission requirements .	nrc atlanta region spokesman joey ledford said thursday that the valve was stuck shut .	although there is a separate reactor cooling system , there are scenarios when " this particular system would need to be operable , " he said .	an nrc statement said tva has been called to a monday meeting in atlanta to explain the safety significance of the valve failure that tva and the nrc discovered last fall during a shutdown of the unit 1 reactor at the browns ferry plant near athens , ala. .	the statement said the valve " would have been unable to fulfill its safety function if it had been needed . "	david lochbaum , nuclear program director for the union of concerned scientists , said thursday that for most accidents the valve problem was inconsequential but not in a fire . "	had there been a fire at the plant there would have been an inability to cool the core , " lochbaum said in a telephone interview . "	had there been a fire , the fire would have taken out all the backups . "	lochbaum , who previously worked at the browns ferry plant and last week testified before congressional panels about the industry , said the valve failure was not tva 's fault but was due to testing procedures used at all nuclear plants .	he said the testing method used to show that the valve is not working correctly will change . "	it is something tva will do different and probably everybody else will do differently , " lochbaum said .	tva nuclear spokesman ray golden said thursday that the mechanical problem at browns ferry was discovered , repaired and reported during a unit 1 refueling shutdown at the three-reactor plant and was never a safety threat .	golden said there are separate reactor cooling systems .	he said the valve that circulates cooling water in and out of the reactor was " sort of stuck in the closed position . "	golden said the valve failure could result in increased nrc oversight at tva 's ' historically problem-plagued plant .	ledford said the monday meeting would give the nrc " an opportunity to get their side of what happened . "	he said the nrc would issue a response within a few weeks of the meeting .	ledford said the nrc does n't regularly impose civil penalties on nuclear plant operators , but the cost of any increase in nrc inspections is paid by the operator .	the nrc statement said the meeting is to discuss " apparent violations of nrc requirements linked to the failure of a low pressure coolant injection valve . "	ledford said the monday meeting about the valve failure is not related to the nrc 's review of all nuclear plants following the nuclear emergency in japan .	golden said past problems at the browns ferry plant have at times led to extra nrc scrutiny .	the plant is internationally known in the industry as the site where a worker using a candle to check for air leaks in 1974 started a fire that disabled safety systems .	tva had allowed a recent media tour at the plant , which has a reactor design similar to the reactors in japan that malfunctioned after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami .	tva has said the browns ferry plant was designed to withstand a 6.0-magnitude quake .	the knoxville-based utility 's nuclear plants in tennessee ?	watts bar at spring city and sequoyah at soddy-daisy ?	are designed to withstand a 5.8-magnitude quake .	tva , the country 's largest public utility , supplies power to about 9 million people in tennessee , alabama , mississippi , kentucky , georgia , north carolina and virginia .

nordstrom inc. said thursday its first-quarter net income fell 3 percent , hurt by weak demand for spring merchandise and softer performance .	the results were below wall street estimates , a rare miss for the luxury retailer given that higher-end spenders have generally kept shopping in the lackluster economy .	the company 's stock fell more than 3 percent in aftermarket trading .	nordstrom said it had lower sales trends in seasonal products , as well as in the northeast , mid-atlantic and the midwest states during the first two months of the year .	results improved in april .	lower-than-planned sales were offset by tightened control over inventory and expenses .	the seattle-based retailer said net income fell to $ 145 million , or 73 cents per share .	that compares with net income of $ 149 million , or 70 cents per share a year ago .	analysts expected net income of 76 cents per share .	revenue rose 5 percent to $ 2.75 billion .	analysts expected $ 2.81 billion .	revenue in stores open at least one year rose 2.7 percent .	the measure is a key gauge of a retailer 's financial health because it excludes stores that have opened or closed during the year .	top performing categories included makeup , women 's clothing and purses .	the company now expects full-year sales to rise 4 to 6 percent from a prior range of 4.5 to 6.5 percent .	that implies revenue of $ 12.63 billion to $ 12.89 billion .	analysts expect $ 12.85 billion .	it reiterated full-year net-income guidance of $ 3.65 to $ 3.80 per share , however .	analysts expect $ 3.80 per share .	the company issued its results after the close of trading on wall street and its stock fell $ 1.98 to $ 59.15 in aftermarket dealings .	it had ended the regular trading session day down 31 cents at $ 61.13 .	that 's still near the high end of the stock 's 52-week range of $ 46.27 to $ 61.81 .
connie douthitt got tired of complaining about her knees and sitting on the couch .	then the 52-year-old administrative assistant from lexington was invited to be part of a facebook group , personal challenges , and " those women got me up and motivated . "	the online support group also helped douthitt track down multiple free exercise options .	since then , douthitt told the lexington herald-leader , she has lost 25 pounds and is pleased with the way she feels . "	i think i do a better job day to day at my work , " said douthitt . "	i feel more confident and more energized . "	her online support group has been a key , she said .	when she is having a bad day and posts something about it , it 's not uncommon for her to get 20 or 30 comments of encouragement from the people who are part of the invitation-only network . "	they just say , ' you can do this ' or ' you are not by yourself , ' " she said .	douthitt started out slowly with her exercise regimen by walking in area parks .	she was a little nervous when she took the next step and went to an organized exercise class , a zumba dance class . "	i was thinking , ' there are all these young girls in there , and i am too old to do that , ' " she said .	douthitt took to the class , working her way up to four-times a week and adding spinning classes for good measure .	she soon enticed her daughter , 30-year-old danielle jones , and granddaughter , 3 ?	- year-old jaelynn jones , to join her for zumba classes .	and she 's done at a minimal cost .	douthitt found free classes through referrals from her support group and by searching for classes online .	she takes zumba for free at the kenwick and gainesway community centers and found $ 5 spinning classes at revolution fitness . "	i never knew these things were out here , " she said .	now douthitt encourages other coach potatoes to get moving . "	do n't whine about it , do something about it , " she said . "	the only way to fail is not to try . "
a campaign finance advocacy group is asking north carolina secretary of state elaine marshall to investigate the lobbying ties of gov. pat mccrory and a member of his cabinet .	a letter sent friday to marshall by democracy north carolina executive director bob hall recounts news reports from the associated press about the business relationship between sweepstakes games operators and moore & van allen , a charlotte law and lobbying firm where mccrory worked until just days before taking office .	the firm 's lobbying clients also made political donations to mccrory 's gubernatorial campaign .	a mccrory spokeswoman had no comment friday .	the letter also references stories by the news & observer of raleigh about public safety secretary kieran shanahan 's continued representation of clients at his law firm after joining state government and his wife 's role as a registered lobbyist working out of the same raleigh office .	in the wake of the n&o reports , shanahan announced he would stop advising private clients , though he has not disclosed whom he was working for or how much he was paid .	lobbying activities in the state are regulated by marshall , a democrat .	mccrory and shanahan are republicans .	marshall 's spokeswoman , liz proctor , said lawyers at the agency will review hall 's letter to determine what may fall under the secretary of state 's jurisdiction .	hall filed an earlier complaint with the n.c. board of elections , which is investigating $ 235,000 in campaign donations to mccrory and dozens of others by chase burns , an oklahoma sweepstakes operator who is under indictment on felony charges in florida .	much of the money was distributed to the political campaigns by lobbyists at moore & van allen .
shoe marketer wolverine worldwide inc. said monday that its net income fell 13 percent in the first-quarter as sales were hurt by a recessionary climate in the critical european market .	the company , which makes hush puppies , merrell and other brands , said it earned $ 31.2 million , or 64 cents per share , for the three months ended march 24 , up from $ 35.9 million , or 72 cents per share , in the year-ago period .	analysts on average expected earnings of 55 cents per share , according to factset .	revenue fell to $ 322.8 million from $ 330.9 million .	the company noted that revenue in last year 's quarter had grown by 16 percent .	analysts expected higher revenue of $ 332.6 million .	selling , general and administrative expenses rose to $ 95.2 million from $ 88.3 million a year ago .	wolverine said increased pension expenses and one-time costs in work force reductions contributed to the increase .	the company also repurchased about 65,000 shares in the quarter for a total cost of $ 2.4 million .	ceo blake krueger said the company expects 2012 to a record year , but with most of the growth planned for the second half of the year .	the company raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $ 2.70 to $ 2.80 , from the previous guidance of $ 2.60 and $ 2.70 per share .	adjusted earnings are expected between $ 2.75 and $ 2.85 per share .	analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of $ 2.64 per share .	it expects revenue of $ 1.46 billion to $ 1.50 billion .	analysts expect revenue of $ 1.5 billion .	shares of wolverine , based in rockford , mich. , fell $ 1.27 , or 3.4 percent , to $ 36.62 per share in afternoon trading .	its shares have traded in a 52-week range of $ 30.77 to $ 43.36 .

harvey kirk had a good spot , snug in an upholstered chair in the sun-drenched first floor of the madison central library , his gear piled up at his feet , and a lunchtime cup of instant noodles in hand .	you 'll find him at the library most days ?	even when the temperature is not below zero ?	after he walks the few blocks from the men 's drop-in shelter at grace episcopal church where he sleeps .	the library remains one of the few places for madison homeless people to go in the daytime , says kirk , 65 .	he prefers it over a popular day services program at bethel lutheran church because it is less crowded , he says . "	sometimes you like to get away from the crowd , " says kirk .	plans by dane county to open a day resource center for the homeless and provide a place to go were stymied by a zoning dispute with the town of madison , where the facility the county proposes to renovate is located .	the two governmental bodies now are in court over it .	kirk is one of about 50 homeless people using the central library at any one time , executive director greg mickells told the capital times ( http://bit.ly/1bqhamz ) .	the $ 30 million renovated central library , opened in fall 2013 , has twice the public space as it used to , which means homeless people can be found in various open and alcove spaces on three floors .	the clustering of homeless people with their gear is not as apparent to other casual visitors .	mickells recalls a remark made recently by the mayor of the city of appleton , who visited the madison central library with his city 's library director as they prepared for their own library expansion . "	as we walked through the building , he said he was surprised . '	i was expecting more homeless people , ' he said , " mickells says . "	well , they are here , " mickells says . "	but the way that the building is designed ?	and because we have a behavior policy and monitor the situation ?	we can make it a welcoming place for everyone . "	mickells says he occasionally hears about someone having an outburst , " but i 'm not hearing people say ' we 're scared to go into your building . ' "	concerns that homeless people congregating outside the library , and their sometimes volatile behavior inside , were scaring people off from using the library were important considerations in the design of the renovated library .	hiring an expanded , in-house crew of security monitors also was a calculated decision , mickells says .	instead of contracting for security services as in the past , the library is now hiring security workers directly , which allows the city to better control hiring screening and the level of " customer service " provided to everyone who uses the library .	as a homeless man talked with a reporter in a study carrel on the second floor of the central library , a walkie-talkie equipped security monitor came by and matter-of-factly reminded the pair that the second floor is a quiet space and the first floor is the area where people are allowed to hold extended conversations .	referrals to housing , employment , medical and other services were provided at the central library through a local nonprofit agency last year .	the joint city of madison-dane county funding for that expired this summer , and the library relied on volunteer help until the city issued a $ 65,000 contract in december to hire two case managers , mickells says .	the workers from porchlight inc. will direct homeless people to needed services , as do outreach workers from several local agencies who also serve the homeless that regularly use meeting space at the library .	james gullet checked in with one of those visiting outreach workers about paying off an overdue utility bill so that he can get final approval for an apartment .	he has been looking for a while . "	why is it so hard for senior citizens to get into housing ? "	asked gullet , 63 .	the outreach worker gave gullet two bus passes to go to the utility customer service office , encouraging him to get started on a payment plan today . "	they 're not going to hold that apartment forever , " he cautioned gullet .	gullet , also says he often spends the day at library because he enjoys the reading materials .	he is familiar with the hospitality house day program that porchlight runs at a facility on martin street in the town of madison , but he does n't use it .	dane county is attempting to purchase the facility , located just off fish hatchery road . "	i never go to hospitality house , " gullet says , claiming that the facility smells bad and is too small and crowded . "	it 's full of folks not trying to do anything .	that does n't do anything for me . "	robert britton , 48 , has had a stretch of bad luck with workplace injuries , as well as some personal setbacks , and now is trying to get workers compensation from a former employer , he says .	distressed over the health , legal and housing challenges confronting him , britton says he was not aware that he could talk with someone at the library about making connections for help with those or other issues . "	i 'm doing what everybody is doing here ?	staying warm , " britton says .	kirk , who calmly explains that he became homeless after a series of events he had no control over , recites where to find free meals in madison and is eager to share a brochure listing the sites produced and distributed by local churches .	a former commercial baker , kirk says he collects social security and is on a waiting list for public housing , but the list is two years long . "	if i do n't find anything , i may go to another town where the situation is more advantageous for subsidized housing , " he says .	he was living in rockford , illinois , when he became homeless and went to the local library and searched online for information about homeless services , he says .	he found a lot of articles about occupy madison , the economic equity protest turned homeless encampment that became a nonprofit organization now developing a village of tiny houses for the homeless on the east side . "	i bought a van galder bus ticket and that 's how i got here , " he said .
dr. rami boutros often notices when , as a patient , he walks through a clinic staff area on his way to an exam room and sees doctors and nurses busy working or discussing patients . "	as a patient i 've walked many times next to people and i wonder ' what 's going on , ' ? "	he said . "	there is a lot of commotion , often talk about patients or cases . "	that 's the kind of behind-the-scenes activity that will be , essentially , hidden from patient view at the university of iowa 's new iowa river landing clinic , opening oct. 8 in coralville , boutros said .	the nearly $ 72 million clinic was designed to use the " onstage/offstage " concept of customer service , one of the main ideas learned by ui hospitals and clinics staff during training in recent years with the disney institute , the professional development arm of the walt disney company .	the institute offers training on corporate culture change and customer service , and ui officials have said disney is well-known in the industry for its excellent customer service .	when deciding to incorporate the onstage/offstage concept , ui health care officials also looked to other hospitals around the country that use the concept , and decided it offers benefits in patient privacy and boosting staff work flow , said boutros , executive medical director of off-site ambulatory care programs for ui hospitals and clinics .	the onstage portion describes the areas where patients are ?	entrances , lobbies , waiting areas , elevators , hallways and exam rooms ?	while offstage describes areas where staff work and enter and exit the building or staff areas .	at the new iowa river landing clinic , the patient enters the exam room through a door that connects the room with the patient hallway .	doctors and nurses enter through a second door on the opposite side of the room , which connects it to the offstage work area that patients do n't see or walk through , boutros said last week during a day of employee tours at the new clinic .	so patients are never ushered through a busy hallway or work area where there are supplies , files and computers , where doctors and nurses are working or perhaps talking about another patient , he said . "	so basically , as a patient , i do n't need to worry about what you 're doing and how many people are standing and working on the computer , " he said . "	i want to get into the room , get my exam and leave .	all that other stuff we do , you do n't probably care about as a patient . "	the purpose is for the main focus to be on the patient during each interaction , in an effort to make the experience better , boutros said .	the design should offer benefits to both patients and staff , said cynthia heaton , assistant nurse manager at iowa river landing , which will offer outpatient services in numerous primary care and specialty areas , including internal medicine , pediatrics , cardiology , dermatology and women 's health . "	so for patients , they do n't need to see us coming in for work with our lunch bags , they do n't need to see us discussing what 's going on with a patient .	all they see is the beautiful entrance , they come into the exam room , see the physician and leave , " she said . "	they do n't see the hubbub of what happens , all they get is the result of what happens . "	staff will feel like they can talk more freely about cases knowing patients are not coming and going through the work area , heaton said , and that hopefully will enhance communication and the team approach to patient care .	often in other facilities , clinic staff has been " shoehorned in to previous construction , " said dr. george phillips , in the general pediatrics department .	iowa river landing has a great layout of space that will help boost the energy and work , he said . "	here it 's really been thought-out about how to minimize the time between where is my computer , where 's my dashboard where i can see where my patients are , where 's my room , where 's my nursing staff , " phillips said . "	it all flows more , and i think will be a lot more efficient . "	when ui health care leaders first established a relationship with the disney institute , a plan to send staff to orlando for training in 2010 at an expected cost of $ 130,000 drew criticism from some legislators and public .	the hospital instead brought disney institute trainers to iowa city on several occasions , running about $ 15,000 .	ui officials believe the training and the concepts have and will lead to better experiences and services for patients , boutros said .	the onstage/offstage concept is used on a smaller scale at two other ui clinics , in muscatine and riverside , but the opening of iowa river landing marks the first large-scale launch in a facility specifically designed and built to use it , boutros said .	they 'll also use iowa river landing to fine-tune the concepts and look for ways to integrate more of the onstage/offstage at the main hospital campus and other clinic locations , he said . "	it 's more about transforming into a culture of everyday excellence , " he said .
a former new hampshire state trooper has been convicted and sentenced for falsifying commercial vehicle inspection reports .	forty-seven-year-old lawrence fredette of meredith was convicted of three counts of tampering with public records and given a suspended sentence thursday in concord district court .	he must complete 20 hours of community service and pay $ 260 in restitution .	fredette resigned from the state police and surrendered his certification as a police officer .	he was assigned to the commercial vehicle enforcement unit when he submitted a total of 15 fictitious vehicle-driver examination reports .
the aaa hoosier motor club reports that indiana 's statewide average price of a gallon of gasoline jumped 3 cents on tuesday , bringing the average price in the state to a two-year high .	the average cost for a gallon of regular unleaded was $ 3.08 on tuesday .	aaa says the last time gas prices were that high in indiana was october 2008 , when prices were $ 3.15 .	that was in the wake of hurricane ike interrupting oil production in the gulf of mexico .	indiana gas prices reached a record high on sept. 16 , 2008 , with an average of $ 4.17 .	a year ago , the statewide average gas price was $ 2.58 .
the supreme court 's resounding rejection of a conservative attempt to gut president barack obama 's health care overhaul wo n't stop republicans from attacking the law they detest .	but now , their efforts will be chiefly about teeing up the issue for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections .	the court 's decision left republican lawmakers stunned and uncertain about some of their next steps .	most agreed they would continue trying to annul the entire law and erase individual pieces of it , like its taxes on medical devices .	yet many also conceded they have little leverage to force obama to scale back ?	let alone kill ?	one of his most treasured legislative achievements . "	we 'll continue to pick away at the law , " said republican sen. john barrasso , a leader of senate republican efforts to craft a bill responding to a court victory that never came . "	but ultimately our goal is to repeal and replace , and that 's not going to be possible until after the 2016 elections , " when republicans hope for a republican president .	that leaves republicans mostly using efforts to void or dramatically weaken the health care overhaul to contrast their views with obama 's for voters .	yet though few would admit it , the court 's ruling caused many republicans to exhale with relief .	by leaving intact federal subsidies that help millions afford health care , the ruling lets republicans bash obama 's law in their 2016 campaigns without having to quickly help those who would have lost assistance .	taking away those benefits could have created many angry voters . "	there is n't some sort of , that sword of damocles hanging over our heads that people are going to lose their care in 30 days or something , " said republican rep. greg walden , who heads house republican campaign efforts .	republicans have promised to repeal and replace obama 's law since its 2010 enactment , but have yet to rally behind a plan doing that .	a bill temporarily continuing the subsidies this year would have faced a difficult path to passage , thanks to conservative reluctance to abet obama 's health law in any way .	had the republican-backed lawsuit by conservatives succeeded , the 34 states likeliest to lose subsidies included many that will be pivotal in next year 's elections .	that included florida , a key presidential state where a national high of 1.3 million people could have lost assistance , plus pennsylvania , illinois , ohio , wisconsin and new hampshire , where republican senators could face tight re-election battles and worried about constituents losing aid . "	the court has saved republicans from themselves , " said former rep. tom davis of virginia , who once led the house republican political organization .	underscoring that the court decision left intact the issue 's high-wattage political appeal , it took just minutes for both sides to use the ruling for political fundraising .	republican hopeful jeb bush , the former florida governor , emailed for money to stop " the overreaches of the last six years , " while senate democrats warned that republicans have " pledged to destroy obamacare . "	the decision was a relief to the health care industry , which feared chaos in the insurance market , and business groups hoping congress would now turn to making specific changes in the law to ease employers ' costs .	in thursday 's ruling , the justices by 6-3 left intact subsidies that help 8.7 million people buy health insurance ?	most of whom analysts say could n't otherwise afford coverage .	conservative plaintiffs said the law 's wording limited that aid to states running their own insurance marketplaces ?	not the three dozen states using the federal website healthcare.org .	the law 's defenders said killing those subsidies would destabilize health insurance by increasingly leaving only sicker , costlier people with coverage ?	raising everyone 's rates . "	congress passed the affordable care act to improve health insurance markets , not to destroy them , " chief justice john roberts wrote in the majority opinion , using the law 's formal name .	roberts ' deciding vote found the law constitutional in 2012 . "	we should start calling this law scotuscare , " said dissenting justice antonin scalia , using the court 's acronym .	savoring his triumph at the white house , obama noted that his law has had five years to take hold and said : " this is not about the affordable care act as legislation , or obamacare as a political football .	this is health care in america . "	even so , republicans had little reason to back off , especially those concerned about primaries from conservative challengers .	an april associated press-gfk poll showed that 71 percent of republicans oppose the law , compared to 33 percent of independents and 14 percent of democrats .

ohio announced the closing of another juvenile correctional facility thursday as the number of young people sentenced to time in the state detention system continues to fall .	the shuttering of scioto juvenile correctional facility in delaware in central ohio in may will leave the state with just three detention facilities .	it had eight as recently as 2007 .	the center , with a $ 28 million budget , houses only 38 young people , among them 18 girls , the only female youth under the agency 's supervision .	the state houses a total of 525 juveniles , down 160 from just two years ago .	the agency had nearly 1,300 young people in 2009 , the year it closed facilities in marion and another one in delaware .	scioto 's 247 employees will be offered jobs within youth services , said agency spokeswoman kim parsell .	budget savings will be passed along to local programs and to the remaining three state facilities , parsell said . "	as the number of youth served in our facilities continues to decrease , it allows us to reduce our costs and facility needs , " youth services director harvey reed said in a statement .	the union representing many of the guards at the center called the closing unnecessary and dangerous .	christopher mabe , president of the ohio civil service employees association , said the decision shuffles young people into already overcrowded local facilities .	ohio has closed several juvenile detention facilities in recent years as more and more youths going through the court system are held in locally run centers in an effort to keep them closer to home .	statewide , about 5,000 children go through juvenile courts each year .	one result is that the state system has increasingly housed older and more violent youth , those individuals whose crimes or behavior were n't appropriate for local facilities .	handling these youth has presented challenges for the system , which for years was under a court mandate to end a culture of violence .	the state 's remaining centers are circleville juvenile correctional facility south of columbus ; cuyahoga hills juvenile correctional facility in suburban cleveland ; and indian river juvenile correctional facility in massillon in northeast ohio .

though the sushi and sashimi combo at the yama restaurant in hanover probably is n't what their newest students had in mind , dartmouth college is doing its best to welcome a group whose study abroad plans were derailed by the earthquake and tsunami in japan .	dartmouth , which last year accepted students displaced by earthquakes in haiti and italy , is now taking in seven students from brown university and boston university who were indirectly displaced by the disasters in japan .	colleges and universities around the country have been cancelling their study abroad programs in japan , bringing home students who were already there and cancelling plans to send students this spring .	that has created problems for students who attend schools where the spring semester started in january .	but dartmouth was able to accommodate them because it operates on a quarter system , with the spring quarter starting on monday .	after a few days of scrambling to get everything in place , six students from brown and one from bu will start classes in hanover on monday , dartmouth spokesman justin anderson said .	ben dewinter , associate provost for international programs at boston university , said bu officials contacted dartmouth last week when they realized that dartmouth 's academic year might make it an option for the displaced students . "	students are grateful there 's an option , and this is a very good one , " he said . "	on the other hand , the timing was difficult .	everything happened on such short notice , so it 's not easy to make a u-turn and begin at another institution . "	students who did n't take dartmouth up on its offer will attend summer school in boston instead , he said .	dartmouth , which has a strong program in japanese language and literature , has an orientation program for new or visiting students each quarter , and the residence hall advisers have been asked to get in touch with the incoming students to help with the transition , said lindsay whaley , associate dean for international and interdisciplinary programs at dartmouth . "	this has been a challenging situation for the students , resetting their expectations for what they 're going to be doing this spring and needing to make a decision quickly about whether they wanted to spend the spring term at dartmouth and trying to figure out which courses they could take , " he said . "	it 's really been impressive to see them deal with the ambiguities and stresses of getting all this done , and they 've done great . "	the university of notre dame in indiana has three students in the same situation ?	the spring semester started in january , but they were n't scheduled to leave for japan until late this month .	spokesman dennis brown said the school will work with those students individually to figure out a way for them to remain on campus and on schedule .	one option may be looking at other study abroad programs , he said .

a massive failure of the state 's problem-plagued centralized computers continued to hit several state agencies tuesday , making it difficult for virginians to get a driver 's license or file tax returns and make payments .	the virginia information technologies agency has been trying since wednesday to fix the computer outage that affected nearly 30 state agencies .	the outage also prompted gov. bob mcdonnell to call for an independent third party to investigate the problems , including whether contractor northrop grumman should reimburse the state for lost business and productivity .	as of tuesday , computer problems continued to affect the department of motor vehicles , the department of taxation and the state board of elections .	other agencies also were experiencing minor issues relating to the failure at vita 's large suburban richmond computing center , one of several data storage systems in different parts of virginia .	teams are trying to get all the agencies completely up and running and are making significant progress , virginia 's secretary of technology jim duffey said in a statement .	he asked for " continued understanding and patience of state employees and citizens as this work continues .

leaders of two tea party groups said a decision tuesday by wisconsin 's elections board not to accept third-party evidence of fraud in recall petitions targeting republican gov. scott walker has put the integrity of the election in jeopardy .	the attorney for recall organizers called the tea party request ridiculous .	if the groups find any serious problems , they can make them publically available for walker to bring to the government accountability board 's attention before it determines whether to order a recall election , democratic attorney jeremy levinson said .	the board agreed with the recommendation by gab director kevin kennedy not to allow outside groups to intervene in the process .	the board is currently reviewing an estimated 1.9 million signatures on petitions seeking the recall of walker and five other republicans .	the recalls were largely fueled by anger at a law proposed by walker and passed by the republican-led legislature that severely limited the collective bargaining rights of public workers .	its review is focused on making sure the required information was entered with the signature and the date is within the allowable time period .	the board is also seeking to identify duplicates and obviously fake names .	ross brown , president of the tea party group we the people of the republic , said the elections board was n't doing enough to weed out fraud , and that " clean and honest elections " are at stake . "	we are finding abnormalities , we are finding duplicates , " said larry gamble , spokesman for the wisconsin grandsons of liberty , the other tea party group .	the two groups had enlisted more than 13,000 volunteers , including at least one person from all 50 states , to help build a database to review the signatures , he said .	it takes 540,208 valid signatures to order a recall election against walker .	organizers said they turned in more than 1 million signatures , a number they say makes an election inevitable .	but walker and other recall opponents have called for a thorough analysis of the signatures to weed out duplicates and others that should n't be accepted , including from people not living in wisconsin or whose names were forged .	the five retired judges who comprise the gab agreed with staff 's determination that outside groups ca n't bring challenges to the board .	the law only allows for the board to consider rejecting signatures based on evidence brought forward by its staff or the targeted office holders , kennedy said .	petition circulators are allowed to defend against those challenges .	just as the court system does n't allow people to walk off the street and present evidence , the gab should n't change its established process for reviewing and challenging petition signatures either , kennedy said . "	we 're not pursuing an agenda one way or another , " said judge david deininger , chairman of the board . "	we 're simply trying to follow the statute and have the process be as true to the language of the constitution and statutes require . "	while the gab wo n't be accepting the findings of the tea party groups , the groups will be posting their results online .	both kennedy and jeremy levinson , the attorney for the recall groups , said walker 's campaign could then access that information to make its challenges . "	that information can be put in place if it 's real and they have it , " levinson said .	he called the tea party groups ' requests to have a formal role in the gab verification process " a bit of theater . "	about 460,000 signatures would have to be disqualified in order for the walker recall election not to proceed .	the republican party is working in conjunction with the walker campaign to do its own separate review of the petitions , which also involves constructing a database .	the four targeted state senators ?	van wanggaard of racine , terry moulton of chippewa falls , scott fitzgerald of juneau and pam galloway of wausau ?	have until thursday to file signature challenges .	walker 's challenges are due feb. 27 and lt. gov. rebecca kleefisch has until march 5 .	the gab has until march 19 to verify all of the recall petitions but could seek an extension from a judge .	the board has already been granted a 30-day extension for the work of verifying the estimated 1.9 million signatures .

a former democratic state lawmaker who owns coal mines and helped regulate the coal industry on the house natural resources committee told a federal jury thursday that it was " awkward " when a state mine inspector assigned to his mines asked him for money .	but w. keith hall said he gave kelly shortridge the money anyway because shortridge was a friend and , as a powerful state lawmaker in impoverished eastern kentucky , that 's what you did to help people .	federal prosecutors said it was more than awkward for hall to make loan payments for shortridge and pay him $ 25,000 as part of an acquisition deal with jim justice , a billionaire whose coal companies have a history of safety violations , that netted hall millions of dollars . "	is n't part of that deal that you would have an inspector that was on the take ? "	assistant u.s. attorney erin roth asked hall during his testimony thursday .	hall said he never asked shortridge for favors , but that he hired him as a private consultant because of his connections in the coal industry .	shortridge was one of three consultants hall hired to help him find a buyer for one of his coal mines in eastern kentucky .	one consultant was house majority floor leader rocky adkins , who hall said set up a dinner meeting with officials from kentucky fuels , one of justice 's companies , that eventually led to the company purchasing the mine and , prosecutors say , earned hall more than $ 5 million .	but hall described shortridge as a " good political friend , " a popular figure in this tight-knit community who once ran for school board and helped run a little league program .	he said their relationship soured when he refused to pay shortridge for a deal that fell through , causing shortridge to intimidate some of hall 's business partners .	hall said shortridge complained to state officials about him , calling him a " wacko " and an " out of control lex luthor , " a reference to the villain in the superman comic book series .	but prosecutors pointed out that hall requested shortridge to be his mine inspector in 2006 and even recommended him for a promotion to state officials .	they showed a photo of hall and shortridge with democratic house speaker greg stumbo at the kentucky capitol , which hall had signed and referred to shortridge as a future director of a state agency .	hall said the inscription was a joke and he bristled when roth asked him if he has paid other mine inspectors . "	i 'm insulted by your question , " he said . "	i 've never paid a mine inspector . "	his payments to shortridge , hall said , were to help him when he was close to losing his house and to help buy his son a car so he could attend eastern kentucky university .	he said other payments were " legitimate business transactions " that were written from his company to a consulting company owned by shortridge 's wife .	thursday was the fourth day of hall 's trial , which has featured testimony from state officials and hall 's estranged wife .	hall 's defense attorneys , father and son brent and bryce caldwell , have pointed out shortridge did cite hall 's coal mines for safety violations and his work was verified by his supervisors . "	if there was some corrupt intent , it did n't work , because a citation was issued , " brent caldwell said .	they argued that hall had no motivation to bribe shortridge because hall was not liable for state fines because a contract he signed with kentucky fuels shielded him from responsibility .	prosecutors argued that hall 's protection from liability was not solidified until 2014 , years after hall had paid shortridge .	the trial is scheduled to resume friday .
god never told the world to go to church .	he told the church to go to the world .	that 's the idea behind bar church .	organizers say it 's a place where people can meet up for worship , socialize and grab a pint at the same time ?	without judgment .	more than 60 people came out to bar church 's launch party and worship service jan. 8 at stella blue , 221 s. fifth st. , for live music , drinks and free food .	worshipping in an active bar that serves alcohol ?	aka barchurchspringfield.com ?	is an idea started locally by brandon damm , 26 , a member of iworshipcenter and a licensed minister through five fold international ministries . "	jesus was a lover of people and went into the world , " damm said . "	that 's kind of our mission with bar church .	it 's to go where the people are , to go where people are comfortable . "	turns out , a lot of people feel more comfortable in a bar .	while opening a church in a bar may sound a bit unorthodox , the result , damm hopes , is not inebriated churchgoers , but rather a weekly get-together focused on spreading god 's word . "	alcohol itself is not really to entice people to come .	mixed with american traditionalism and traditional religion , alcohol has been made out to be all bad .	it 's just a social gathering point , " he said . "	even though ' bar ' is in the title and a bar is the location , it 's not the pivotal point of what we 're trying to do . "	so why a bar ?	jesus , damm said , gathered with sinners , too . "	maybe you grew up in a church that was really dominant and demanding and portrayed god as this judgmental god with a hammer that 's going to lay the smackdown on you , " he told wednesday night 's crowd . "	that 's not the god i know .	the guy i know hung out with prostitutes .	the guy i know hung out with tax collectors .	the guy i know hung out with people that drank . "	initial ' push-back ' as damm 's pastor at iworship , eric hansen , who 's also founder of five fold international ministries , said he helped damm in the early stages , but bar church is now damm 's project . "	( damm ) came to me a couple of months ago and said he wanted to do something in a bar , " hansen said . "	( iworshipcenter is ) very forward thinking , so that did n't catch us off guard at all . "	hansen said he initially received some " push-back " from religious friends about opening a church in a bar , according to an open letter posted on iworshipcenter 's blog dated dec. 12 . "	they think that i 'm promoting drunkenness and debauchery , " hansen wrote . "	they think that because i host recovery/sobriety programs at the church i pastor that having a gospel meeting in a bar is somehow incongruent .	nonsense . "	asked by the state journal-register to respond to criticism he 's received about his leading of sobriety classes while promoting bar church , hansen said he 's not promoting drunkenness . "	i can be pro-healing , and not pro-hospital .	i can be for sharing the love that comes through jesus without saying everyone should go out and get smashed , " he said . "	i can be pro-hospital , which does n't make me pro-sickness . "	a new audience damm said a fresh approach to worshiping is needed at a time when mainstream religious congregations continue to dwindle across the country .	he believes a younger generation of churchgoers , also known as millennials ?	people born in the early 1980s through the 2000s ?	continue to see the church as too old-fashioned or perhaps too political . "	i think the church has been putting this wall between themselves and the rest of civilization .	that 's not the way i believe it should be , " he said . "	mainstream media in general has a negative perception about christianity with the whole gay debate .	... we 're trying to portray an image that is more christ-like . "	damm said he recognizes not everyone will be on board with the idea of mixing alcohol with church-going .	since the bar church 's facebook page launched in october , damm said he has received " hate mail " via the social networking site .	beyond the church 's critics , however , is the support he 's received , damm said .	on wednesday , brock webb , 38 , of springfield , a congregant of hansen 's iworshipcenter , said he and his friends came to stella blue in support of damm 's idea .	it 's a great way to reach people who would n't otherwise feel comfortable in a traditional church setting , webb said . "	a lot of people have stereotypes for church .	this blows the stereotypes away , " webb said . "	i always had that stereotype , and i never had a desire to go to church until iworship .	bar church is a neat idea . "	joshua cole , 31 , another iworshipcenter member from springfield , said bar church is something he never thought he 'd see in central illinois .	bar church plans to host gatherings at stella blue each wednesday night , with inspirational messages , food , drinks and a rotation of live bands and djs .	people can even buy bar church merchandise , including shirts , bottle openers and beer koozies .

the 105-year history of the peerless mill in rossville will end with a wrecking ball and the site will take on a new life as a scrap yard .	peerless owner les coffey purchased a demolition permit monday morning and said he plans to level the 27-acre site , sell the scrap he can and run a scrap yard and waste transfer station . "	everybody i 've spoken to is very disappointed , " said coffey , who added that his phone was flooded with messages after the news broke . "	it 's just time to move on .	we ca n't keep pouring money in to prop the project up . "	crews began taking down lights monday , and all of the demolition will be finished by dec. 31 , he said .	in a news release issued monday , coffey noted that all current tenants will be allowed to stay until their leases are up and the prater 's flooring building would remain up and running . "	we must for the benefit of the creditors of peerless self storage and the shareholders change our direction of business , " coffey wrote in the release . "	beginning immediately we will proceed with demolishing of the complex . "	the mill , which is the largest single tract of land in rossville , dates back to 1905 and , at one time , employed thousands of workers as one of the largest woolen mills in the world .	the facility was sold to burlington industries in 1952 , then was taken over by the hutcheson family and the rossville development corp. before a disastrous fire in june 1967 .	no one died , but 15 industries that rented space inside the 360,000-square-foot structure were destroyed .	after coffey bought it from the hutchesons in 2007 , he and the city have been involved in disputes that have led to lawsuits and countersuits over the past few years .	coffey had hoped to rent out the space to tenants , but he blamed interference from city officials as the idea 's downfall . "	it is very regretful that a dream of mine will never be realized , as i have invested four years of my life into this project , " he wrote in the release . "	however , reality must take precedence over dreams and the reality is the city of rossville and their management will never allow the peerless site to thrive . "	rossville mayor johnny baker wished coffey luck on his new venture . "	as long as he complies with the zoning and everything , what he does with it is up to him , " baker said . "	i say good luck to him . "	baker said the property is zoned industrial and he believed a scrap yard would fit into that description . "	i 'll guess we 'll cross that bridge when he applies for a business permit , " the mayor said .	in the past , city officials have pointed to the road and rail connections at the site , wishing it could be developed for industry to bring jobs back to the town .	instead , coffey said he will sell the bricks , wiring and beams from the building to recoup his investment and pay creditors .	ken rule of black diamond slate in savannah , ga. , recently bought bricks and beams from two other now-demolished mills in greenwood , s.c. , and albany , ga. .	he said the market for salvage materials is n't what it was a few years ago , but he and others probably would be interested in buying some of the peerless remains .

a couple accused of running a pill mill are operating a second clinic and using profits they hid from the government to take extensive gambling and shopping trips , federal prosecutors said in a filing thursday .	the government wants the bond revoked for nancy and lester sadler , accused of running a pain management clinic in a southern ohio county considered one of the worst places in the country for painkiller addiction .	the sadlers did n't tell the government they run another clinic making $ 15,000 a week , " while the taxpayers are footing the bill for the sadlers ' criminal defense , " timothy mangan , an assistant u.s. attorney , said in the filing .	the government also alleges the sadlers require patients visiting their pain management clinic , in columbus , to bring a second patient not being treated for pain .	the government calls these sham patients meant to subvert a new law limiting how much of a clinic 's business involves pain treatment .	the government says one of these sham patients died after obtaining pills at the columbus clinic . "	the sadlers ' continued operation of an illegitimate pain clinic also creates a substantial risk to the community , " mangan said in the filing , arguing it justifies revoking the couple 's bond arrangements .	the sadlers are free on their own recognizance , according to filings in the case .	richard goldberg , attorney for lester sadler , said thursday he had not seen the motion and could not comment .	goldberg said previously that the sadlers did everything they could to ensure proper medical care was given to patients at their clinic in waverly , which has since closed .	a message was left with nancy sadler 's attorney , steven hillman , who in the past has not returned phone calls about the case .	a year ago , the sadlers submitted affidavits saying they made a combined monthly income of $ 3,860 and required government-funded defense attorneys .	the government says that since the original indictment , the couple has continued to operate ohio medical west , a clinic in columbus , with lester sadler as owner and nancy sadler as an employee .	the government says that the columbus clinic takes in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and that after expenses the couple is spending thousands of dollars on purchases for an embroidery business and on gambling trips .	the government says this year alone , nancy sadler gambled with $ 58,533 at the hollywood casino in indiana , while lester sadler gambled with $ 21,368 .	the 2010 indictment against the sadlers alleges that employees at their southern ohio pain clinic were required to set up enough appointments to fill 30 to 40 prescriptions of powerful painkillers a day at $ 125 a visit .	workers who met the quota would receive a week 's pay for three or four days ' work , according to the government .	those who slipped up got less .	in may , gov. john kasich signed into law a bill cracking down on pain management clinics , dubbed pill mills by their critics and blamed by health officials for contributing to hundreds of overdose deaths in ohio each year .	the law requires the state board of pharmacy for the first time to license pain clinics as distributors of dangerous drugs .	the law also puts limits on how many pills a doctor could dispense directly at a clinic and tries to reduce the illegal distribution of prescription painkillers by creating a statewide system for collecting unused supplies of the narcotics .

from highway 28 , the new hampshire farm once owned by poet robert frost may seem unchanged from a century ago .	yet the picturesque new england white barn and farmhouse recently underwent thousands of dollars in renovation including a new roof , foundation work and other upgrades .	and for the first time in decades the robert frost farm ?	which sits on 30 acres in derry , n.h. , about 10 miles north of the massachusetts border ?	now closely resembles the place frost left as he embarked on a life as a full-time poet , officials at the historic site say .	this year marks the 100th anniversary of when frost sold the poultry farm for $ 1,100 to help pay for a three-year adventure in england where he would begin obtaining recognition in the world of letters .	after walking away from the farm , frost won four pulitzer prizes for poetry , read at the inauguration of president john f. kennedy and received a number of honorary degrees and awards .	but frost scholars and enthusiasts say the poet never forgot those years in derry .	that 's because the derry years were some of the happiest of his life , and the farm and its new england grounds were the source of inspiration for some of his most famous poems . "	this is where he spent the most time with his family and had the happiest of memories , " said justine golden , a tour guide . "	after he left here , it was never the same .	his life was filled with tragedy . "	new hampshire officials hope the restored house along with newly placed markers around the hyla brook nature poetry trail , or the area that surrounds the farm , will give visitors a sense of how the environment played a role in some of frost 's more memorable works .	the new hampshire division of parks and recreation recently placed markers at the spots scholars believed inspired frost to later write the poems " nothing gold can stay , " '' mending wall " and " stopping by woods on a snowy evening , " among others . "	derry was a place where he grew as a poet , " said mark schorr , executive director of the robert frost foundation , based in nearby lawrence , mass. " the farm turned out to be exactly what robert frost needed .	it gave him time to dream . "	frost moved to derry in 1900 after his grandfather agreed to buy the farm for him on one condition ?	frost and his family stay there for at least 10 years before frost could own it .	frost worked as a poultry farmer for five years , before turning to teaching as an english instructor at nearby pinkerton academy .	in between his duties as a farmer , frost walked the land and wrote constantly .	he and his wife , elinor , homeschooled their children and frost began to use the landscape in his work .	upon leaving the farm , frost won acclaim for his poetry but his wife died of breast cancer in 1937 , his son carol committed suicide , daughter marjorie died after childbirth , and daughter irma was later committed to a mental hospital .	the poet also battled bouts of depression .	frost died in 1963 .	to recreate his happy life at the farm , the new hampshire 's division of parks and recreation , which purchased the property shortly after frost died , restored furniture and purchased period pieces around the home under the advisement of his late daughter , lesley frost ballantine .	for example , visitors to the farm will see antique books frost read as a child and a chair next to the kitchen window where frost wrote .	some items , officials say , were definitely used by frost , including the pair of wooden toilets near the entrance . "	of all the things in this house , " said golden , " we are sure the great man sat here .

the federal reserve under ben bernanke has gone further than ever to explain its policies to the public .	it 's ready to go further still .	a fed policy meeting tuesday will likely focus , in part , on an evolving plan to reveal the direction of interest rates more explicitly .	the fed may decide , for example , to regularly update the public on how long it plans to keep short-term rates at record lows .	the new communications strategy could be unveiled as soon as next month .	most analysts expect no announcements tuesday about the new strategy or any further steps to try to strengthen the economy .	they think the fed wants to delay any new programs , such as additional bond purchases , to see if the economy can continue the modest gains it 's been making .	still , the u.s. economy remains vulnerable , especially to the impact of the financial crisis and likely recession in europe .	so the fed is keeping its options open .	it 's already taken numerous unorthodox steps to try to lift the economy .	december , for example , will mark three years since it cut its key rate , the federal funds rate , to a record low of between zero and 0.25 percent .	it has also bought more than $ 2 trillion in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to cut long-term rates and lower borrowing costs .	the hope behind both actions was to embolden consumers and businesses to borrow and spend more .	lower yields on bonds also encourage investors to shift money into stocks , which can boost wealth and spur more spending .	one possibility , should the economy worsen , would be for the fed to buy more mortgage securities .	doing so could help push down mortgage rates and help boost home purchases .	the weak housing market has been slowing the broader economy .	the boldest move left would be a third round of large-scale purchases of treasurys .	but critics say this would raise the risk of future inflation .	and many doubt it would help much , because treasury yields are already near historic lows .	unless europe 's crisis worsens and spreads , few expect another program of treasury purchases .	still , it ca n't be ruled out . "	europe is going to be a big headache for quite a while , " said diane swonk , chief economist at mesirow financial . "	we are going to have a lot of icebergs to dodge , and if the situation dramatically deteriorates , the fed will act . "	on nov. 30 , the fed joined other central banks in making it easier for banks to borrow dollars .	the goal is to help prevent europe 's crisis from igniting a global panic .	the announcement sent the dow jones industrial average up nearly 500 points , its best day in 2 1/2 years .	after its september meeting , the fed said it would re-arrange its bond holdings to stress longer-term maturities , to try to exert more downward pressure on long-term rates .	that followed the fed 's announcement in august that it planned to keep its benchmark rate at a record low until at least mid-2013 .	it was the first time it had committed to keeping the rate there for a specific period .	now , fed officials are debating how much further to go to signal a likely timetable for any rate changes .	under one option , the fed would start forecasting the levels it envisions for the funds rate over the subsequent two years .	it could publish this forecast , as it now does its economic outlook , four times a year .	doing so would help assure investors , companies and consumers that rates wo n't rise before a specific time .	this might help lower long-term yields further ?	in effect providing a kind of stimulus .	some worry that such guidance risks inhibiting the fed 's flexibility to revise interest rates if necessary .	others counter that the fed would n't hesitate to shift rates if warranted .	and they say the benefits of clearer guidance outweigh any constraints it might impose . "	you could make investment decisions with more certainty , " said mark zandi , chief economist at moody 's analytics .	the fed is also discussing setting an explicit target for " core " inflation .	core inflation excludes the volatile categories of energy and food .	it 's remained historically low ?	around 1.5 percent by one measure .	making a specific rate an official goal could anchor inflation expectations and guide investors on when the fed might adjust rates to try to hit the inflation target .	stabilizing prices is one part of the fed 's dual mandate .	it 's also supposed to try to maximize employment .	one member of the policy committee , charles evans , thinks the fed should set a threshold for unemployment , too ?	say , 7.5 percent .	it would keep rates low until unemployment fell below that level .	unemployment is now 8.6 percent .	among the fed 's options for more explicit guidance , many economists say an interest-rate forecast is most likely .	a probable time for an announcement would be after the fed 's jan 24-25 meeting , when it will update its economic forecasts .	such a move would follow other steps to make the fed more transparent that began under chairman alan greenspan and accelerated under his successor , bernanke .	not until greenspan 's tenure did the fed even announce any changes in its benchmark rate .	until then , financial firms had to study the fed 's purchases of treasurys in the bond market to try to determine whether it was raising or lowering rates .	previous chairmen tended to think the fed operated best when it could keep financial markets guessing . "	i was there when arthur burns was chairman : his motto was , ' never tell anybody anything , ' " economist david wyss said of burns , who was chairman during the 1970s .	private economists widely support the fed 's shift toward more transparency .	most dismiss concerns that the fed , by being more open and specific in forecasting rates , might lock itself into wrongheaded policies . "	if we had another financial crisis , people would understand that the fed would throw their forecast out the window and do what they needed to do , " zandi said . "	i do n't think it hamstrings them in any way . "
cisco systems inc. , the world 's largest maker of computer-networking gear , said tuesday that it plans to start paying a dividend before the end of its current fiscal year , in july .	like several other big technology companies , cisco has a large cash balance , and analysts have speculated that it would use it for a dividend .	cisco did n't say how big the dividend would be , saying it would determine it in the coming months while considering tax policy and broader market conditions .	speaking at a conference for analysts and investors , chief financial officer frank calderoni said the yield would be " competitive . "	cisco shares rose 65 cents , or 3.1 percent , to $ 21.91 in early afternoon trading tuesday .	cisco had $ 40 billion in cash on july 31 .	however , $ 33 billion of that sits at overseas subsidiaries .	like other big exporters , cisco has been reluctant to bring the money back to the u.s. , to be taxed at the 35 percent corporate rate .	because it needs some of its u.s. cash for other corporate needs , cisco may have to tap its overseas hoard to pay a dividend .	many companies took advantage of a tax amnesty for repatriating cash in 2004 , and some have been pushing for a repeat of what was supposed to be a one-time event .	calderoni said that developments in repatriation rules would affect the size of the dividend .	cisco has been returning cash to shareholders through buybacks , amounting to $ 65 billion to 2010 .	calderoni said the company is committed to continue doing buybacks and will continue to invest in research and design and purchase other companies .

lucille farrington thought the little boy in the back of her fourth-grade class had a hearing problem .	he 'd stare into space throughout class , she recalled this week , before she could finally jolt him back to attention .	eventually , the boy was sent for a hearing test , farrington said , though after a time he returned to class with an entirely different diagnosis . "	his parents were going through a divorce , " said farrington , who has since retired and moved to hanover . "	he was severely depressed . "	farrington said that 's only one of many times in her teaching career she watched as divorce , the death of a parent or some other personal loss affected a child she taught .	and beyond the lost class time , she said , those personal problems damage a child 's self-esteem , often for years . "	you 're not going to learn long division when you 're thinking about losing someone you love , " she said . "	and so many kids needed help with that . "	after searching for a solution , in 1988 farrington found rainbows ?	a program started in chicago in 1983 to help counsel children ?	and worked with children around her school district in baltimore for eight years , she said , talking , listening and assuring youngsters they 're not alone .	she watched it make a tremendous difference , she said .	eventually , after she retired and moved to hanover , farrington got away from the program , she said .	but in recent years , talking to friends and listening at church , she started seeing the same pattern here . "	i wanted to help , " she said . "	i wanted these kids to learn to trust again after a tragedy . "	and in october , local families will be able to take advantage of that same program that 's been helping children for more than 20 years , with the second annual rainbows program to be held at st. paul 's lutheran church on york street in hanover .	the church 's pastor , tina minnich , said this week the program comes after a successful opening program last year , and at a time when it 's most needed , with ever more children going through parents ' divorce , death and even deployment overseas . "	we 've had three deaths just this year in the church , " she said .	all those things leave their scars for those left behind , especially on children , who often internalize their feelings and struggle to work through complex emotions , minnich said .	and those feelings , if not properly addressed , only serve to cause problems later in life , she said . "	i 've seen it manifest as kids get older , and result in hurtful behaviors , " she said . "	it 's the only way they know to numb the grief . "	but minnich said the rainbow program , with its focus on open communication and active listening by trained facilitators , has a history of success , something she wants to continue at her church .	everything discussed is confidential , too , she said , and there 's never any pressure , only the option to share and maybe not feel so alone .	the children are put in small groups , according to age , and meet with the same adult guide for an hour each week , for six weeks , minnich said , adding the program is free to all participants thanks to donations from four local funeral homes .	farrington said the most important thing she 's seen in the program over her years of involvement is the sense of belonging it can foster in children , once they see others working their way through similar issues .	chances are what a child is feeling after a loss is much the same as anyone their age feels , she said , and that 's what each child has to realize . "	you ca n't change the situation , and you ca n't make it all perfect , " she said . "	but you can let kids know they 're not alone out there . "

"	it makes it easier for us to fulfill our responsibilities and promises to the property taxpayer , " said paulsen .	still , he said lawmakers will face hard choices in forming a budget .

"	this does n't solve the problem but it moves us close to fulfilling some of those promises . "	senate majority leader michael gronstal , d-council bluffs , agreed . "	i think it 's positive news , but i do n't think in any way people should think we 're out of the woods yet , " said gronstal .	gronstal noted that lawmakers last session were able to use one-time sources of revenue , such as federal stimulus money , to balance the budget .	that money wo n't be available again . "	while it 's good news it does not by a long shot solve all of our budget problems and we 're going to struggle through a very challenging budget year , " gronstal said .

the u.s. senate has passed a bill giving american indian tribes more authority to combat crime on their reservations .	the tribal law and order act , co-sponsored by republican sen. john thune of south dakota and democratic sen. byron dorgan of north dakota , now heads to the house .	thune said he expects the legislation to pass that chamber , too , and go on to be signed by president barack obama .	the measure provides for the appointment of special u.s. attorneys to ensure violent crimes on reservations are prosecuted , improves training for reservation police , expands the sentencing authority of tribal courts and improves the collection and reporting of indian crime data .	thune said the legislation would allow u.s. magistrates to hold trials and other proceedings in indian country as opposed to having to take defendants to the nearest federal court . "	that actually was something that was requested by the tribes , " he said thursday .	the bill also includes language ensuring that if tribal governments and federal courts enter into agreements allowing for such trials , the u.s. department of justice is authorized to provide technical and other assistance .	the new legislation is on top of a u.s. department of justice effort to dispatch 30 new prosecutors to jurisdictions that serve indian country .	the new hires represent the department 's first specific increase in indian country prosecutors in almost a decade , and they will target violent crime .	one area that has been trying to combat a severe crime problem is the standing rock sioux reservation , which straddles the south dakota-north dakota border .	in 2008 , the bureau of indian affairs had only nine officers to patrol the 2.3 million acre reservation , so only one officer at times was on duty to patrol a land mass about the size of the state of connecticut .	residents who testified at two hearings held on standing rock made it clear that violence and sexual assault on the reservation had been compounded by the growth of gang activity , thune said .	to help turn the tide , the u.s. interior department recently sent 25 more law officers to standing rock as part of a temporary surge that sens. thune and dorgan are hoping to make permanent .	dorgan said monitoring by the u.s. park service is showing that the temporary increase is resulting in hundreds more arrests . "	while i 'm pleased to hear that our first step to beef up law enforcement is leading to more arrests and successfully increasing public safety , there is clearly more work to be done , " he said in a statement .	sen. tim johnson , d-s.d. , said the bill strengthens the hand of law enforcement by giving officers the resources they need while meeting the nation 's treaty and trust responsibilities .	another provision of the tribal law and order act requires the department of justice to report on reservations ' use of community policing , a concept that gained popularity in the inner cities in the early 1980s .	the goal is to create a change in the culture by attacking smaller crimes before larger crimes take hold . "	it starts with broken windows , " thune said . "	if you do n't fix those things and you do n't try to prevent those types of things then the bigger crimes become much pervasive as well , and there 's a lawlessness that starts to permeate these areas . "	the bill also raises the maximum hiring age of bureau of indian affairs law enforcement officers from 37 to 47 to increase the pool of potential recruits .

several people have been packing up and saying goodbye to their homes near lake michigan as a deadline has arrived for them to move out under decades-old agreements for expansion of the indiana dunes national lakeshore .	among those moving are charlotte and herb read , who 've lived in their beverly shores home for 58 years and worked for the park 's establishment during the 1960s .	they 're moving into a home not far away . "	it 's not in the dunes so we 're going to have to travel back to the dunes to visit .	but we 're not in the dunes anymore , " charlotte told the post-tribune . "	that 's hard . "	officials expected the about two dozen residents who faced a thursday deadline for moving to cooperate and leave in accordance with their contracts , park spokeswoman lynda lancaster said .	but george and ann bagnall said they did n't plan to move despite a 1985 sales contract that they say they felt pressured to sign . "	we would not move out willingly , " ann bagnall said . "	right now , we 're homeless as far as they 're concerned .	i expect that 's what they 're going to say .	but we once had legislation that said we could stay forever . "	the 1966 bill to authorize the park guaranteed residents would be free from property condemnation , but congress repealed that exemption in 1976 .	lancaster said people who did n't move voluntarily would face eviction . "	it 's like any other land owner .	you go through the eviction process .	it 's notification and then you have to go through a court hearing , " she said . "	it 's the same process every owner has to go through when a person said they 'd go and they do n't . "	mike mccluskey and denise declue bought the remainder of the time in a house formerly owned by another resident and were moving out thursday . "	the mood is melancholy as we 've had a great decade here , " mccluskey said . "	we 've enjoyed ourselves immensely .	we knew what the deal was when we came here and we 're very happy with the deal .

police and social scientists are n't sure how to explain an apparent drop in the number of accidents attributed to slick roads since winter weather began hitting arkansas before thanksgiving .	the state has been raked by snow or ice a dozen times since november , double the usual number of storms .	police say it 's likely that more drivers are choosing to stay in on bad-weather days .	an arkansas state police spokesman said it appears motorists are finally heeding warnings to wait for safer driving conditions , while one pennsylvania psychology professor said it 's possible that drivers are gaining confidence on slick roads .	a professor in alabama says it 's unlikely southerners will become skilled on ice because snow removal practices are inconsistent in towns not accustomed to wintry weather .

"	it 's not only a lot of snow , but a lot of the heaviest wettest snow that you ever want to see out there , " said peter judge , spokesman for the massachusetts emergency management agency .	nearly 670,000 people remained without power as of noon sunday .	crews were working to restore electricity to hospitals , nursing homes and other facilities first and could not say how long it might take to get power back on for everyone . "	this is not going to be a quick fix , " judge said . "	it 's totally smashing any historical records . "	in a northampton neighborhood , dale carhardt shoveled the sidewalk for neighbor janet richards .	neither had power sunday afternoon , but both were taking it in stride . "	i 'm not sure about tonight , if i should stay in a motel or not , " richards said . "	at some point in time i 'll decide , but until then , there 's not much to do , read , take a walk around , stuff like that . "	before this weekend , most parts of massachusetts had seen no more than an inch of snow from an october storm , with the record closer to 6 inches in higher elevations .	some places in western massachusetts got as much as 30 inches from saturday into sunday .	a train from chicago to boston got stuck saturday night in palmer , mass. , when a rockslide caused by the storm blocked the tracks about 10 p.m. .	the 48 passengers who spent the night on-board had heat and electricity and were given free food and drinks , amtrak spokeswoman vernae graham said .	buses arrived about 11 a.m. sunday to take them to their destinations .	train service was suspended in much of the northeast corridor , including between boston and providence and between new haven , conn. , and springfield , mass. .	in ashburnham , in the northern part of the state , sarah arel was shoveling and raking snow off the roof of her 1780s farmhouse sunday morning .	she described the snow as " beautifully white . " "	however , it 's very deep , very heavy , and we must have gotten over 20 inches , " she added .	she said she and her husband were surprised to see so much snow in october . "	i did not expect this at all , " she said . "	winter is not our favorite season .	this is a little bit too early knowing how long winter lasts . "	in worcester , city manager michael v. o'brien asked families to postpone trick-or-treating until thursday , when temperatures are forecast to be in the 60s , the worcester telegram & gazette reported .	he said he 's not sure the city charter gives him the authority to move the holiday , but he is concerned that kids wo n't be safe trick-or-treating on darkened streets covered with piles of snow and downed trees .	at least one death was blamed on the storm , a 20-year-old springfield man electrocuted when he stopped near police and firefighters examining downed wires , police capt. william collins said .	power was out in much of the city and lines were down all over .	just two months ago , irene knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people and some remained in the dark for a week , prompting complaints about how utilities responded . "	it 's a little startling .	i mean , it 's only october , " said craig brodur , who was playing keno with a friend at northampton convenience in western massachusetts when the power went out saturday night , forcing the half-dozen people inside to scatter .	the forbidding forecast had boston mayor thomas menino urging occupy boston activists who 've been camped out on a downtown square for weeks in an anti-wall street protest to leave for the night .	but media volunteer jason potteiger said that about 200 people still staying in tents at the site were in good spirits and the people running the food tent had more donations of hot meals than they knew what to do with . "	the term solidarity is used a lot in this movement , and i think the sentiment that 's all over camp is that if oakland and denver can make it through tear gas and rubber bullets , we can make it through a little snow and sleet , " he said .
ohio 's confirmed number of west nile virus cases has increased to 60 , more than double the human cases documented just three weeks ago , state health officials said .	two people ?	a 76-year-old man in southern ohio 's hamilton county and an 87-year-old man in cuyahoga county in northeast ohio ?	have died in what officials are calling one of the worst summers for the mosquito-borne virus in the state and across the nation , the columbus dispatch reported friday .	statewide , 47 people have been hospitalized , with symptoms that began between july 10 and aug. 28 .	nationwide , 1,993 cases have been reported to federal health officials , an increase of 403 in a week , according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention 's weekly update .	deaths from the disease this year have hit 87 , up from 66 reported a week earlier .	one in five people who become infected with the virus will develop west nile fever , according to the cdc .	symptoms include fever , headache , tiredness and body aches .	as of friday , 36 of ohio 's 88 counties had confirmed west nile cases in humans , mosquitoes or horses , tessie pollock , a spokeswoman for the ohio department of health , said friday .	cuyahoga county had reported the most human cases of any county , with 21 , pollock said .	drought and heat in ohio in recent months increased the prevalence of the west nile-carrying culex mosquito , according to pollock .	the mosquito prefers to breed in organically rich water sources , such as water in the process of evaporating from ditches and catch basins where leaves and other matter accumulate . "	we knew early on that this was going to be a bad year , " she said .	pollock said the state has focused on educating the public , including recommending that people use insect repellent or wear long sleeves and pants while outdoors , especially at dusk and dawn .	they also are advised to eliminate mosquito breeding sites such as water-holding containers and other standing water .	the decision on whether to spray for mosquitoes is left up to local areas , and columbus public health in central ohio 's franklin county ?	where four human cases have been reported ?	increased its spraying to six days this week .	the agency typically has sprayed three or four days a week , spokesman jose rodriguez said .	the agency focuses on areas where mosquitoes caught in traps have tested positive for the virus .	columbus has found 110 pools of mosquitoes testing positive for west nile virus this year , compared with 12 pools of positive mosquitoes in columbus and nearby worthington last year , said luke jacobs , a section chief with the city 's division of environmental health .	hamilton county public health in cincinnati is not spraying , but has mosquito traps that are monitored daily throughout the county , which has reported five human cases . "	when we catch a positive pool , we are there immediately , " agency spokesman mike samet said .	he said the department also works to educate the public on prevention .
moving on washington and lifestyle wires .	edited by usa today @ by mimi hall and nanci hellmich usa today washington - her daughters were 6 and 9 , and michelle obama was like any other working mom - struggling to juggle office hours , school pick-ups and mealtimes .	by the end of the day , she was often too tired to make dinner , so she did what was easy : she ordered takeout or went to the drive-through .	she thought the girls were eating reasonably well - until her pediatrician in chicago told her he did n't like the weight fluctuations he was seeing . "	i was shocked because my kids looked perfectly fine to me , " obama says . "	but i had a wake-up call . "	like many parents , however , " i did n't know what to do . "	today , the self-described " mom in chief " is launching let 's move , a campaign to help other parents deal with a national health crisis she describes in epic terms .	the goal : to eliminate childhood obesity in a generation . "	it 's an ambitious goal , but we do n't have time to wait , " the first lady said in an interview with usa today in her spacious office in the east wing of the white house . "	we 've got to stop citing statistics and wringing our hands and feeling guilty , and get going on this issue . "	she says she intends to " sound the alarm " about the epidemic : about 32 percent of children and adolescents today - 25 million kids - are obese or overweight , according to the centers for disease control and prevention .	those extra pounds put kids at a greater risk of developing a host of debilitating and costly diseases , including type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol .	a 2005 study found that kids today may lead shorter lives by two to five years than their parents because of obesity .	meanwhile , the costs " take your breath away , " obama says .	obesity costs the country a staggering $ 147 billion a year in weight-related medical bills , according to government data .	obama says she will use all the power of her white house pulpit to promote a multifaceted campaign that will include more healthful food in schools , more accurate food labeling , better grocery stores in communities that do n't have them , public service announcements and efforts to get children to be more active .	some of her plans , such as tax incentives for businesses , will need congressional approval .	let 's move ( letsmove.gov ) aims to do for healthy eating and exercise what the government 's anti-smoking campaign did in the 1960s : change how people think about their health . "	the first lady having a huge microphone and a spotlight is really helpful , " health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius says . "	it 's a big health crisis .	we need to involve not only the kids but the families . "	ideas grew from a garden obama , 46 , is announcing the campaign a little more than a year after she and her daughters , malia , 11 , and sasha , 8 , moved into the white house on the day barack obama was sworn in as president .	obama said then that she would spend much of her first year in washington making sure her kids adjusted to their new school and to life being shadowed by the secret service .	but the seeds of the obesity campaign were planted months ago - in an organic white house garden she set up with the help of local elementary schoolchildren .	and her passion for working on the problem grew . "	the garden was an important first step - just sort of exploring the ideas around nutrition and children , " obama says . "	i was curious to find out whether kids connected with this issue if we talked about it in terms of fun and gardening . "	and they did . "	kids from urban environments , from households ( like ) mine , who were raised on fried foods and good , tasty stuff , were fully engaged in the process of planting these vegetables and watching them grow and harvesting them and cleaning them and cooking them and eating them , and writing about how vegetables were their friends , " she says . "	so we thought we could be on to something here if we make this conversation a national conversation . "	she is taking that conversation to schools around the country , mayors ' organizations and the nation 's governors .	and her campaign has commitments from the nation 's pediatricians , children 's tv networks and websites such as nickelodeon and sports teams such as the new york yankees .	each will do whatever it can do best , she says , to spread the message that it matters what children eat and how much they move .	yankees centerfielder curtis granderson , who will be with obama at today 's announcement , says he wants to encourage kids to do what he did as a child : put aside the video games and get outside and play . "	we did n't realize the importance of it at the time , " he says . "	but we would be outside for hours at a time having fun . "	obama says her busy schedule in the next couple of years will reflect her commitment to the cause .	last week , she started by filming the campaign 's first public service announcement , a direct message to parents . "	i know from my own experience , " obama says . "	i would move heaven and earth to give my kids all the chance in the world for them to be at the top of their game in every way , shape and form .	let 's move operates under the principle that every family wants the same thing for their kid .	so we 're going to figure out how to make it easier for them to get it . "	that casual , down-to-earth approach as the mother of two girls has earned her higher approval ratings in the polls than her husband 's since he took office .	in an interview about the childhood obesity campaign , she wears gray slacks and a lavender sweater , the kind of everyday outfit that works for her whether she 's hula-hooping with schoolchildren on the south lawn or visiting federal agencies to thank employees for their hard work .	the issues she 's addressing are serious , but she says she will keep it conversational . "	the tone , hopefully , that i approach this , is one that is inclusive , and not judgmental - and helpful . " '	a no-downside issue ' political observers say it 's the right kind of campaign for a first lady who wants to make a difference but wants to be careful not to delve too far into policy the way hillary rodham clinton did with health care when her husband held the presidency . "	childhood obesity is a no-downside issue , " says boston university journalism professor elizabeth mehren , who has written extensively about political spouses . "	it 's something that mothers can connect to , so it fits in with her ' first mom ' agenda . "	at the same time , " it 's a back-door connector to that very pressing issue for her husband : health care . "	others also applaud her choice , saying it goes beyond previous campaigns such as nancy reagan 's anti-drug effort and laura bush 's literacy push . "	first ladies have taken on issues in the past , but this is different because childhood obesity is such a pressing public health concern , " says margo wootan , director of nutrition policy for the center for science in the public interest , a consumer advocacy group . "	interest in nutrition is at an all-time high , and there is a lot of concern about the health and financial effects of obesity . "	all the stars are aligned for her to make an impact . "	boston pediatric endocrinologist david ludwig , one of the researchers who showed obesity may shorten kids ' lives , says : " we ca n't just decry childhood obesity while continuing to condone junk food advertising aimed at young children and underfunding school lunch and physical education programs .	what the first lady can do is help give momentum to that effort in a way few other people can . "	an ambitious plan the campaign will begin the way many government efforts do : with the appointment of a federal task force that will give government agencies 90 days to figure out what they plan to do to help .	obama 's office already has lined up commitments from mayors , business leaders , grocery store owners , school lunch suppliers , non-profit groups , retailers and foundations .	other elements of the plan , several of which will need approval in congress because they require new funding or offer tax breaks , include : - the american academy of pediatrics will encourage its 60,000 members to check the body mass index ( bmi ) , a number that takes into account height and weight , of all children at every checkup , and to give every child a kid-friendly prescription with suggestions for healthy , active living at those visits , says judith palfrey , president of the academy .	the group had been working on the idea , and the campaign " was the magic moment to roll it out with the blessing of the first lady , " she says .	- $ 400 million in tax credits and other incentives to get grocery stores to move into " food desert communities " where people do n't have access to major grocery stores and have to rely on corner markets , convenience stores and hybrid gas stations that may charge more and have fewer healthful choices .	it will also get fresh foods into smaller stores .	- a new foundation made up of existing foundations and groups to monitor the campaign .	- $ 25 million for schools to renovate their kitchens to replace deep fryers with equipment needed to store more produce and serve more nutritious food .	- $ 10 billion over 10 years for the child nutrition reauthorization act .	some of the money would be used to provide free and reduced-priced school meals for a million more children a year and to help schools serve more nutritious foods .	agriculture secretary tom vilsack says he 's encouraging schools to " focus on community gardens and school gardens , which can provide additional supplies . "	healthful eating at school is important : about 31 million kids eat lunch at school every day , and 11 million eat breakfast .	overall , kids consume about 30 percent to 50 percent of their calories in school .	reports from the institute of medicine , which advises congress on health and science , recommend booting junk foods out of schools and making dramatic changes in school meals .	many companies are on board with improving school food , obama says , by reducing the amount of salt , fat and sugar in school lunches and increasing the amount of whole grains and fresh produce .	there are also changes to be made in the snacks provided to students . "	there is no reason why we ca n't have water , healthy juice drinks in vending machines , granola bars , trail mix , whole-grain sandwiches , " she says .	just as important as better food , obama says , is physical activity .	the government recommends that children get 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily .	education secretary arne duncan says improving food and physical activity at schools is " the right investment " of resources .	little steps can add up despite her lofty goals , obama says , she wants to reassure fellow parents that they do n't have to make huge changes or break the bank to have an influence on their kids ' weight and health .	the obama family has a chef now , of course , and the first lady no longer has to worry about whether she has time to cook healthful meals .	but before she got to the white house , she says , she made a set of small changes to her girls ' diets that made a difference .	she started cooking once or twice a week more often than she had been .	instead of giving them juice boxes at meals and in their lunches , she gave them low-fat milk or water .	and she eliminated after-dinner desserts on weekdays . "	the kids did n't even notice , " she says . "	you take stuff out , they complain about it for , like , two seconds , and then it 's like , ' ok , i 'll drink the water . ' "	she also says she does n't want parents to beat themselves up if they slip up from time to time or get a little relaxed about the food they serve or the time their kids spend in front of a screen . "	we do n't have to be 100 percent perfect , " she says . "	my kids eat dessert .	my kids watch tv .	i love burgers and fries , and i do n't want to live a life where i can never have them again .	and if we told families and children that that was the answer , we 'd never get there . "	the beauty is we do n't need to be 100 percent of the way there .	if we get 20 percent of the way there , we will change the health status of our kids for a generation . "
a man charged by the fbi with illegally obtaining a credit card using the identity of microsoft co-founder paul allen will first face desertion charges filed at the louisiana army base where he 's now stationed .	major lewis kliem told the associated press on wednesday that 28-year-old brandon lee price is charged with illegally leaving his unit at fort polk in early july 2010 .	he was n't found by the army until he was charged by the fbi in pittsburgh last month , kliem said .	price is n't in custody .	he has returned to fort polk and is serving with his unit , the 10th mountain division , while the desertion charge is processed , said kliem , the senior prosecutor who handles criminal prosecutions at the louisiana base .	the idea is for price to show that he can be a productive soldier , kliem said . "	that 's the only way you 're able to help yourself at this point . "	price 's commanders must decide whether to proceed with a general court martial , under which price could face an 18-month jail sentence if convicted , or a special court martial ?	a faster tracked process that carries a maximum 12-month sentence , kliem said .	if convicted , price could also face either a dishonorable discharge or a bad conduct discharge , which is slightly less serious , kliem said .	the army has a 120-day speedy trial rule and that is just one reason the military expects to process the desertion charge against price before he returns to pittsburgh to face prosecution on the bank fraud charge , kliem said .	a spokeswoman for the u.s. attorney 's office in pittsburgh confirmed that the desertion prosecution will take precedence but otherwise declined to comment .	the ap could n't immediately obtain a copy of that document , and kliem said he 's not sure it 's public record at this point .	kliem could say little about the desertion charge other than the army contends price left his unit " on or about july 2 , 2010 " ?	or not quite six months after he enlisted on jan. 19 , 2010 .	once a soldier is absent without leave for 30 days , he can be officially dropped from the army 's rolls and entered into the national crime information center computer as a suspected deserter . "	so that if he 's picked up for another crime , it should pop up on any criminal history check that he 's wanted , " kliem said .	that 's what happened when price was arrested on march 2 in pittsburgh .	according to the fbi complaint filed last month , price called citibank in january pretending to be allen and changed the address on one of allen 's accounts from seattle to pittsburgh .	he called back three days later to say he had lost his debit card and asked for a new one to be sent to him , the complaint said .	the card sent to the pittsburgh address ?	which is where investigators believe price lived with his parents ?	was used to attempt a $ 15,000 western union transaction and make a $ 658.81 payment on the armed forces bank loan account , according to the complaint .	store security videos also captured images of price trying to buy items at a video game store and a dollar store .	the fraud was detected by the bank , which alerted law enforcement officials , and none of allen 's other accounts were accessed .	only the loan payment apparently was approved , according to court records and a spokesman for allen .	citibank is n't commenting on the case , citing customer confidentiality .	price 's public defender on the fbi bank fraud charge has n't responded to requests for comment .	a message was left wednesday at price 's pittsburgh home number listed in court papers .	price is entitled to a free military defense attorney on the desertion charge , though the ap could n't immediately confirm whether one had been appointed .	kliem said that might take a day or so because the desertion charge was filed only tuesday .
authorities say they 've charged a former florida man in the fatal stabbing of a 20-year-old man in a rural upstate new york village .	police in walton in delaware county say 20-year-old lejuan wainwright was charged with second-degree murder in saturday 's late-night stabbing that occurred during an argument with the victim outside a residence in the village , 75 miles southwest of albany .	authorities have n't released the victim 's name .	wainwright was sent to the delaware county jail without bail .	a message left at the office of his attorney , aaron dean , was n't immediately returned .	police say wainwright moved to walton from st. petersburg , fla. , earlier this year .
workers placed sandbags and stones to strengthen river levees in flood-ravaged pakistan 's south as the rising water threatened new areas sunday .	three towns in the thatta district were in danger , and officials began evacuating around 150,000 people from lower lying areas saturday .	the surge in the indus river is expected to empty into the arabian sea after passing through .	at least two levees along the river are potential trouble spots and are being strengthened , said hadi bakhsh kalhoro , an official with the sindh province disaster management authority . "	we are hopeful the flood will pass on to the delta without creating much trouble here , " he said .	the floods began in late july in the northwest after exceptionally heavy monsoon rains , expanding rivers that have since swamped eastern punjab province and sindh province in the south .	the deluge has affected about one-fifth of pakistan 's territory , straining the civilian government as it also struggles against al-qaida and taliban violence .	at least 6 million people have been made homeless and 20 million affected overall .	the united nations has appealed for $ 460 million in emergency assistance , and expects to achieve that goal as the scope and scale of the disaster has become more apparent .	the u.s. has promised $ 150 million .	pakistan can ill-afford the crisis .	its economy was already being kept afloat by billions in loans from the international monetary fund , and the cost of rebuilding after the floods will likely run into the billions .	the imf said it would meet with pakistani officials this week to discuss the floods and what the country must do to cope . "	the imf stands with pakistan at this difficult time and will do its part to help the country , " said the imf 's masood ahmed , director of the middle east and central asia department .
less than two months after a minnesota prosecutor was shot by a defendant in a grand marais courthouse , a legislative committee advanced two bills designed to beef up security for county attorneys , including one that would let prosecutors carry guns .	the star witness at thursday 's house public safety committee hearing was tim scannell , the cook county attorney who was shot three times dec. 15 by the man he had just successfully prosecuted in a criminal sexual conduct case .	scannell showed no outward sign of his injuries as he took his seat to address the committee . "	when you attack a prosecutor , you are not just attacking an ordinary citizen , " scannell testified . "	you are making a political statement that the charges against you are , that the crime the state believes you have committed , should somehow be nullified .	i think that 's what occurred in my situation . "	scannell testified only on behalf of a bill that would enhance criminal penalties for assaulting or killing a prosecutor , allowing a defendant to be charged with first-degree murder .	of the gun bill , scannell said he was " not a gun person " and was unlikely to carry one if it becomes law .	but he said he supports the legislation , which would exempt county attorneys from a statute that prohibits local government employees from carrying firearms . "	i do n't particularly like the idea that local government officials ca n't carry weapons when other citizens can , " he said .	the chief sponsor of the bills , rep. tony cornish , r-good thunder , brought in several other attorneys to testify in favor of the firearms bill .	chris rovney , an assistant county attorney in blue earth county , recalled an incident with a drug dealer he was prosecuting who had conspired to shoot and kill him . "	we 're not asking for any greater rights than any other citizen in the state of minnesota has , " rovney said .	later , he added : " by virtue of what we do for a living , we 're put in an elevated zone of danger . "	several committee members , including rep. linda slocum , dfl-richfield , said they were concerned the bill would create confusion about bringing a gun into a courthouse and into the courtroom itself , where judicial order prohibits firearms .	heather martens , whose group protect minnesota works to stem gun violence , also worried that bill 's language did not explicitly say whether county attorneys would be allowed to carry guns into courtrooms .	cornish explained that the bill would not affect the no-guns rule in courtrooms , and that courthouses would decide individually where else within the courthouse guns would be allowed .	martens also said that pistol-packing prosecutors could offer a target for defendants desperate enough to grab for their weapon . "	sometimes it happens that someone loses control of their gun , guns have been grabbed away from bailiffs , " martens said in an interview after testimony . "	the prosecutor is going to be a lot more distracted in the courtroom than the bailiff . "	committee members later said they interpreted the bill as not allowing for guns in courtrooms and passed the bill without amendment to clarify language .	cornish said he expects both bills to head to the full house for a floor vote .
after this week 's attempt to restart mideast peace talks , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is now caught between undesirable choices .	despite abbas ' deep misgivings , a jordanian offer to salvage the peace process may be his best hope .	abbas has been searching for alternatives since the last round of peace talks broke down in september 2010 .	refusing to negotiate while israel expanded its jewish settlements , he appealed to the united nations to recognize an independent palestine and moved to reconcile with the rival palestinian faction hamas .	neither move paid off , and both are now in limbo .	any of abbas ' options carries great risk ?	whether it 's opening outright negotiations with israel , taking unilateral action at the u.n. or cozying up to the islamic militant hamas .	the quiet talks hosted by jordan between israeli and palestinian negotiators on tuesday ?	the first face-to-face talks between them in 15 months ?	could provide a way for him to avoid having to choose a particular path .	abbas would pay a heavy price among palestinians if he returns to formal peace negotiations without an israeli settlement freeze , a step that prime minister benjamin netanyahu staunchly refuses .	the 76-year-old abbas would face widespread public criticism for backing down and harsh condemnations from hamas .	hamas , which has long criticized any peace efforts with israel , has already threatened to walk away from reconciliation efforts if negotiations resume .	with islamic groups across the middle east gaining in the aftermath of the arab spring , abbas is unlikely to take any step that boosts hamas ' hand .	the palestinian factions have been at odds since hamas ousted abbas ' forces and seized control of the gaza strip in 2007 .	reconciliation is essential for abbas ' dream of establishing a palestinian state in gaza , the west bank and east jerusalem .	abbas ' fatah movement and hamas have tentatively agreed on holding new elections in the palestinian areas this spring , with the idea of forming a new government afterward .	but pushing forward with these reconciliation attempt could lead to international isolation for the palestinians and almost certainly torpedo any hope for restarting peace negotiations .	israel , along with the u.s. and the european union , consider hamas a terrorist group , and israel would break off talks with a palestinian government that includes hamas .	in addition , the west would likely cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid needed to keep abbas ' west bank government afloat .	reviving the u.n. bid would be equally risky .	abbas ' appeal to the u.n. security council for membership last fall immediately ran into trouble .	he was unable to muster enough support in the 15-member council , and the united states has threatened to veto the measure if it is revived .	when the palestinians managed to win admission to the u.n. cultural agency unesco , israel and the u.s. responded by withholding badly needed funds due to the palestinians .	the u.s. continues to withhold some $ 150 million in developmental aid .	the palestinians say there is no point in negotiating while israel continues to expand settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem .	they say construction on captured lands where the palestinians want to establish their state is a sign of bad faith .	israel says negotiations should resume without any preconditions and insists it has the right to continue settlement building .	the palestinians have set a jan. 26 deadline for resuming talks .	abbas ' office issued a statement wednesday night saying the palestinians will continue with the meetings in jordan until the end of the month .	in washington , state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said the u.s. was pleased that the sides are talking again and that the first meeting was constructive .	ahead of tuesday 's meeting , abbas threatened to pursue " harsh " measures against israel if a freeze is n't in place .	bassam salhi , a member of a committee exploring the palestinian options , said the choices include new action at the u.n. , such as seeking international condemnation of israeli settlements and reconsidering palestinian security cooperation with israel . "	abbas will not go for negotiations with israel unless it freezes the building in the settlements , " salhi said .	most likely , abbas will drift among small overtures to israel , hamas and the west to keep his options open , said palestinian political scientist george gaqaman .	abbas does not want to hurt his standing among palestinians but can not afford a major diplomatic confrontation with israel , the west or neighboring jordan . "	the palestinian leadership is in a difficult position , " he said . "	the continuation of settlement construction obstructs the possibility of having a palestinian state , and the palestinians ca n't boycott the political efforts .	therefore we see maneuvering , not strategy . "	at tuesday 's meeting in amman , jordanian foreign minister nasser judeh said there had been no breakthroughs , but announced the israelis and palestinians had agreed to continue their dialogue in search of an agenda for substantive negotiations .	the next meeting could be as soon as next week .	these talks , expected to take place quietly and out of the public eye , could provide abbas the cover he needs while he looks for a way out of the deadlock .	abbas , deeply suspicious of netanyahu , can use the coming months to assess the israeli leader 's positions on key issues .	in amman , for instance , israel received a palestinian proposal for future border arrangements and promised to respond with its own proposal in the near future .	while israel has ruled out a settlement freeze now , officials have said they are ready for " mutual confidence building measures " should negotiations resume .	perhaps with this in mind , judeh , the host of tuesday 's meeting , voiced some hope for progress . "	the important thing is that the two sides have met face to face today , " he said . "	we want to create the appropriate atmosphere to reach solutions . "
illinois sen. mark kirk on wednesday called for more funding for research to decrease the risk of strokes and to treat those who have them .	the republican from highland park , who suffered a stroke in january 2012 , attended a round-table discussion at northwestern memorial hospital with chicago-area stroke researchers .	he emphasized the importance of funding national institutes of health research .	the nih has implemented a new stroke research network in response to the lack of centralization and efficiency in prior stroke research efforts .	before 2013 , stroke research often would take over 10 years per study and would exceed its budget .	the new regionalized model lowers the cost of research and promotes more timely trial results . "	stroke is the leading cause for disability among adults , " kirk said . "	i look forward to working with nih to ensure that this unprecedented research approach will reduce the incidence of stroke and minimize disability so that we can get more stroke survivors back to work . "	currently , no clinical data exist for stroke rehabilitation .	the new nih research infrastructure will address this problem by conducting a clinical stroke rehabilitation trial in coming months .	dr. donald lloyd-jones of the american heart association and american stroke association said chicago stroke researchers are raising the ceiling of stroke care by creating an environment supporting major scientific advancement and ensuring every stroke patient receive the care they need .	kirk went through months of intense physical and speech rehabilitation at the rehabilitation institute of chicago after his stroke and was able to return to work in washington a year later .
florida insurance commissioner kevin mccarty says homeowner rates in the state are coming down .	mccarty on wednesday gave a report to chief financial officer jeff atwater that looked at annual rate filings made by 30 of the state 's insurance companies .	the report found several companies that represent 20 percent of the market have either decreased rates or asked regulators to allow them to be lowered .	mccarty 's report did not look at all insurers because some have not yet filed with the state .	citizens property insurance , the largest insurer in the state , was also not included .	a national report released last month found that floridians are paying the highest homeowner insurance rates in the nation even though the state has not been hit by a hurricane in nearly a decade .
the value of listening to a brahms piece on a 19th century streicher grand piano must be heard .	collecting grand pianos so one can hear what musical pieces from their respective eras would have sounded like on the instruments of their time may sound unusual to some .	it certainly did to wcvb channel 5 's " chronicle , " which has included patricia and e. michael frederick 's collection of historical grand pianos in a segment on " unusual collections . "	the fredericks say they love to have a chance to spread the word about their piano collection , which has attracted accomplished musicians and beginners alike from all over the u.s. and the world since opening their historical piano study center at the former stevens library building at 30 main st. , adjacent to town hall , in 2000 .	just do n't call it a museum .	though the pianos are very old , some dating as far back as the 1790s , the fredericks say their pianos are meant to be played , rather than observed liked antiques on a shelf . "	i 'm sure they make beautiful furniture , but looking at them that way is boring and dull , " e. michael frederick , 67 , said . "	we did n't get them to be eye candy , " patricia frederick , 68 , said . "	we got them because we wanted to see how music sounded when it was written . "	according to the fredericks , people in the 1800s bought new pianos every few years , the same way people do with computers today , because they were constantly changing and evolving and new sound qualities were being sought .	in that era , they said , pianos from different countries , and even pianos from different makers within the same city , all sounded different , unlike the homogenous sounds of pianos made today . "	people today do n't want to play a piano in one city and have it sound and feel completely different in another , " patricia frederick said .	what they are losing out on , however , are the sounds composers intended them to hear when their pieces are played on the proper instruments , the fredericks believe . "	when people come here and play on our pianos , they hear things in the music they 've never heard before , " e. michael frederick said . "	these effects were easy to accomplish with the piano the composer had , but the modern piano has different goals .	piano companies used to be managed by people who designed pianos .	today , the president is a businessman who could n't design a piano if his life depended on it .	he relies on merchandising and what he thinks will sell . "	patricia frederick said keys on pianos in the past were much different from those of today .	they often had rounded edges and did n't require heavy plunking because the keys had shorter distances to drop and were lifting lighter hammers , resulting in a light , fluttery playing style .	this change in design has affected the posture and style of most pianists , he said . "	we 're very slow , heavy and almost arthritic today in the way we perform , " he said . "	the way people look at music has changed also .	we tend to think of people in earlier periods as being more staid and respectable than they actually were . "	recording is another factor that has changed people 's expectations about music , e. michael frederick said .	today , wrong notes can be digitally changed and performers are expected to sound as perfect and polished as their recordings suggest . "	even the best pianists miss notes , " patricia frederick said . "	people did n't expect to have a canned , perfect performance each time . "	before opening the center in 2000 , the fredericks lived with all of their pianos crammed inside the various rooms of their water street home , some turned on their sides to fit several in each room .	patricia frederick has even created a layout map of the rooms of their house to show all of the inconvenient places where they had been stored .	today , their collection includes 25 pieces ?	brodmanns , bosendorfers , erards , bluthners , streichers and many others ?	at the historical piano study center and an additional nine still kept at home .	the collection includes mainly viennese and parisian pianos , though there are some from london , leipzig , new york and boston .	a piano makes it into their collection only if pieces from that time and location are still widely played and appreciated .	the fredericks have been hosting historical piano concerts in the spring and fall at the ashburnham community church at 9 chapel st. since 1985 .	interest has grown immensely over the years .	patricia frederick said they began with only two or three shows each season and have expanded to six .	the events last year averaged about 100 people per show , she said .	though the fredericks do n't plan on retiring anytime soon , they are looking for people or organizations interested in " protecting the ecological diversity in classical music " and keeping the center open once they do . "	to do something like this right , you have to create the people who will be your successors , " patricia frederick said , to ensure the pianos are properly cared for and preserved for future use .

the state has launched a new emergency alert system to warn residents of tornadoes , chemical spills or other dangers .	the legislature approved the alert iowa system earlier this year .	the annual cost of running it is expected to be about $ 300,000 .	on tuesday , the system was used for the first time at the iowa homeland security conference , where gov. terry branstad sent out a practice message .	a chorus of cellphones chiming was soon heard in the conference room .	about one-third of iowa 's 99 counties will initially be served by the notification system , the des moines register reported ( http://dmreg.co/zgdixy ) .	all counties will later be able to access the program that provides local officials control of how and when to issue emergency and public safety notifications to residents .	counties that already are using other systems can opt to use alert iowa at no additional cost . "	this is a powerful tool , and a tool that i will trust will give us a lot of additional value in warning citizens of additional danger , " said mark schouten , director of the iowa department of homeland security and emergency management .	he said there 's no requirement that counties use the new system .	iowa residents can select which types of alerts they want to receive , such as severe weather and 911 outages .	the alerts can be sent to a variety of electronics , including landline telephones , cellphones and fax machines . "	we believe it will be a tremendous asset to the state of iowa and the counties and cities that use it , " lt. gov. kim reynolds said .
oregon is about to embark on a first-in-the-nation program that aims to charge car owners not for the fuel they use , but for the miles they drive .	the program is meant to help the state raise more revenue to pay for road and bridge projects at a time when money generated from gasoline taxes are declining across the country , in part , because of greater fuel efficiency and the increasing popularity of fuel-efficient , hybrid and electric cars .	starting july 1 , up to 5,000 volunteers in oregon can sign up to drive with devices that collect data on how much they have driven and where .	the volunteers will agree to pay 1.5 cents for each mile traveled on public roads within oregon , instead of the tax now added when filling up at the pump .	some electric and hybrid car owners , however , say the new tax would be unfair to them and would discourage purchasing of green vehicles . "	this program targets hybrid and electric vehicles , so it 's discriminatory , " said patrick connor , a beaverton resident who has been driving an electric car since 2007 .	state officials say it is only fair for owners of green vehicles to be charged for maintaining roads , just as owners of gasoline-powered vehicles do . "	we know in the future , our ability to pay for maintenance and repair ... will be severely impacted if we continue to rely on the gas tax , " said shelley snow with the oregon department of transportation .	other states are also looking at pay-per-mile as an alternative to dwindling fuel tax revenues .	last year , california created a committee to study alternatives to the gas tax and design a pilot program ; washington state set money aside to further develop a similar program ; and an indiana bill directs the state to study alternatives and a test project .	while growing in popularity , electric vehicles and hybrids are still in the minority on american roads , even in a state as green-minded as oregon .	of 3.3 million passenger cars registered in oregon at the end of 2014 , about 68,000 were hybrid , 3,500 electric and 620 plug-in hybrid .	a decade ago , only 8,000 hybrids were registered .	however , fuel-economy for gas-powered vehicles has been increasing as technology is developed that addresses public concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil .	oregon is the only state to actually test-drive the pay-per-mile idea .	the gas tax provides just under half of the money in oregon 's highway fund , and the majority of the money in the federal highway trust fund , of which oregon receives a portion .	oregon 's share of the fuel tax over the past two decades has been mostly flat and in some years declined , state data show .	in 2009 , the legislature raised the tax from 24 cents to 30 cents per gallon , but that 's not enough to avert shortfalls , state officials said , because construction costs increase with inflation .	oregon previously held two rounds of small-scale tests involving gps devices to track mileage .	the current program , called orego , will be the largest yet and will be open to all car types .	of these , no more than 1,500 participating vehicles can get less than 17 miles per gallon , and no more than 1,500 must get at least 17 miles per gallon and less than 22 miles per gallon .	volunteers will still be paying the fuel tax if they stop for gas .	but at the end of the month , depending on the type of car they drive , they will receive either a credit or a bill for the difference in gas taxes paid at the pump .	private vendors will provide drivers with small digital devices to track miles ; other services will also be offered .	volunteers can opt out of the program at any time , and they 'll get a refund for miles driven on private property and out of state .	after the american civil liberties union of oregon raised concerns about privacy and government surveillance , the state built protections into the program , said aclu 's interim executive director jann carson .	drivers will be able to install an odometer device without gps tracking .	for those who use the gps , the state and private vendors will destroy records of location and daily metered use after 30 days .	the program also limits how the data can be aggregated and shared .	law enforcement , for example , wo n't be able to access the information unless a judge says it 's needed . "	this is the government collecting massive amounts of data and we want to ensure the government does n't keep and use that data for other purposes , " carson said .	the orego program is projected to cost $ 8.4 million to implement and is aimed to gauge public acceptance of the idea of charging motorists per mile of road they travel .	it will be up to the legislature to decide whether to adopt a mandatory road usage charge .	one of the biggest concerns will be whether a program like orego could actually discourage people from buying electric or hybrid vehicles .	drive oregon , an advocacy group for the electric-vehicle industry , supports the program because every driver should pay for road repairs , executive director jeff allen said .	still , he said , " the last thing we need to do right now is to make buying electric cars more expensive or inconvenient . "
a member of the public service commission is issuing subpoenas for rural water associations to give him their bylaws .	and the northeast mississippi daily journal reports ( http://bit.ly/wn16im ) that the mississippi rural water association is now advising its members to comply with any subpoena they get from the psc .	but mrwa chief executive officer kirby mayfield said he still believes northern district public service commissioner brandon presley has no right to request the bylaws .	presley acted after north lee county water association 's bylaws did n't comply .	they since have been corrected .	presley , who represents the northern district on the psc , gave the 218 water associations in his district until jan. 18 to turn over their bylaws to his office .	when 92 of them missed the deadline , he extended it to last friday .	when 70 associations still did n't comply , presley began sending out subpoenas .	presley said wednesday that the mrwa for forcing him into the subpoena process by initialing telling the water systems they did n't have to comply with his request . "	they created this entire problem by giving out lousy legal advice in telling these associations to not comply with a regulatory agency , " presley said . "	it 's getting silly . "	mrwa attorney jim herring said the association 's stance is less about compliance and more about preventing big government from imposing itself where it should n't .	the subpoenas are being hand-delivered to association officials throughout the northern district , a process that will take some time , presley said .	the subpoenas command the associations to produce their bylaws within 14 days .

more than 1,700 fairpoint communications workers in maine , new hampshire and vermont went on strike early friday after a failed attempt hours earlier by two unions to re-engage the company in negotiations .	the unions have offered " significant concessions " but the company was n't interested , said peter mclaughlin , business manager of international brotherhood of electrical workers local 2327 in maine . "	the company 's actions have brought us to this place , " he said in a statement . "	we did not want to take this step .	our members want to work ; they want to take care of their customers .	however , our bargaining team worked as hard as we could to reach a fair agreement that would preserve good jobs and help the company prosper . "	the international brotherhood of electrical workers and the communication workers of america announced the strike thursday night , after union officials met with company negotiators earlier in the day in boston . "	the company is not willing to negotiate on anything , so we felt that we 've exhausted all of our options and this company has no interest in reaching an agreement .	they 've really backed us into a corner .	we have no choice but to strike , " said jenn nappi , assistant business manager with local 2327 .	a fairpoint spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the situation .	just after midnight friday , more than 20 fairpoint workers gathered outside a telecom center in portland , holding signs that said " honk for a fair deal " and " fair deal for fairpoint . "	the company , which contends the old contract was out of sync with industry norms , imposed its final contract offer in late august when it declared an impasse after months of negotiations dating back to april .	the strike came two days after the company froze the workers ' pensions , replacing them with 401 ( k ) plans going forward .	the company-imposed contract also requires workers to contribute to health care costs for the first time .	other provisions allow the company to hire contractors and eliminate retiree health care benefits for current workers .	the unions contend that the company is trying to slash costs to make it attractive to prospective buyers and to provide promised dividends to shareholders .	accusing the company of failing to bargain in good faith , they have asked the national labor relations board to order the company back to the negotiating table .	north carolina-based fairpoint , which provides telephone and high-speed internet service , grew six-fold overnight when it bought verizon 's land holdings in northern new england for $ 2.3 billion in 2007 .	some accused the company of biting off more than it could chew , and it filed for bankruptcy 18 months later .	fairpoint emerged from bankruptcy in 2011 but has struggled to become profitable .	the company has yet to reverse net losses posted for every year of operation since the verizon purchase .	in maine , democratic u.s. rep. chellie pingree said the company is to blame for its predicament , and that it must return to the negotiating table . "	this company made an investment they could n't afford and now they are trying to take it out on the thousands of highly skilled men and women who work for them , " she said .

the result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they do n't help prevent chronic diseases and some even seemed to raise the risk of cancer .	in the new study , multivitamins cut the chance of developing cancer by 8 percent .	that is less effective than a good diet , exercise and not smoking , each of which can lower cancer risk by 20 percent to 30 percent , cancer experts say .	multivitamins also may have different results in women , younger men or people less healthy than those in this study . "	it 's a very mild effect and personally i 'm not sure it 's significant enough to recommend to anyone " although it is promising , said dr. ernest hawk , vice president of cancer prevention at the university of texas md anderson cancer center and formerly of the national cancer institute . "	at least this does n't suggest a harm " as some previous studies on single vitamins have , he said .	hawk reviewed the study for the american association for cancer research , which is meeting in anaheim , california , where the study was to be presented on wednesday .	it also was published online in the journal of the american medical association .	about one-third of u.s. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take multivitamins .	they are marketed as a kind of insurance policy against bad eating .	yet no government agency recommends their routine use " regardless of the quality of a person 's diet , " says a fact sheet from the federal office of dietary supplements .	some fads , such as the antioxidant craze over vitamins a and e and beta-carotene , backfired when studies found more health risk with those supplements , not less .	many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the " 100 percent of daily value " amounts that multivitamins typically contain .	science on vitamins has been skimpy .	most studies have been observational ?	they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins , a method that ca n't give firm conclusions .	dr. j. michael gaziano , of brigham and women 's hospital and va boston , led a stronger test .	nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of centrum silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received .	after about 11 years , there were 2,669 new cancers , and some people had cancer more than once .	for every 1,000 men per year in the study , there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills .	that worked out to an 8 percent lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group .	multivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer , which accounted for half of all cases .	they lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12 percent .	there also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users , but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone .	side effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users .	the national institutes of health paid for most of the study .	pfizer inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging .	the main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency , " but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men , " gaziano said .	cancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public .	these participants were healthier ?	only 4 percent smoked , for example .	for people who do want to take multivitamins , doctors suggest : ?	be aware that they are dietary supplements , which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines . ?	ask your doctor before taking any .	vitamin k can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners , and vitamins c and e can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy .	for people having surgery , some vitamins affect bleeding and response to anesthesia . ?	current and former smokers should avoid multivitamins with lots of beta-carotene or vitamin a ; two studies have tied them to increased risk of lung cancer .	jama : http://www.jama.ama-assn.org vitamin facts : http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/antioxidants and http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/mvms-healthprofessional dietary advice : www.dietaryguidelines.gov task force advice : http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsvita.htm vitamin e and prostate study : http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/306/14/1549

"	they 've been doing this for a long time and , every year , i looked on enviously , " stachecki said of the tour , which began in 1992 .	this year , however , everything fell into place .	the trip began in niagara falls , a spot her son had just mentioned as the perfect site for this summer 's family vacation . "	we could have a family vacation and get mom to the starting line at the same time , " she said .	she , husband doug , and son ross , 10 , enjoyed the falls as well as their boat ride underneath the pounding water . "	that was a blast , " stachecki said .	but it was soon time for her own trip , which took stachecki to upstate new york and ontario .	the tour concluded in toronto , which was also the site of this year 's international society of arboriculture conference .	keeping with the johnny appleseed theme , participants planted trees along the route .	but each rider pledged to raise at least $ 3,500 and while she 's close to her goal , stachecki continues to seek supporters .	those interested in making a donation can do so through her web page at http://stihltourdestrees.org/2013-rider-gallery .	hanging out with the 90 or so other riders was fun , she said , but the ride ?	and conference ?	had a serious purpose .	stachecki is using her experience to help spread work about the danger of oak wilt , a deadly fungal infection already detected in livingston county , according to the michigan department of natural resources . "	it could be as devastating as when the emerald ash borer struck , " she said .	the dnr urges those with infected oak trees to remove them , roots and all , before the infection spreads to healthy trees .	that 's the word stachecki also spreads as a tree consultant to golf courses , apartment complexes and other private facilities .	sponsored by the stihl tool company , the tour des trees supports the tree research education and endowment fund .	money raised supports tree fund projects and scholarships .
the mississippi river is expected to crest at vicksburg on saturday but high water levels will linger .	the only time the river at vicksburg has been higher during june , july or august was after the great flood of 1928 when floodwaters took months to recede , national weather service senior hydrologist marty pope said . "	i think we 're running at some of the highest levels we 've had for the summer months .	i do n't remember anytime it 's been this high in recent years , " pope told the vicksburg post ( http://bit.ly/1j5jb33 ) .	the river was at 45.34 feet friday .	it is expected to crest at 45.5 feet saturday . "	once it gets there , it just sits there , " pope said " the biggest threat right now is everything is fairly flat above there , and that 's not a good thing . "	areas of warren county between u.s. highway 61 and the mississippi river were flooded this week . "	it 's not in any houses , but it 's got a whole lot where you ca n't get to them , " sheriff martin pace said while inspecting floodwater this week .	the mississippi river overflow was too deep to drive through with a four-wheel drive truck but not deep enough to launch a boat .	in the eagle lake community , water was about 8 feet deep and covered all but the roofs of carports .	yet , water was still far below the floors of elevated riverfront homes . "	it 's nowhere near the 2011 flood , " pace said .	the river crested in 2011 at 57.1 feet on the vicksburg gage .	in the city , water up in the ford subdivision , but houses and businesses once affected by flooding have been torn down .	though the crest is predicted for saturday , pope said the river might not begin to fall for days or weeks , depending on rainfall in the ohio and arkansas river valleys . "	if this works out between now and sunday , they show about 3 inches just north of st. louis .	there 's still that potential until we get a good fall at cairo , illinois , that the river could turn back around if it does crest at this lower end .	we 're going to have to keep an eye on this for a while .	it 's not over yet , " pope said .

the rhode island turnpike and bridge authority is installing an electronic toll system on the new sakonnet river bridge that authority chairman david darlington said will likely be in place by the weekend but will take about six weeks to wire and test , the newport daily news reported . "	we should be ready ( to collect tolls ) by the end of june or early july , " darlington told the newspaper . "	revenue is about $ 1.6 million a month , so we want to get it in sooner rather than later . "	the toll is set at 75 cents per trip for rhode islanders with an e-zpass transponder .	they will only have to pay for one round trip per day , even if they cross the bridge several times .	non-residents with an e-zpass will pay $ 3.75 per crossing .	those without transponders will have to pay $ 5.25 .	the all-electronic system will have no toll booths .	instead , it will detect cars that pass through the system and will charge the transponder or send a bill to the owner 's address .	local opposition to tolls on the bridge continues , with members of the general assembly from aquidneck island pushing to reverse the plan .	the town of portsmouth is suing to prevent a toll .
u.s. commanders have laid out a range of possible options for military involvement in syria .	they have also made it clear that any u.s. action would likely be either with nato backing or with a coalition of nations .	the military options could include establishing a no-fly zone or a secured area within syria , launching airstrikes by drones and fighter jets , and sending in ground forces to secure chemical weapons supplies .	the white house announced thursday that intelligence officials conclude that the regime of syrian president bashar assad has twice used sarin gas on its own people .	president barack obama has called that a " red line " for taking some kind of further action to assist the rebels , but administration officials say the intelligence is not solid enough to warrant such a move .
the survey of 10 north american airlines ' menus reveals an overall small increase in healthy and low-calorie food choices since last year , says charles stuart platkin , an assistant professor at cuny school of public health at hunter college in new york who has assessed airline food 's nutritional value in six annual surveys .	too many unhealthy items , though , dominate many airline menus , he says . "	airlines are still in the early stages of healthy offerings -- testing , learning and retesting , " says platkin , who edits the website dietdetective.com . "	i believe , in years to come , airlines will realize that healthy and low-calorie offerings are what consumers are interested in purchasing and consuming . "	most in-flight food items have nutritional information on the packaging , but air canada stands out among airlines because it carries nutritional data sheets for passengers for all items it serves , platkin says .	using a zero-to-five-star scale , platkin offers the following health scores for , and comments about , airlines ' food .	scores are based on six criteria : number of healthy foods ; calories ; improvement from last year ; menu innovation ; variety ; and cooperation in providing nutritional information .	air canada ( at ) health score : ( at ) comments : ( at ) this airline cares about the health of its passengers .	the food is called air canada nutricuisine because of its freshness and quality of ingredients .	air canada contracts with a company called food with a conscience to create its menus .	the best snack is nissin foods ' chicken ramen noodle soup .	the meals are relatively low in calories .	go for the chicken or roast beef wrap or the vegetarian sandwich .	the berry and vanilla oatmeal is also a great offering .	virgin america ( at ) health score : ( at ) comments : ( at ) the food has fewer calories and higher nutrient density than last year .	it 's great that virgin america offers on-demand in-flight food ordering via a touch-screen on every seatback .	you can order any time , not just when the carts come through .	for snacks , the popchips are a low-calorie choice , but the best choice is the mixed nuts .	the oatmeal is a good breakfast choice , and the snack boxes , such as the protein meal with hummus , nuts and tuna , are great .	united airlines , continental airlines ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) continental and united have merged and , except for one item , they now offer the same food .	several years ago , united featured an amazing assortment of healthy offerings and was really focused on health .	now , there are only a few healthy choices , but most of the choices available for lunch and dinner have a reasonable calorie count .	all the individual snacks are poor choices except for the roasted almonds , but they 're high in calories and need to be shared with someone else .	on flights longer than two hours , go for the tapas .	us airways ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) the caf?plus snack box is not a bad choice , because you get protein from the tuna , and it 's low in calories .	maybe you can pass up the cookies that come with it .	i also like the cobb salad , and the good news is that the dressing is typically offered on the side .	the only low-calorie individual snack is chips and salsa .	avoid the new bacon/egg salad croissant box at more than 700 calories .	jetblue airways ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) last year , jetblue started to offer more than just snacks but only on longer flights .	the problem is they need to add some healthier meals and snacks .	the individually packaged snacks are portion-controlled , but most lack nutritional value .	the airline no longer offers nuts , which were the most nutrient-dense offering .	for a free snack , opt for the quaker multigrain fiber crisps .	for meal boxes , which can be purchased , the shape up is the clear winner .	it has eight grams of fiber and only two grams of saturated fat .	american airlines ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) the snacks are high in calories with few healthy offerings .	your best bet is an individual snack , the sabra roasted red pepper hummus with pretzels .	if you 're on a long flight , the best choice is a new item -- marcus samuelsson 's new american table turkey and chutney sandwich .	it 's packed with protein and has apple slices .	delta air lines ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) individual snack choices are not very good , but meal choices on longer flights are reasonably healthy .	share the flight delights snack box unless it 's your full meal .	it has a variety of nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories .	of the breakfast options on long flights , your best bet is the breakfast snack , which has light yogurt and a banana .	for lunch/dinner , the chicken and turkey cuban is the lower-calorie choice , but try to eat only half the bread .	southwest airlines ( at ) health score : ( at ) ?	comments : ( at ) there 's not much variety or nutritional value in the food offerings .	go for the nuts , and skip the pretzels and other items .	spirit airlines ( at ) health score : ( at ) comments : ( at ) spirit 's media department did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails for nutritional information .	the information is on the food packaging , so check before you buy .	the cup of noodles is only 300 calories and might suffice as a meal .	bring your own food .

missouri gov. jay nixon for the second consecutive year vetoed legislation friday that would have changed rules for lawsuits alleging workplace discrimination .	the democratic governor also blocked changes to the workers ' compensation system that supporters had hoped would keep more cases out of court .	the governor 's office announced the vetoes in a news release friday .	the republican-led legislature passed both bills last week before adjourning for their annual midterm spring break .	nixon said the most recent workplace discrimination legislation contains the same " fundamental flaws " as the measure he rejected last year during a rally at the old courthouse in st. louis .	the governor said existing protections should remain to people with disabilities , women , older workers and minorities against discrimination .	this year 's legislation " is nearly identical to the bill i vetoed last year because it would undermine the missouri human rights act and decades of progress on civil rights . "	under the workplace discrimination legislation , workers who brought lawsuits would need to prove discrimination was a " motivating factor " and not simply a contributing factor in the employer 's actions .	it also would have linked possible punitive damages to the number of employees at a business with a cap of $ 300,000 .	political subdivisions , such as city governments , could not have been forced to pay punitive damages .	supporters of the legislation said the changes are designed to better align state discrimination rules with federal law .	the workers ' compensation legislation would have included occupational diseases under missouri 's worker 's compensation system instead of allowing lawsuits over those claims .	it also would have barred employees who get hurt on the job from suing a co-worker unless the injury was " purposefully and dangerously " caused .	the legislature could override nixon 's veto and enact the legislation anyway with a two-thirds vote in each chamber .	the republicans control more than two-thirds of the senate but fall slightly short of that mark in the house .

the family of a 15-year-old tabiona girl who died when their ford excursion crashed into a 20-foot-deep sinkhole is suing the utah department of transportation .	the parents of justine barneck said road crews failed to warn motorists of the hazard last july on state route 35 near tabiona .	udot has said it drained creek water that pooled along the highway , but another storm washed the road away .	the father survived with " severe injuries " but his daughter died when the vehicle slammed into the pit , and both were wearing seat belts , the lawsuit says .	michael barneck and his wife , linda , filed the $ 1 million wrongful death lawsuit on tuesday in salt lake city 's 3rd district court .	the road collapsed about 11:45 p.m. july 13 , 2011 , cutting a hole 30 feet wide .	it was " a direct result of the saturated fill and water pressure caused by the water that udot failed to eliminate or warn about .	the resulting hole in the road was effectively invisible in the nighttime hours , " the lawsuit states .	michael barneck drove state route 35 earlier that night without mishap .	he delivered his daughter 's sleep-over companion to her parent after she fell ill .	it was on the return trip ?	about 45 minutes later ?	that barneck and one of his twin daughters plunged into the sinkhole , one of the family 's lawyers , scott bell , told the associated press .

note breakout material at end .	@ by susan wloszczyna usa today toronto - danny boyle , great outdoorsman ?	not bloody likely .	the spiky-haired , bespectacled british filmmaker of irish descent , whose outgoing personality and ready laugh suggest a professorial leprechaun , is the first to admit he is n't the outdoorsy type .	cozying up to a good book in bed is his idea of a grand adventure .	besides , this 54-year-old city dweller gets his kicks by challenging the confines of cinematic conventions .	labeling a project " unfilmmable " is boyle 's cue to sign on .	his extreme thrills are of the vicarious variety , allowing audiences to experience a sickeningly surreal plunge into the so-called worst toilet in scotland ( 1996 's " trainspotting " ) , take a nerve-racking tour through an eerily silent london emptied by a rage-inducing epidemic ( 2003 's " 28 days later " ) or join in a frantic chase through the chaotic crush of humanity in the streets of mumbai ( 2008 's " slumdog millionaire " ) .	it might seem out of character that boyle would be drawn to " 127 hours , " openingnov .	5 .	his follow-up to the crowd-pleasing " slumdog " - winner of eight oscars including best picture and his biggest grosser to date with $ 378 million worldwide - is about as harrowing as a reality-based depiction of man vs. wilderness has ever been on the big screen .	aaron ralston 's autobiography , " between a rock and a hard place , " which recounts how the rock climber escaped from being trapped in a utah canyon for five days in 2003 by amputating his right arm , falls firmly in the unfilmmable category .	a challenging project @ but after boyle finished reading it , he felt compelled to find a way to make a fast-paced action drama out of a situation where the hero barely budges . "	i was obsessed with the intensity of the experience , " he says .	just as the imperiled ralston relies on well-honed survival skills to figure out his escape , boyle used the sum of his moviemaking experience to invent ways to cut through the claustrophobia - diving into a water bottle nearly drained of precious liquid , sending the camera soaring across tantalizingly spacious skies and turning ralston 's own video recorder into both a mirror and a diary of his ordeal .	as a result , what could have been a grueling endurance test of mounting dread instead evolves into a visually and emotionally compelling celebration of the human spirit - one that is already being short-listed as an academy award candidate .	that includes an expected nomination for james franco , who delivers an equally gripping and charismatic performance that is practically a one-man show .	a budding filmmaker himself , the actor relished the opportunity to observe a master at work in such tight quarters . "	what you see is how much energy he has , how passionate he is , how open he is to new approaches , " franco says . "	he strives to be innovative and to entertain . "	a visual and visceral director @ visceral and kinetic are the two adjectives most associated with boyle 's output ever since his first film , the darkly nasty thriller " shallow grave " from 1995 . "	i 've always loved that kind of boldness , " he says of his bag of stylistic tricks that often dare to break the rules . "	i remember always being disappointed that british films were n't very visual .	they were a bit boring , and i always find that frustrating .	apart from great lines from movies , people very rarely remember anything that is said .	it is virtually impossible to get people to remember a character 's name when you come out of a movie .	but , visually , you remember . "	as a young teen , the son of working-class parents born in manchester wanted to become a priest - fans will note an increasing sense of spirituality and moral purpose in his later films - but would later latch on to directing . "	our main exposure to culture was television and occasional visits to the theaters , " boyle recalls . "	i 'm a twin , and on our ninth or 10th birthday , my dad took me to see " the battle of the bulge " and my mum took my sister to see " the sound of music . ' "	given the inventive use of music in his work - iggy pop basically owes his late-life career to the use of " lust for life " in " trainspotting " - the singing nuns might have better served young danny .	high on the influence chart is " a clockwork orange , " which boyle saw when he was 14 .	that was right before the controversial kubrick classic , whose effect can be witnessed in " trainspotting , " was banned in britain after a copycat murder was committed .	his all-time favorite : " apocalypse now . " ''	it was a huge turning point for me .	i love coppola because he has all the artistic influence of art movies but - and this is what i love about the north america tradition - there is a populism , as well . "	hints of the war-gone-mad epic can be spied in 2000 's " the beach . "	after college , he found it easier to break into theater as a director ( " it 's much more democratic than film " ) as well as tv .	why was " shallow grave " his first feature ? "	it was the only movie i had ever been offered , " boyle says , laughing .	but it was impressive enough with its scathing portrait of greedy yuppies to establish him as a talent to watch .	boyle is switching gears after " 127 hours , " going back to the stage again for the first time in 15 years to direct a production of mary shelley 's " frankenstein " that opens in december at london 's national theater .	he also has the honor of being the artistic director for the opening ceremony of the 2012 olympics . "	it 's just coming up the road from me , " says the east london resident . "	it 's like a mile from my house , which is very cool . "	as for what to expect , " i have no idea how to do it , and i think that is a very good place to be . "	filmmaking 101 : boyle learns a lot on the job @ usa today 1 .	small spaces spark creativity . "	shallow grave " ( 1995 ) , a darkly comic condemnation of yuppie greed , taught boyle to deal with space limits . "	we spent most of our time on one set , this house that we built .	it was a crazy challenge . "	2 .	let the audience live vicariously . "	trainspotting " ( 1996 ) re-creates the highs and lows of heroin addiction with fantastical imagery and frantic camera work . "	the appeal is you take a ride .	to feel immersed in it as much as you can .	but you do n't really want to be in that place . "	3 .	do n't get cocky . "	a life less ordinary " ( 1997 ) is a bizarre road movie-slash-love story in which kidnapper ewan mcgregor falls for captive cameron diaz . "	we were arrogant , " boyle says about his first flop . "	there are good bits in it , but it lacks humility . "	4 .	bigger is n't always better .	with 2000 's " the beach , " boyle had major-studio backing and the male star of the moment - the post - " titanic " leonardo dicaprio .	but the fable of a paradise island gone sour never quite clicked . "	i just did n't do it very well , and i know why .	i found myself making a film about a bunch of people i did n't like . "	5 .	be small , scrappy and innovative .	in 2003 , boyle went low-budget again and switched to easier-to-use digital video for " 28 days later , " whose zombie-esque diseased monsters wipe out london . "	i 'm not averse to big movies .	but i 'm not the best guy for those kinds of movies . "	6 .	a spoonful of sugar does n't hurt .	boyle 's r mind-set shifted to pg with 2005 's " millions , " a gentle fantasy about two motherless brothers at odds over found money . "	all my films have a heart , but it 's often disguised with black humor .	i 've learned the power of being slightly more open emotionally . "	7 .	a bright idea is not enough .	boyle attempted sci-fi space yarn with a twist for 2007 's " sunshine . " ''	there had never been a film about the sun , which is the whole reason we are alive . "	critics once again praised his visual flair , but moviegoers stayed away .	8 .	break out of your comfort zone .	with 2008 's " slumdog millionaire , " boyle had to work with whatever the setting offered in bustling mumbai . "	we just opened the camera up and used it , shooting real people along with the actors .	i learned you ca n't control the entire world . "

some denver police officers are using body cameras on patrol as part of a study of their effectiveness , and officials hope to have all 800 patrol officers outfitted with the devices by next year .	officers assigned to the city 's busy downtown area began wearing the cameras in june for the six-month study by taser international inc. and the university of cambridge .	the fatal police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old in ferguson , missouri , has prompted calls for more officers to wear simple , lapel-mounted gadgets that capture video of law enforcement 's interactions with the public .	proponents say the devices add a new level of accountability to police work . "	citizens should have a right to know what the officers are doing , and why they are doing it , " denver police chief robert white said wednesday at a news conference where he displayed the cameras , which can also be clipped onto an officer 's eyeglasses .	the onus is on the officer to turn the device off and on , but a buffer catches the 30 seconds before the officer started recording to show how a situation escalated .	without providing specifics , white said the cameras have already helped reconcile discrepancies between officer and witness accounts .	white said denver is the first city of its size to be part of the six-month cambridge study .	a similar yearlong trial of the cameras in rialto , california , a city of about 100,000 residents near los angeles , showed they reduced the number of complaints against officers and the number of times officers used force .	white said officers will be required to record " pretty much any time they are in an official capacity , " such as responding to 911 calls and traffic stops .	but the department 's still-evolving policy on the cameras will likely forbid their use in more sensitive settings , such as at hospitals , he said .
u.s. sen. bob casey on wednesday wrote to a shell executive in hopes of persuading the oil and gas giant to choose a pennsylvania site to build a huge new chemical plant that could mean thousands of new jobs and millions of tax dollars for the state .	the company has said it will decide early this year where to build the plant from among sites in pennsylvania , ohio and west virginia , and those states ' officials have lobbied shell or offered incentives for what could be a massive investment that rivals the region 's largest industrial plants . "	pennsylvania has everything needed to make it a top choice for shell 's facilities , " casey wrote in his letter to shell executive mark quartermain . "	we have a proven work force , access to water , communities with a long history of working cooperatively with industry , an extensive rail transportation network and appropriate real estate .	pennsylvania also has an exceptional higher education network which will mesh well with shell 's commitment to innovation . "	a spokeswoman for pennsylvania 's other u.s. senator , pat toomey , said wednesday that toomey has been in close contact with state economic development officials who are leading pennsylvania 's effort to land the plant , and members of his staff have met with shell officials . "	we stressed the unbelievable workforce in the region , particularly pittsburgh 's great universities that produce world class engineers and highly skilled workers , the easy access to the inland waterway system in the region , and our strong commitment to the continued development of the shale , " spokeswoman nachama soloveichik said .	ohio 's governor , john kasich , reportedly flew to houston in late november to pitch his state to shell , which is a subsidiary of netherlands-based royal dutch shell plc. .	shell 's plans are driven by the vast natural gas reserves in the marcellus shale , a formation that lies primarily beneath new york , pennsylvania , ohio and west virginia .	the marcellus shale is thought of as the nation 's largest-known natural gas reservoir , and has attracted the attention of some of the world 's largest energy companies and billions of dollars in investment already .	the main product at the proposed shell plant would be ethylene , which is used to produce chemicals that go into everything from plastics to tires to antifreeze .	workers would break apart the molecules of the raw gas so it can be turned into various products .	the industrial complex would then likely attract many smaller , specialized chemical plants , the american chemistry council has said .	royal dutch shell in 2010 bought a pennsylvania-based drilling company , east resources inc. , for $ 4.7 billion in an effort to expand and improve its land holdings in shale gas territories in north america .
no actor or actress can match meryl streep 's 19 academy award nominations , and only katharine hepburn has bested her three oscars for acting .	so maybe it 's conceivable that streep 's letter tuesday to each member of the u.s. congress can somehow revive the equal rights amendment , politically dormant since its high-water mark four decades ago . "	i am writing to ask you to stand up for equality - for your mother , your daughter , your sister , your wife or yourself - by actively supporting the equal rights amendment , " streep writes .	each packet includes a copy of " equal means equal , " a book by jessica neuwirth , president of the era coalition .	congress passed the equal rights amendment in 1972 .	over the next decade , 35 states ratified it , three short of the 38 needed to add it to the u.s. constitution .	conservative opposition and other factors halted its momentum .	they have helped relegate the era to america 's political backburners ever since .	still , lawmakers from both parties regularly try to restart the process .	the proposed amendment states , " equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex . "	streep , who turned 66 on monday , is among numerous celebrities who say disparities between men 's and women 's average salaries are one reason the amendment remains relevant and needed . "	a whole new generation of women and girls are talking about equality - equal pay , equal protection from sexual assault , equal rights , " streep 's letter says .	advocates in hollywood and washington are battling the notion that the era is an artifact whose time has passed . "	the time is ripe to ratify the equal rights amendment , " says rep. jackie speier , a democrat . "	seventy percent of people polled think that we already have an era in the constitution , and they 're shocked to find we do n't have one .

at one time , there were nine one-room country schoolhouses dotting the byways and rolling farm pastures of gaines township .	today , there 's only one that has n't been destroyed by fire , demolished or converted into a private residence .	it stands sturdy as the day it was built on the northeast corner of 100th street se and east paris avenue . "	it was a good school , " said gerald kayser , a retired dairy farmer who started attending the 124-year-old detray school in the early 1930s as an elementary student . "	you got to be good friends with those kids in your grade . "	kayser , 85 , has lived and worked within walking distance of the school his entire life and fondly remembers being able to bolt from his home on 100th street at the sound of the school bell and be sitting at his desk before it finished ringing .	later , he purchased the building and used it to store feed before deeding it in 1990 to the gaines township historical society .	members view the old schoolhouse as a centerpiece acquisition around which they can continue to build their membership and functions in coming years .	since taking ownership , the society has tackled the historic restoration bit by bit , raising money to buy original-style desks as they can find them and bring the building up to code to use it for various functions .	community development block grant money in the 1990s helped immensely . "	it actually looks just like it did , " said shirley bruusema , president of the historical society .	the school was built in 1887 and remained a part of the caledonia school district until closing amid consolidation in 1960 .	it 's named for jackson b. de tray , an early area settler who purchased the land from the federal government in 1852 and donated it for a school .	before this structure was built , a log cabin school occupied the spot , with a dirt floor and de tray 's wife , charlotte , thought to be the first teacher .	the school had about 20 pupils in the early 1900s .	on the wall above the boys hall door were the words " knowledge is power , " and above the girls hall door , " strive to excel . "	female students would carry drinking water in pails from nearby farms , and the boys piled wood in the halls to feed the stove to heat the building , which bruusema said retains heat very well considering its wind-swept location amid acres of farmland .	when keyser was a student , class started at 9 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m. , with an hour for lunch and two 15 minute recess periods , where students amused themselves with games like " anne-i-over , " a tag-like game involving teams throwing a ball over the building .	the teacher began the day with 15 minutes of reading from a book by prolific 19th century author horatio alger , or a round of song-book singing . "	we did our arithmetic on slates with slate pencils , " wrote the late cora bauman of wayland in 1976 , who attended detray around 1910 .	for lessons in spelling , " instead of the teacher marking our test papers with a 's and b 's , we were marked with percentages , " she wrote .	friday afternoons were spelling bee contests .	teachers taught grades 1 through 8 , kayser said .	they were generally single women who boarded with nearby families and walked to school just like the students .	they changed often and rotated between the nearby schools .	the class being taught was brought up to a recitation bench in the front . "	all the students knew what was going on , and some of the younger students picked up on what the older kids were doing , " he said .	back then , country schools were used as a kind of rural community center and keyser remembers christmas programs and generous neighbors who donated wood for the stove and did landscaping , partly to keep operating costs and taxes down .	these days , the original blackboard adorns the wall , facing a restored chandelier hanging from the ceiling .	the original iron school bell was tracked down and returned in 2008 after 47 years in new york .	bruusema said the historical society , which recently formed as a 501c3 nonprofit , is hoping to bring in more students for visits when the windows and the floor finishing is completed .	the group hosted second grade students from dutton christian school in may .	students these days should know what school was like in the days of quill pens , strict discipline and outhouse bathrooms , she said , and " learn what it means to get an education while not having the amenities you have today .

a washington state woman who says she developed a " superbug " infection at a seattle hospital has filed a lawsuit against the maker of medical scopes linked to similar infections across the u.s. debbie newton , 54 , says she contracted the infection in 2013 while at harborview medical center for a routine procedure to treat gallstones , according to the seattle times ( http://bit.ly/19pbtti ) .	harborview officials say they have no record of the superbug cre , or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae , linked to the scopes , made by olympus america inc. .	the devices have been tied to an outbreak of multidrug-resistant infections that sickened dozens of people at seattle 's virginia mason medical center between 2012 and 2014 .	they also were linked to outbreaks in los angeles , pittsburgh and philadelphia .	the bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs and can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients .	on thursday , the federal food and drug administration said olympus issued new guidelines for cleaning the devices after tests showed company instructions did not demonstrate " an adequate safety margin . "	the fda previously had warned the devices could remain contaminated with bacteria even after being cleaned according to manufacturers ' instructions .	newton , of kirkland , claims that within hours of having her gallstone procedure , she was placed on life support due to " heart failure , respiratory failure , renal failure , pancreatitis , septic shock and bacteremia , " according to medical records cited in the complaint filed last week in the pennsylvania court of common pleas in philadelphia .	two years later , newton remains nearly incapacitated by infections caused by klebsiella , e. coli and enterococcus bacteria , the lawsuit said .	after hearing recent media reports about a rise in similar superbug cases , newton decided to sue .	harborview officials said a review of hospital cases from january 2013 to the present showed no cre infections tied to scopes after the procedure known as ercp , or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography .	state health officials say they have no record of any cre infections reported by harborview during that time .	the lawsuit , filed by the mceldrew young firm of philadelphia , seeks about $ 200,000 in damages from olympus , the pennsylvania manufacturer of most of the scopes used in some 500,000 procedures in the u.s. annually .	it claims the scope used in newton 's procedure had a design flaw and said olympus failed to seek fda approval for a new version that included changes that make it impossible to clean correctly , raising the risk of spreading infection .	olympus spokesman mark miller did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
the moratorium approved by the policymaking board of regents in albany was recommended by gov. andrew cuomo 's common core task force last week and has been vigorously sought by teachers for much longer .	the measure sets up a transition period during which grades 3-8 math and reading scores will be used only on an advisory basis , rather than as a key component of annual performance reviews that can lead to teacher firings .	in the meantime , the state is expected to fulfill other task force recommendations to rewrite the common core learning standards and tests with input from new york teachers . "	those recommendations opened the door for substantive change and an end to the state 's test-and-punish mentality , " said a statement from the new york state united teachers union , which called the moratorium " an initial step . "	cuomo created the task force after an unprecedented 20 percent of new york public school students sat out of this year 's statewide tests in protest of the high-stakes assessments and their toll on classroom time .	anxiety over the tests has grown since their alignment to the higher common core standards that have been adopted by most states with a goal of better preparing students for college .	scores dropped dramatically with the first common core tests in 2012-13 and have changed little since then .	about 31 percent of new york students scored proficient in english in april and about 38 percent were considered proficient in math .	at the same time , the state has moved to give more weight to student performance on the tests in mandatory annual teacher evaluations .	without the moratorium , assessments could count for as much as half of a teacher 's grade .	a teachers group , educators 4 excellence , has argued for a cap of 35 percent for both state and local tests in evaluations , with the majority of a teacher 's score to be based on the principal 's observation .	co-founder evan stone said in a statement tuesday , " as new york considers its next step , it 's important to remember what teachers really want , a system with high-quality tests and other metrics that can provide reliable and timely feedback for teachers about their work and give them a path to keep improving for their students . "	a delay is something teachers want , " he said , " but is only helpful if it gets us to a place where all teachers feel that their evaluations are helping them to grow .

democratic gov. beverly perdue was to meet with education leaders on monday to discuss what the budget approved by lawmakers two days earlier would mean for schools and universities if enacted .	perdue scheduled a late afternoon meeting in greenville with education leaders from pitt and beaufort counties to talk about what the $ 19.7 billion given final legislative approval on saturday .	earlier in the day , she talked with reporters about the budget in asheville , where she had a private economic recruitment meeting .	perdue spokeswoman chrissy pearson said she wo n't announce any decision monday about the budget .	she has until june 14 to decide whether to veto the budget , sign it into law or let it become law without her signature .	gop leaders appear to have a veto-proof majority if five house democrats who voted for the plan in two votes friday and saturday keep supporting it .	pearson said the governor plans to review every part of the budget before making her decision .	perdue said saturday she was " prepared to veto this budget if my review indeed shows what i fear ?	that north carolina will move backwards under this budget plan . "	during the greenville event , perdue will ask officials for their input and concerns about how the budget will affect local schools , pearson said .	state educators argue the budget would eliminate more than 13,000 education positions , including nearly 9,300 in the public schools .	republicans have said that the total is exaggerated and that thousands of educators retire annually .	the measure also allows temporary sales and income taxes to expire on time , which gop leaders say will help create jobs by freeing up $ 1.3 billion that would have otherwise gone into the state 's coffers next year .	perdue and other democrats have said keeping a portion of the sales tax on the books a little longer would eliminate the need for large government layoffs and protect north carolina 's public schools and university and community college systems .

it 's difficult to describe bryan swinney 's pets as cuddly or loving .	aside from the lack of a neocortex or limbic brain for emotions , there 's the matter of their tough hides and sharp teeth that are likely to bite the hand that feeds them ?	chilly dispositions to match their coldblooded bodies .	bearded dragons , on the other hand , are fun to watch amble across their cages , and many snakes ' scale patterns are simply beautiful .	argentine horned frogs remind swinney of jabba the hutt from the star wars movie series .	swinney knows it 's the alien appearances and behaviors that his customers find intriguing and keep alligator alley in business as one of the largest multi-species herpetology retailers in oklahoma .	he was hooked as a child when he played with a harmless brown snake that his father had brought home , swinney said .	or it might have been even earlier , when he was bitten by a copperhead when he was about 2 years old , he said with a laugh . "	there was n't any envenomation , but they still took me to the hospital for all the checkups , " he said . "	so i guess you could say it 's in my blood .	or it just did n't affect me . "	swinney opened alligator alley in 1988 as an extension of his own hobby love for " herps , " the shorthand reference for herpetology , which includes amphibian and reptile species .	market demand over time required that he expand his stock to include a few other small animals , such as mexican red rump tarantulas , giant millipedes , sulcata tortoises and emperor scorpions .	guinea pigs and lop-eared bunnies are sold as pets as well , kept separate from other warmblooded mice and rats that are kept as food stock .	alligator alley , 4636 n.w. 10th st. in oklahoma city , is also a major player in local iguana rescue efforts .	iguanas are one of the more popular animals that allow people to dabble in herp culture before they get bored or admit they were n't prepared for the reptiles ' environmental and diet needs .	alligator alley receives five to 10 calls each week from people trying to get rid of their pets , he said .	swinney buys most of his animals from local specialty breeders .	some of the species he can breed himself , such as bearded dragons , boa constrictors and corn snakes .	widespread access to zoological research has made breeding now as simple as following a recipe , he said .	and inbreeding risks are n't as widespread yet in the herpetology field as with dogs and cats , he said . "	we 'll keep around a few animals for supplemental breeding of our own so that we can respond to the market , " he said . "	when the interest and price goes up on bearded dragons , for example , we need to be able to access them quickly . "	bearded dragons are among the species that swinney said he would suggest for a beginner herp pet owner , as well as ball pythons and leopard geckos .	one of his largest animals , a water monitor weighing about 15 pounds , requires a little more handling experience .
the request by democrats barbara boxer of california and sheldon whitehouse of rhode island and independent bernard sanders of vermont builds on increased public concern about nuclear safety in recent months ?	an outcry unlike anything since the chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 .	public interest first spiked after the march accident at the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear plant in japan .	concern has been heightened this week as the ap began releasing the results of a yearlong investigation into aging related safety problems at the 104 reactors operating in the united states .	that 's led activists , politicians , critics and safety watchdogs to say they hope to turn the public focus more sharply onto the industry in america and broader regulatory problems at the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission .	one after another , they said they hope the result will be tougher relicensing and safety standards , safer storage of spent fuel and better disaster planning .	janet tauro , of brick , new jersey , co-founder of grandmothers , mothers , and more for energy safety who lives near the oyster creek nuclear plant , said the latest developments have led her to conclude " the light is really starting to shine on a very closed regulatory agency . "	senators boxer , whitehouse and sanders asked for the oversight investigation by the government accountability office .	boxer chairs the senate committee on environment and public works .	new jersey 's two democratic senators , frank r. lautenberg and robert menendez , made a similar request of the gao earlier this week .	in recent months , public anxiety over nuclear power has " peaked incredibly , " said engineer paul blanch , an industry whistleblower who later returned to work on improving safety .	he is now fighting relicensing applications at four sites . "	i was fighting the world , and now i 'm only fighting half the world , " blanch said .	visits to the website of fairewinds associates , a nuclear safety consultant in burlington , vermont , have exploded from about 80 a day to 7,000 since the japanese accident , according to chief engineer , arnie gundersen .	site visits rose about another 10 percent when the ap series started on monday .	the ap 's four-part investigative series shows that government and industry have been working in tandem to weaken safety standards to keep aging reactors within the rules .	the series also found that there have been leaks of radioactive tritium , often from corroded underground piping , at three-quarters of u.s. commercial nuclear power sites .	in a gao report released tuesday by democratic reps. edward j. markey of massachusetts and peter welch of vermont , the watchdog agency concluded that nuclear power plant operators have n't figured out how to quickly find the underground leaks , which often go undetected for years .	the ap series , which continues next week with an examination of explosive population growth around the 65 sites that house the reactors , comes three months after a tsunami born from an earthquake caused a nuclear crisis at the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear complex in japan .	the march 11 natural disaster swamped backup generators , disabled cooling systems , caused fuel melts and explosions , and released vast amounts of radiation into the grounds and sea .	the nrc has said it disagrees with ap 's conclusions , but welcomes the attention the stories have generated to nuclear plant safety .	the agency defended its standards and approach to safety .	the industry 's nuclear energy institute criticized ap 's overall findings and " selective , misleading reporting " on u.s. nuclear power plant safety .	public concern about nuclear safety reached a zenith after the three mile island accident in 1979 and chernobyl .	however , public interest has slipped since initial rounds of safety improvements after those accidents .	originally licensed for 40 years , 66 of u.s. 104 reactors have been relicensed for another two decades .	safety regulators at the nrc have never denied a request .	few requests have met much opposition .	and 16 relicensing applications are pending .	randy voller , mayor of the small town of pittsboro , north carolina , said people are now more focused both on existing plants and where new ones might be located .	his town lies just beyond the 10-mile ( 16-kilometer ) zone where evacuation plans have been made for an accident at the shearon harris nuclear plant . "	there plants were n't made to last forever , " he said . "	we are more aware of the risks than we were before . "	steven kerekes , a spokesman for the nuclear energy institute , said heightened public concern is " understandable , " given the japanese accident and heavy news coverage .	but he said the relicensing process , which can take years , is " properly focused , " that fire requirements are already strict , and the industry has been moving spent fuel into dry storage since the mid-1980s .	despite such assurances , safety activists are laying plans to mobilize the public .	the website of beyond nuclear , an anti-nuclear group , has been bombarded with tens of thousands of additional visitors in recent months , according to paul gunter , the group 's director of reactor oversight .	he said nuclear safety has primarily concerned specialists in recent years . "	now it 's mothers and housewives who are concerned about fallout from fukushima and from reactors in their own neighborhood , " gunter said .	tauro said an independent safety assessment ?	beyond that of the nrc ?	should be carried out before any other reactors are relicensed .	she said no federal loan guarantees should be offered to new reactors .	bernard weinstein , associate director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university , predicted an eventual tightening of regulations as a result of the public pressure .	bill corcoran , president of nuclear safety review concepts corp. in windsor , connecticut , and other safety analysts have argued that plants need better designs for fire protection , more spent fuel stored inside dry casks instead of cooling pools , and planning that anticipates more severe fires , earthquakes , tsunamis , tornados and extended power outages ?	and combinations of them .	alarmed by the ap findings on tritium , annette quijano , a member of the new jersey state assembly , said she 's drafting a legislative resolution asked for stronger federal oversight of the state 's four commercial nuclear reactors . "	our reactors are obviously not aging well and it would seem that it is only a matter of time until the public is put at serious risk due to a structural failure , a natural disaster or , god forbid , an act of terror , " she said .	relicensing requests are pending at the hope creek and salem plants in new jersey .	joe delmar , spokesman for owner pse&g nuclear , said the nrc is already " a very strict regulator . "	he said the agency has extensively reviewed the company 's plan to maintain aging systems .	nrc chairman gregory jaczko has defended his agency as an effective regulator but also hinted at improvements .	the commission expects to issue a report in july on a broad review of safety undertaken in the wake of the japanese accident .	speaking tuesday in vienna , jaczko said plants are safe but added : " i believe there is a likelihood that the agency will need to make some changes . "	he cited several problem areas that fed the disaster in japan : extended power outages , spent fuel pools and emergency planning .
south carolina officials are considering pardoning a black man executed a century ago in the death of a white shopkeeper .	the state 's probation , parole and pardon services board on wednesday is hearing the request to grant a posthumous pardon to daniel " nealy " duncan .	investigators questioned a half-dozen blacks but could n't find a suspect until two weeks later , when the shopkeeper 's widow was attacked in the same store .	two white men grabbed duncan , who was walking near the store as the woman staggered out .	duncan was executed in 1911 .	author and former cbs news producer batt humphreys says duncan was railroaded by police .	he filed the pardon request and says he hopes duncan 's exoneration will foster a dialogue about similar cases .
doug fasick , a senior program manager for engineering with fort wayne utilities , said the plant started using methane gas on oct. 22 .	the water pollution control plant then saw electric costs drop from about $ 110,000 to $ 68,000 , the ( fort wayne ) journal gazette reported ( http://bit.ly/1op5st4 ) .	a timeline for the savings was n't provided , and city officials did n't immediately respond to an email sent friday afternoon .	methane supplements about 32 percent of the plant 's energy needs .	the city 's goal is to use gas to power most if not all plant operations .	since the city started using methane gas , it has reduced its monthly energy consumption from about 1.6 million kilowatt-hours to just over 1 million kilowatt-hours , fasick said . "	at our plant , we have anaerobic digestion , which produces methane gas , " fasick said . "	we 're capturing that methane gas and running it through two generators that are 400 kilowatts each .	they 're essentially supplementing our power needs for the water pollution control plant . "	another bonus is that the minimizing the plant 's electrical costs helps keeping sewage rates stable for consumers , fasick said .	the city started trying to reduce the amount of methane gas it released in 2013 , as part of a consent decree with the environmental protection agency .	the city realized during that process that it could use the gas to power certain plant operations .	city officials now hope to bring in additional waste streams that can help create more methane gas .

a federal initiative designed to encourage homeowners to improve energy efficiency has had little participation in kansas .	some energy auditors hope a partnership proposal from westar energy inc. could save the state program .	since the state was awarded the stimulus money last november , only 58 kansas residents have sought loans for projects such as sealing windows and doors , insulation and new windows , the lawrence journal-world reported monday .	the program , called efficiency kansas , allows homeowners to take out up to $ 20,000 for energy efficiency projects .	the 38 loans have used about $ 386,000 of the $ 38 million , which the state must spend by april 2012 .	until now , the state has partnered with banks and smaller utilities but set no stipulations on how banks lend the money .	many of the banks require homeowners to take out a second mortgage , have a high credit score and 20 percent or more equity in their home .	the loans also came with a 4 percent interest rate .	lawrence home energy auditor j.r. demby , owner of the demby group , has been a critic of the program . "	even with the program being drastically changed , if a utility is n't on board , i do n't care how you parse it , it 's not going to work , " demby said .	most people will not take out a second mortgage to get improvements made , even with the low interest rate , he said .	westar is proposing a plan to charge a $ 240 fee and allow consumers to take out a loan through the utility and repay it through their energy bill .	westar would n't charge interest and if the house sold , the new occupants would make payments on the loan through their energy bill .	not everyone supports the plan .	david springe , consumer counsel for the citizens ' utility ratepayer board , said he does n't like that westar customers will cover the revenue the utility will lose through lower energy use caused by the home upgrades .	efficiency kansas programs manager ryan freed said fewer than six official jobs have been created under the funding .	but he notes the state now has 78 certified energy auditors ; it previously had 10 . "	our ultimate goal is to give this program over to the private sector , " freed said . "	so it took some working and negotiating with the members of the lending community and the utility companies and the auditors and different contractors out there to figure out how we can best position them to get this program up and running . "	demby , however , thinks westar 's proposal might be the only chance for the program to succeed . "	i think this is as close as it is ever going to get to finally showing some fruit of life , " he said .

"	he really was the most proud of his association with the community health center movement , " kennedy said during the ceremony under a drizzling sky . "	rather than being a reminder of his loss , it 's actually been very comforting and gratifying to know that he really touched so many people in so many ways . "	the senator died a year ago at age 77 from brain cancer .	he had spent 47 years in the senate .	the year since kennedy 's death has seen big changes in the political landscape of massachusetts and in the kennedy family .	kennedy 's other son , u.s. rep. patrick kennedy , a democrat from rhode island , who checked himself into rehab in june 2009 , has had a tumultuous year .	last fall , he got into a public spat with providence roman catholic bishop thomas tobin following kennedy 's criticism of the church 's opposition to health care overhaul legislation over abortion funding .	that began a weeks-long argument with tobin culminating in the revelation that the bishop had asked kennedy in 2007 to stop taking holy communion because of the catholic congressman 's support for abortion rights .	in february , patrick kennedy said he would not seek a ninth term in congress after spending roughly half his life in elected office .	in massachusetts , the race to fill kennedy 's senate seat ended in a surprise when a republican scott brown defeated democrat martha coakley in part by pledging to vote against president barack obama 's health care overhaul .	kennedy had called the expansion of health care his life 's work . "	i have great respect for his service to our state , " brown told reporters wednesday . "	my feelings and thoughts go out to the kennedy family . "

"	it 's hard to put into words our disappointment and sense of injustice over this decision , " said dr. maureen hackett , founder of howling for wolves .	the group contended the dnr set its rules in a way that minimized public input .	the organization is now evaluating its options for further court action after this second setback , said hackett , a forensic psychiatrist and former air force officer .	minnesota resumed sport hunting and trapping after the region 's wolves came off the endangered species list early last year .	hunters and trappers then killed 413 wolves during the state 's first wolf season , which ended in january .	the dnr plans to make decisions about a 2013 hunt this summer after a population survey is completed , said ed boggess , director of the fish and wildlife division .	boggess said the agency is committed to balancing the hunt with long-term sustainability goals . "	we manage wolf seasons like we manage seasons for dozens of other game species , " he said .	legislation seeking to impose a five-year moratorium on wolf hunts stalled during the legislature 's just-completed session .
warren buffett 's company is defending its decision not to write down the value of its investments in kraft foods , us bancorp and other stocks even though they were worth nearly $ 1.9 billion less at the end of 2009 than what berkshire hathaway inc. paid for them .	on monday , berkshire disclosed several letters it exchanged with the securities and exchange commission between april and september about its 2009 annual report .	the sec asked why berkshire had n't adjusted the value of its stock holdings to reflect losses that had lasted more than 12 months .	berkshire officials said they 're confident kraft and us bancorp stock will rebound within a couple years , and berkshire is willing to hold the stocks long enough for them to recover .
state sen. karen spilka was named wednesday to chair the powerful senate ways and means committee , a position that will give the ashland democrat significant influence in state budget negotiations with the house and republican gov. charlie baker in the weeks and months ahead .	senate president stanley rosenberg also named worcester democrat harriette chandler to serve as senate majority leader , the position rosenberg held before he was unanimously elected by democrats earlier this month to succeed former senate president therese murray .	spilka is beginning her sixth term in the senate after previously serving in the house .	she is a graduate of cornell university and northeastern university school of law . "	she 's a strong negotiator , a good listener , " rosenberg said of spilka after a private meeting with democrats . "	you 've got to have a lot of stamina and patience and she has both in abundance . "	the ways and means committee is responsible for drafting the senate version of the more than $ 36 billion state budget for the fiscal year that begins july 1 .	as chairwoman , spilka would participate in negotiations leading to the final version of the spending plan .	more immediately , spilka will be a key player in discussions about how to close what baker said tuesday was a $ 765 million deficit in the budget for the current fiscal year .	baker has blamed the shortfall on a " spending problem " in state government .	spilka succeeds former ways and means chairman stephen brewer , who also retired from the senate .	in a statement , spilka said she is grateful to rosenberg for putting his faith in her and promised not to take the assignment lightly . "	i will work hard every day with my colleagues to assist our communities and help raise up all of the residents of massachusetts , " she said .	chandler in 2001 became the first woman from worcester to be elected to the state senate after serving three terms in the house .	in assembling his leadership team rosenberg also named three assistant majority leaders : sen. cynthia creem , d-newton ; sen. mark montigny , d-new bedford , and sen. brian joyce , d-milton .	in a break from tradition , rosenberg said all three assistant majority leaders will also chair senate committees .	the chamber on wednesday also approved several changes in its operating rules that rosenberg said would increase transparency .	one change would require the senate to post an agenda on the legislature 's website at least 48 hours in advance of upcoming sessions , rather than one day in advance as the rule previously stated .	republicans also won passage of a rules change that will require roll call votes in committees to be posted online within 48 hours .
officials at los angeles international airport say a $ 140 million baggage screening facility in its recently remodeled international terminal has only been able to process luggage at about half the intended rate .	deputy airport director roger johnson tells the los angeles times ( http://lat.ms/gzqhrv ) on monday that the facility intended to screen more than 3,200 pieces of luggage an hour has instead been clearing between 1,500 and 1,800 bags .	the system uses a complex system of conveyors , but johnson blames the problem on inadequate operational procedures instead of mechanical difficulties .	johnson says that at rare but problematic peak travel times bags have had to be sent to another terminal to be screened .	the problem could worsen when the terminal 's continued renovations bring two new concourses and six new gates in 2013 .
vermont lawmakers have passed a key milepost in their 2014 session , and are tallying up progress to date and work still to do in the remaining weeks on the legislative calendar .	friday was crossover day in the legislature , when most bills were expected to have emerged from their initial committees if their backers want to see them pass this year .	bills to combat a crisis of opiate drug abuse in vermont , to promote the development of new homegrown renewable energy through " net metering , " and to ban hand-held electronics like cell phones while driving already have passed at least one chamber ?	in the case of net metering , both the house and senate .	the house still must concur with senate changes on the net metering bill , but lawmakers said that should n't be a problem . "	i think we 're going to put a bill on the governor 's desk that promotes renewable energy and deals with climate change , " said house speaker shap smith .	among items still to be worked out are adjustments to vermont 's school funding system .	the house ways and means committee is expected to complete work on a bill this coming week setting statewide property tax rates at 99 cents per $ 100 of value for residential properties and $ 1.52 for commercial and vacation properties .	ways and means and other money committees are exempted from the crossover deadline .	one challenge faced by lawmakers in the coming weeks will be crafting a budget without the $ 14 million in increases sought by gov. peter shumlin in january .	the ways and means committee has been balking at passing the increase in a tax on health insurance claims that shumlin wanted to use to pay for the increases .	smith called the ban on hand-held devices , which is currently in the senate , and a separate measure to crack down on driving while under the influence of drugs " pretty important public safety bills .

they never dreamed she 'd get to see rome someday .	elizabeth " lizzy " myers and her family will travel to italy sometime next spring thanks to turkish airlines , whose general manager was touched by the little girl 's story and her parents ' wish that she see many amazing things before a rare genetic condition robs her of her sight , or most of it .	the airline offered up round-trip tickets to anywhere in the world , and the family -- from bellville , ohio , 60 miles north of columbus -- chose one of the most visual places they could think of . "	my wife 's family is italian , and we 're catholic , so rome was kind of the obvious choice for us , " said lizzy 's dad , steve myers , 42 . "	we felt both felt lizzy would enjoy seeing the artwork and the statues , and possibly seeing where my wife 's family is from , which is south of rome . "	lizzy was recently diagnosed with usher syndrome type ii , which causes hearing and progressive vision loss .	her parents have five to seven years to get her out to see things , especially at night .	recently she visited an observatory near their home and saw a production of " mary poppins " at a local theater .	they also hope to take a road trip soon to show her some of america 's natural wonders , including yellowstone national park , yosemite and the grand canyon .	and now rome is on the list . "	this was about helping a little girl who may never have the chance to see the world , " turkish airlines ' general manager tuncay eminoglu said .	steve myers said he was uneasy and reluctant when people started coming forward and offering money and other things to the family after their story was first featured in the mansfield news journal last week .	but he said they could n't pass up the chance to take lizzy somewhere they could n't have visited otherwise . "	it 's the simple stuff more so than the extravagant , but we just hope to do the extravagant here and there , " he said . "	we 're just trying to cram as many things in her mind as possible . "	for lizzy 's part , she does n't know what is beginning to happen to her sight , and her parents have n't attempted to explain it to the happy little girl who 's still deciding if she wants to be a princess or a mermaid when she grows up .	the family -- including mom christine and a little sister -- is at hilton head , south carolina , for a vacation this week , so next up on the bucket list : a sunrise at the beach .
authorities investigating an unusual uptick of bald and golden eagle killings across utah over the past two years are offering a $ 2,500 reward for information leading to successful prosecutions .	the eagles , which are protected under two separate federal laws , have been found in multiple counties across the state since 2010 . "	to have this many in one place , it 's unique , " said tom tidwell , resident agent in charge for the u.s. fish and wildlife service in utah and colorado . "	it certainly has our attention . "	tidwell said a typical year may see roughly three eagles killed in utah or surrounding states , so the increase in fatalities has authorities perplexed . "	it certainly looks like an uptick , " he said monday . "	it 's always going to get our attention whether it 's one eagle or multiple eagles , but there 's just a lot of unsolved cases right now . "	some of the birds have been shot to death , while others suffered from poisoning , likely unintentional but illegal nonetheless .	authorities do n't believe all the deaths are connected , and there 's no evidence linking the killings to native american ceremonies . "	these are just random killings that are not necessarily related to each other in most instances , " said capt. tony wood of the utah division of wildlife resources . "	we do n't see necessarily any trend here that we have a group of people out killing eagles . "	several indian tribes have been allowed permits to kill golden eagles for religious purposes , but many get feathers that are used in ceremonies from a federal repository that collects birds already found dead . "	we 're not seeing where these birds are losing feathers , where we would suspect they 're being used in ceremonies , " wood said .	both birds are protected under the federal bald and golden eagle protection act and the migratory bird treaty act .	violations of each statute can carry penalties of up to $ 100,000 and up to a year in prison .	dwr lt. jodi becker recalls one case well .	it happened in january just up the road from her home in utah county .	a neighbor heard two shots and stepped outside onto their property to find a golden eagle in a field and a white suv speeding away .	becker got the call but arrived too late .	the vehicle was gone , and the bird was dead , hit twice with a small caliber rifle . "	she was resting in an open field , " becker recalled . "	she was not mistaken for anything else .	they were using the eagle as target practice . "	becker said she examined the scene just as if a person had been killed , collecting evidence and bullet casings , documenting footprints and taking photographs , but the case remains unsolved . "	hopefully someone will come forward , " she said . "	it 's extremely disheartening . "
dina loor knows the dangers of police work all too personally ?	her detective husband was stabbed in the head and nearly killed on duty last year .	but on friday , she took her place among the nearly 1,200 new officers being sworn in .	with her still-recovering husband by her side , loor smiled as she spoke afterward about achieving a longtime goal of joining the force .	she said she first applied three years ago , before her husband was attacked while responding to a call about an emotionally disturbed man in april 2012 .	the man plunged a switch blade into then-officer eder loor 's head , fracturing his skull and hitting his brain .	he was promoted to detective in march .	dina loor said the attack made her think about her own plans to join the police , but it did n't deter her . "	we ca n't live in fear , and that 's something i have learned .	you have to continue and succeed in life , " she said after friday 's ceremony at madison square garden .	it was the last police academy graduation presided over by mayor michael bloomberg and police commissioner raymond kelly , who have steered the city 's approach to public safety together for 12 years ; kelly also was police commissioner from 1992 to 1994 , under mayor david dinkins .	during the bloomberg-kelly years , crime has dropped to record lows as police also helped beat back the threat of terror that loomed over the city after 9/11 .	some ethnic and religious minorities have complained that some of the nypd 's crime-fighting and anti-terror techniques have compromised civil liberties ; kelly and bloomberg have said the tactics are legal and necessary and have made the city safer .	the 1,171 graduates include immigrants from 45 different countries , about 90 military veterans , about 460 people with college degrees and a few dozen with law or other advanced degrees .	although minorities made up a slight majority of the last academy graduates , in july , this class is 56 percent white .	it roughly mirrors last december 's class .	overall , the department has become more diverse in the last 12 years .	now , nearly half of officers are minorities , as are most city residents . "	we 're proud that , in a place that 's home to people of every background , every faith , every outlook and every orientation , we have police officers who reflect our city 's diversity , " bloomberg said .	bloomberg leaves office dec. 31 , and mayor-elect bill de blasio has tapped former police commissioner william bratton to return as the city 's top cop .	kelly is set to give speeches and be a visiting fellow with the council on foreign relations .	as he looked out at the new officers friday , he reflected on his own police academy graduation 47 years before .

the obama administration says cash-strapped states can make some medicaid cuts , but not deep ones .	the health and human services department said friday that states can raise premiums and drop a limited number of low-income adults from the rolls .	the changes stop well short of demands by republican governors to scale back medicaid enrollment to help balance their budgets .	the new health care overhaul generally requires states to keep current eligibility rules .	the administration now says states can raise premiums to reflect inflation , which might discourage some people from signing up .	and states can drop coverage for adults making over $ 14,484 , but not if those beneficiaries are pregnant or disabled .	only a small number of states now provide that coverage .	advocates for low-income people praised the decision .
the dry weather that has lasted for weeks across southern and central indiana is doing more than leaving yards brown and fields vulnerable to fires .	experts say it is causing possibly severe damage to trees throughout the area .	open burning restrictions have been issued in dozens of counties , and the national weather service has classified the southern half of the state as under severe or moderate drought .	the little rainfall the area has seen since early summer has n't been enough to keep trees healthy , said nick rush , the columbus city arborist and the city 's park operations director .	the columbus parks department , which looks after more than 600 acres of trees , has had a worker whose sole responsibility has been watering trees since july 1 , rush told the republic newspaper . "	the thing that 's really going to be critical for us is getting the moisture before winter , " he said . "	we 've never had to water this much . "	the tinder-dry conditions have contributed to numerous brush and field fires breaking out across the state , with a mile-long field fire thursday in rush county of central indiana briefly forcing about 75 people from homes before the blaze was put out .	another fire in southern indiana 's spencer county that burned more than 100 acres thursday was blamed on a combine spitting sparks from a stone stuck inside .	the state department of homeland security on friday listed burn bans in at least 48 of indiana 's 92 counties .	all the state roughly south of interstate 70 is experiencing severe or moderate drought , with the weather service saying the worst conditions are in indiana 's southeastern counties .	the weather service has recorded less than an inch of rain in indianapolis since aug. 1 , with about 1.5 inches in bloomington during that same time .	associate state climatologist ken scheeringa said a strong high pressure center over the southeastern states was to blame for indiana 's dry spell . "	what happens is that pressure center gets so strong and so broad that it pretty much routes storms north of indiana , " scheeringa said . "	so the storms we do get tend to be light and have very little rainfall , and we kind of miss ( big storms ) over and over . "	jim eagleman , a department of natural resources naturalist for brown county , said trees ' natural response to drought is to drop their leaves , which use a significant amount of moisture .	in particular , tulip poplar and maple trees , whose leaves change to saturated yellows and oranges in the fall , have been dropping their leaves earlier than usual , he said . "	i 'm not sure what the end result will be , " eagleman said . "	whether these trees will show colors typical to fall my guess is the color will be a little off . "	kris medic , president of the indiana arborist association , said the weeks of drought could hurt trees for two or three years by killing off feeder roots .	the early dropping of leaves also hurts the ability of trees to store food through the winter and then survive the next period of weather-related stress , rush said . "	based on my experience , next summer we could see some trees dying , " he said .
both the chicago school board and the city 's teachers union have rejected a fact finder 's recommendation to give teachers a double-digit raise .	the board voted 6-0 wednesday to reject the recommendation , and about an hour later the chicago teachers union 's house of delegates also unanimously rejected the report , citing classroom quality issues .	despite the apparent impasse , chicago board of education president david vitale says he 's optimistic that school district leaders and the teachers union can reach a deal .	the board and the teachers union now have 30 days in which to reach a deal before teachers would be able to strike .	earlier wednesday , chicago schools ceo jean-claude brizard told reporters the two sides have continued to negotiate while the fact finder , edwin benn , prepared his report .

a lawmaker is drafting legislation to require missouri universities create statewide tests for school children .	state rep. david wood on tuesday said creating new tests in the state will help prevent teachers from instructing children based on common core standards .	those standards outline goals for student learning in each grade , such as when to learn division .	they were adopted to create consistent , high-quality standards for education nationwide , but some missouri lawmakers say they take control of education away from the state .	work groups are reviewing those standards and could recommend that the state board of education nix them in october .	wood says drafting standardized tests in missouri would prevent educators from teaching current standards in order to get students to pass a test aligned with common core .
according to summit county rescue group mission coordinator dan burnett , if you 're going to go up on a mountain and get seriously hurt , summit county is the place to do it . "	the summit county rescue group is one of the most active mountain rescue groups in the united states , " he said . "	we have several things we can be proud of , and one of the biggest things we have to be proud of is the relationship we have with the summit county ambulance service .	when we have calls that require a higher level of medical need , we can take paramedics with us that bridge that gap significantly ?	to the point where it makes the difference between life or death . "	the summit county ambulance wilderness paramedics are comprised of fully certified paramedics from the ambulance service who work in conjunction with scrg .	members go through training with both organizations : they must pass the rescue team 's rigorous six-week training process , as well as obtain additional medical training in backcountry medicine from the scas .	marc burdick , director of scas and the paramedic arm of search and rescue , said members tend to already have backgrounds in wilderness medicine through past experiences as ski patrollers , rafting guides or backcountry guides .	the group was formed in 1994 .	tom resignolo , now the ems coordinator at st. anthony summit medical center , was one of the first members ?	one of only four .	he said the group formed after a few calls to the scrg that required advanced life support in the field .	both a paramedic and a member of the rescue group at the time , he said other scrg members appreciated his paramedic knowledge ( scrg members have a cpr certification and advanced first aid training ) and set up protocols for ambulance service members to become trained in backcountry rescues . "	we did n't really want to have paramedics just jumping off the ambulance and hiking five miles in , " burdick said . "	maybe they did n't have the right footwear , they were n't prepared for overnight or they did n't have the right clothing or food .	( search and rescue ) wanted people who were prepared . " "	since then it 's been a great alliance , " resignolo said .	wilderness paramedics are n't deployed to every scrg mission , but only those with known injuries or avalanches with a possible burial .	burdick said they probably average about 20 missions a year , compared with scrg 's 120 .	they will also accompany the rescue group if they 're searching for someone with a known medical problem , like a diabetic .	and when paramedics do arrive in the backcountry , their biggest task is usually pain management .	they 're authorized to start an iv 10 miles into the woods , even if they ca n't get in touch with the hospital first to approve it . "	it does n't just benefit the patient ; the mission itself goes better , " burdick said . "	if the patient 's more comfortable , it helps the whole search and rescue team run the mission . "	burdick said paramedics also carry special concerns into the backcountry ; they have medicine that needs to be kept warm , and equipment that needs to be maintained .	when burnett said summit county is the best place to get injured in the backcountry , it 's because most rescue groups do n't have paramedics accompanying them . "	our program is regarded as one of the first in the state and the country , " burdick said .	eagle county now has a similar group , but are studying summit 's to see how they operate . "	we have calls that are oftentimes intense , " burnett said .	and that little bit extra the summit county paramedics provide " absolutely makes a difference of life and death . "	burnett said a few years ago , a woman in a snowmobile accident was saved by the paramedics ' presence .	she was " within two minutes of death , " and would n't have survived the ride to the hospital without early intervention . "	we do not take them for granted , " burnett said . "	the ambulance service makes a significant difference ; it costs them to provide that program to us . " "	we dedicate equipment , training time and staff time to making the program work , " burdick said . "	we work in support of the search and rescue team . "	resignolo is no longer a member , but said he misses being out on the field . "	it 's a unique experience , it 's an opportunity to use our skills to some advantage to help people , " burdick said . "	it 's a challenging environment , so there is some enjoyment to the challenge .	it 's nice to help people and make them more comfortable . "	burdick said one of his most memorable missions was a few years back , when a woman broke her femur skiing above janet 's cabin .	the weather was so bad by the time she was rescued ?	around midnight ?	the group had to extricate her to the cabin for the night and provide pain medication before a helicopter could complete the rescue in the morning .	matt schultz , a wilderness paramedic for six months now , said he joined the ambulance service a year-and-a-half ago after working for ski patrol .	and while he has n't been able to go on a mission yet , he feels good about being available to help those injured enjoying the same place he loves ?	the backcountry .
@ by jeff martin usa today sioux falls , s.d. - a giant chunk of hail that plunged into the prairie town of vivian , s.d. , on july 23 was confirmed friday as the heaviest hailstone ever recorded in the united states .	the national climate extremes committee , a branch of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration .	confirmed the weight of a record 1.94 pounds and also a record diameter ( 8 inches ) .	the previous heaviest - a hailstone stone that fell in coffeyville , kan. , on sept. 3 , 1970 .	- was 1.67 pounds , .	according to records from the national climatic data center . "	i 've been in the weather business for 20 years now and i 've never seen a hailstone as large , " says jim scarlett , meteorologist in charge at the national weather service in aberdeen , s.d. " i described this one as cantaloupe-size . "	the world record belongs to a 2.25-pound hailstone that fell in bangladesh on april 14 , 1986 , according to paul hudspetha , a meteorologist at the national climatic data center in asheville , n.c. leslie scott , a ranch hand , found the bunyan-esque chunk of ice after it fell outside his central south dakota home . "	the only reason i went out and picked this one up is because it had a whole bunch of fingers sticking out of it , " he said . "	these would take your head off ... they were wicked . "	but a power outage warmed the freezer a bit , scott said , and he also opened it a few times to let neighbors marvel at the hailstone , so there may have been some melting , he said .	while the vivian hailstone was confirmed as the heaviest and largest in diameter , its 18.5-inch circumference fell just shy of that record , scarlett said .	a hailstone that fell in aurora , neb. in 2003 measured 18.75 inches in circumference , according to national climatic data center records .	the hailstone is on its way to the national center for atmospheric research in boulder , colo. , where scientists will store it in a cold lab and study its growth rings and other traits to learn more about how hail forms , says dave hintz , a meteorologist at the weather service in aberdeen .	also planned : two castings will be made - one for a museum in lyman county , s.d. and another for scott to keep in his home , hintz says .

arkansas gov. mike beebe said wednesday he expects to propose an increase in public school funding but most state agencies wo n't see a major change in next year 's budget as his administration prepares to release its revenue forecast .	beebe wo n't release his balanced budget proposal until jan. 17 , but the revenue forecast that will be detailed to lawmakers on thursday will offer a glimpse at what to expect when the legislature convenes next year .	beebe said the state 's general revenue has remained stable but that next year 's budget will have to take into account tax cuts and potential reductions in federal money for some agencies . "	it 's going to be a relatively flat budget , " beebe told reporters after speaking at the arkansas farm bureau 's convention .	beebe said he expects to recommend an increase in the per-student funding the state 's schools receive from the state , but he did not say how much of an increase .	arkansas public schools received a $ 55 million increase in the current year 's budget .	beebe also said he did n't expect to propose another cut in the state 's sales tax on groceries .	proposing a tax cut during the fiscal session , which is intended to focus on budget matters , would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers to be considered .	since taking office , beebe has successfully pushed for cutting the grocery tax to 1.5 percent from 6 percent .	the most recent half-cent cut took effect in july and was part of a $ 35 million package that included a sales tax holiday and a reduction in the used car tax .	arkansas ' $ 4.6 billion budget for the current year increased funding for schools and prisons .	it kept state workers ' salaries flat after beebe agreed to drop a cost-of-living raise in order to pay for additional tax cuts .	beebe and legislative leaders said wednesday the biggest concern heading into next year 's fiscal session is how potential budget cuts at the federal level could affect state agencies .	when a deficit-reduction " supercommittee " was unable to find agreement by its deadline last week , it triggered spending cuts of $ 1.2 trillion starting in january 2013 and extending over 10 years . "	agencies that rely more heavily on ongoing federal money will be more affected than those that do n't , obviously , " beebe said .	rep. kathy webb , co-chairwoman of the joint budget committee , said much of the legislature 's work next year will depend on where the cuts come from .	arkansas relies on roughly $ 7.9 billion a year in federal funds . "	if we 're going to start seeing some serious cuts at the federal level , then we 're going to have some cuts at the state level , " said webb , d-little rock . "	there are still a lot of things up in the air . "	arkansas revenues for the year to date are $ 9.9 million above forecast , according to figures released last month .	the state ended its previous fiscal year in july with a $ 94 million surplus .
minnesota 's top revenue official says a tax deal with wisconsin is probably off for next year over minnesota 's demand to be reimbursed for lost revenue .	minnesota revenue commissioner myron frans told the associated press thursday that he does n't expect any more negotiations before monday .	that 's the deadline for an agreement to revive tax reciprocity between the neighboring states for 2013 taxes .	the impasse means that residents who live in one state and work in the other will still have to file income tax returns in both states .	about 60,000 wisconsin residents work in minnesota , and about 20,000 minnesotans work in wisconsin .	wisconsin revenue secretary richard chandler says in a column released thursday that minnesota 's demand to be paid as much as $ 15 million is " unreasonable .

"	alvarez said she and murray met jackson several other times , including after the birth of the couple 's young son .	prosecutors also asked alvarez , 29 , about shipments that murray had sent to her santa monica , calif. apartment .	she admitted receiving the items , but never opening them .	authorities contend the shipments contained the anesthetic propofol , which murray was giving to jackson as a sleep aid .	authorities accuse the houston-based cardiologist of giving jackson a lethal dose of propofol and other sedatives in the bedroom of the singer 's rented mansion .	murray 's attorneys claim jackson took the fatal dose himself .	in opening statements , a prosecutor said murray had received more than four gallons of propofol while working with jackson .	murray has pleaded not guilty .	the doctor told police after jackson 's death that he was giving the singer propofol as a sleep aid .	alvarez said after april 2009 , murray would frequently leave her apartment at night and return early the next day .	she said she knew murray was working as jackson 's personal doctor while the singer prepared for a series of comeback concerts .	phone records displayed in court monday showed murray called alvarez four times the afternoon of jacksons ' death in 2009 , including once while he was in the ambulance with jackson 's lifeless body on the way to the hospital .	for two days , prosecutors kept jurors focused on the doctor 's phone records from the day jackson died , attempting to show that murray was trying to juggle his medical practice , personal life and superstar patient all at the same time .	with alvarez and another witness , pharmacy owner tim lopez , the case shifted its focus to propofol .	lopez told jurors murray first contacted him about obtaining a skin lightening cream used to treat vitiligo , a pigment condition jackson had , but that by early 2009 he was inquiring about propofol .	earlier tuesday , a woman who was speaking on the phone with murray on the day the singer died said the call was interrupted and the physician was no longer paying attention to her .	sade anding said she heard voices , coughing and mumbling on murray 's end of the line .	she told jurors that it sounded like his cell phone was in his pocket .	anding said murray called her at 11:51 a.m. on june 25 , 2009 .	about five or six minutes into their call is when she noticed murray was no longer paying attention . "	there was a pause , " anding said . "	that 's when i realized he was no longer on the phone . " "	i heard mumbling of voices , it sounded like the phone was in his pocket , " she said . "	i heard coughing , and nobody answered . "	with the exception of alvarez , witnesses who testified about the phone calls murray made have been relatively brief , but have filled in the government 's timeline of murray 's actions in the hours leading up to jackson 's death .	the phone records have revealed the special relationship murray kept with his patients .	houston-based dr. joanne prashad told jurors she called murray the morning of jackson 's death to inquire whether it would be safe to operate on a patient whom murray had treated .	prashad said she was surprised that murray remembered the patient and the exact dosage of medicine that he was taking .	murray 's lead defense attorney ed chernoff asked prashad whether murray 's recall was unusual for a doctor .	she said yes . "	i was impressed , " prashad said .

a u.s. appeals court has overturned a disclosure requirement that public companies must post information about their use of minerals from congo , where militias linked to atrocities have profited from mining minerals used in electronics , jewelry and other goods .	the appeals court says the requirement violates the constitutional free speech rights of companies that must inform the securities and exchange commission and publicize on their websites that any of their products have not been found to be free of mineral conflicts .	while overturning the disclosure requirement , the court rejected industry arguments that the sec must conduct rigorous , quantitative economic analysis on the costs and the benefits of the conflict minerals rule .	an agency is not required to measure the immeasurable , and need not conduct a rigorous , quantitative economic analysis unless the law explicitly directs it to do so , wrote appellate judge a. raymond randolph .	the conflict minerals provision is part of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and dennis kelleher , president and chief executive of better markets , a non-profit organization , said that provision in the appeals court decision takes away one of the financial industry 's constant arguments ?	that reform costs too much money .	rejecting the industry arguments is profoundly important for financial reform , because it will enable the sec to actually pass many other financial reform rules , said kelleher .	in the portion of its ruling overturning the disclosure requirement , randolph said the label about not being free of mineral conflict requires a company to tell consumers that products are ethically tainted , even if they only indirectly finance armed groups .	compelling a company " to confess blood on its hands " interferes with the exercise of freedom of speech , said randolph .	the national association of manufacturers , the u.s. chamber of commerce and the business roundtable said they were pleased with the outcome finding a portion of the law and regulation to be unconstitutional . "	we understand the seriousness of the humanitarian situation in the democratic republic of congo and abhor the violence in that country , but this rule was not the appropriate way to address this problem , " said the business groups .	the war and humanitarian disaster in the democratic republic of congo have killed millions and armed groups fighting the war finance their operations by exploiting trade in gold , tantalum , tin and tungsten .	in 2010 , congress devised a response to the congo war , requiring firms using what are called conflict minerals to disclose the origin of those minerals .	under the law , company 's products are conflict-free if they do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups .	in dissent , appeals judge sri srinivasan said the court should wait until the same legal question is decided by the full appeals court in another case .	that case will determine whether to uphold labels on meat products that say where animals were born , raised and slaughtered .
the 160 million set-top boxes in u.s. homes cost $ 3 billion last year to operate and used the same amount of electricity as that consumed by all maryland households or produced by nine average coal-fired plants , according to the natural resources defense council , an environmental group .	two-thirds of the power , or $ 2 billion , was wasted , because the boxes were connected but were n't being used . "	this is a widely kept secret , " says report author noah horowitz , an nrdc senior scientist , adding consumers have little choice in the tv boxes provided and no idea they 're such " energy vampires . "	he says hitting the off button dims the clock or display but barely reduces power use .	he says unplugging a digital video recorder would slash energy consumption , but the box would n't record tv shows and might need to be rebooted .	the report says new dvrs use more energy than a new 42-inch flat-panel tv and half the energy of a new energy star refrigerator . "	in europe , they 're doing a better job than we are , " horowitz says , citing british sky broadcasting 's new boxes that go into " light sleep " when not in use ( halving power consumption ) and " deep sleep " at night ( slashing power use to less than 1 watt ) .	the study urges pay-tv providers to give consumers , who are footing the tab , more-energy-efficient boxes , such as the latest energy star-approved ones that use at least 30 ( percent ) less power .	providers say they 're trying to boost efficiency . "	this is an issue the cable industry is focused on " and working with manufacturers to address , says brian dietz , spokesman for the national cable & telecommunications association .	directtv deployed more than 20 million energy star boxes by the end of 2010 and expects that number to rise to 30 million by the end of this year , spokesman darris gringeri says .	at verizon , 60 ( percent ) of new boxes installed this year are energy-efficient models , and 10 ( percent ) of all the company 's boxes meet energy star criteria , says james gowen , chief sustainability officer .	he says the company does n't provide them upon request , because it does n't have enough of them yet .	gowen says set-top boxes will gradually be phased out as more people watch tv online or via video game consoles and blu-ray players .

if it had n't been for a student loan , john bobb-semple would not have gone to college .	but even with his student loans , it was n't easy .	bobb-semple , who attended tulsa community college and the university of central oklahoma , said student loans were part of the tools he needed to get his college degree . "	i was one of five children , " he said . "	if it was n't for student loans , i would n't have been able to go to college .	without them , it would not have been possible . "	but for bobb-semple the process of getting those loans , the delays and the frustrations of waiting for them to arrive and the financial problems caused by the float time were not a good part of the college experience . "	i believe student loans are 100 percent worth it , " he said . "	but there need to be changes .	students need to understand the loan and the interest , but they also need to be educated about the more consumer aspects of student loans : when they arrive , how the process works , the time frame involved on when they get their money and other issues like that . "	bobb-semple , who graduated in 2009 , said every semester there was a race to ensure that his funding had arrived , the proper amount was received and that his bills could be paid on time . "	i worked three jobs and had loans to get through school , " he said . "	and i could survive when the funds were delayed , but i know many students who really struggled .	i remember once that a friend slept on my couch for several weeks until his loans arrived .	then he could pay his rent . "	bobb-semple is n't alone .	across the nation , college students face close to $ 1 trillion in student loan debt .	according to data from the u.s. department of education , there are two main sources for student loans the soon-to-be-extinct federal family education loan , or ffel , program and the federal direct loan program .	at present , the ffel program has about $ 390 billion in outstanding loans .	that figure includes $ 77 billion in stafford loans , $ 81 billion in unsubsidized stafford loans , $ 21 billion in plus loans and $ 211 billion in consolidation loans .	the federal direct loan program has about $ 220 billion in loans , including $ 58 billion in subsidized stafford loans , $ 59 billion in unsubsidized stafford loans , $ 20 billion in plus loans and $ 83 billion in consolidation loans .	with a subsidized stafford loan , the government pays the loan 's interest while the student is in college ; with unsubsidized loans , the interest accumulates .	plus loans are those made to parents on behalf of students .	those numbers have federal and state officials scratching their heads about default rates and the amount of debt , but little has been said about the difficulty in getting loan funds dispersed .	and though federal law allows for the early dispersing of funds , not every school provides the money upfront .	in many cases , students are well into their semester before they receive their funds .	at some schools , such as the university of oklahoma , student financial aid is distributed about a week before classes start and students have the choice of receiving a check or having the funds electronically deposited in their bank accounts .	other schools , such as oklahoma city community college , put the funds on a debit card . "	we can disperse pell grants , other grants and student loans up to 10 days early , " said linette mcmurtrey , assistant director of financial aid at occc . "	we try to get it to the students as soon as possible . "	but even then , she said , some students have to wait . "	for first-time borrowers in their first academic year , there 's a 30-day wait , " she said .	mcmurtrey said her school is very conscious of the mechanics involved in distributing the funds and the amount of debt students are accumulating . "	we 're responsible for our default rate , " she said . "	and we 've worked hard to provide students with financial information about their loans .	we push financial literacy . "	mcmurtrey said some funds , such as pell grants , are slower because they are not paid until after the window for dropping classes has passed . "	pell grants are paid based on the number of hours enrolled , " she said . "	so they are n't distributed until about two weeks into the semester . "	still , for students such as bobb-semple , those two weeks can be long . "	delays can make things very difficult , " said bobb-semple , who now works as operations manager at the oklahoma dental association . "	the process needs to be streamlined .	there needs to be a type of clearinghouse and the inaccuracies eliminated .	student loans are needed , but the whole process could stand to be improved . "
south carolina lawmakers say they want to make sure illegal immigrants do n't collect jobless checks , but they delayed voting tuesday on a bill requiring the state 's unemployment agency to run applicants ' names through e-verify after an agency official said the federal government does n't want it using that online program .	a house labor subcommittee adjourned debate and directed the department of employment and workforce official to come back next week with written proof of the federal government 's response to the proposal , and data on how many fraudulent claims from illegal workers are caught now .	after the meeting , a spokesman for the u.s. department of homeland security explained the state agency should use a different federal system to check immigration status .	the bill would require the agency to screen laid-off workers ' applications through the federal online e-verify system .	but the state agency contends its current system effectively catches fraud .	for at least seven years , the agency has run applicants ' information through the social security administration to verify their numbers and dates of birth .	agency benefits director leland teal said the state has saved millions that way , but he could n't specify how much . "	we feel that 's a thorough and effective way of doing what you 're asking us to do , " teal said .	panel members asked whether e-verify could catch even more .	he acknowledged not knowing much about e-verify , or the federal government 's reasoning .	the correspondence likely referred to the agency 's need to use save ?	the systematic alien verification for entitlements ?	instead .	e-verify is for private and public employers to verify a new employee 's eligibility to work in the united states , while save program is designed for benefit-granting government agencies , said homeland security spokesman bill wright .	state law already bars illegal workers from drawing unemployment checks , and the state 's mandates on businesses to check workers ' legal status already are among the nation 's toughest .	freshmen gop rep. tom corbin said he wants to close a potential loophole in the 2008 law ?	though he has no indication violations are happening ?	especially as the state seeks to repair its unemployment insurance fund .	south carolina has borrowed nearly $ 900 million from the federal government to keep paying jobless benefits as the state 's unemployment rate soared during the past two years .	in january 2010 , it hit a record high of 12.5 percent , and was 10.7 percent last month .	changes to the taxes employers pay , which took effect jan. 1 , should make the jobless benefits trust fund solvent again by 2015 , said agency spokeswoman adrienne fairwell . "	we 're very much in debt .	it 's an inexpensive , back-end way to stave off future increases , " said corbin , r-travelers rest .	under the phased-in 2008 law , as of last july , businesses of all sizes had to check their workers ' status either with e-verify or by hiring only workers with a valid driver 's license from south carolina or 26 other approved states .	businesses face the threat of a forced shutdown if government inspectors find they employ illegal workers .	but workers could be giving a phony license , corbin said . "	there are so many loopholes , even if you do get audited , " he said .	over the past six months , the state 's labor agency randomly audited about 2,300 businesses , and audited about 50 in response to complaints .	of those , 95 employers were cited for not correctly verifying more than 1,000 employees .	the penalties tallied $ 900,000 , but the law waives fines on most first offenses , so the state collected just $ 3,200 , said jim knight , who oversees immigration compliance for the department of labor , licensing and regulation .	earlier this month , after a follow-up inspection at a mexican restaurant in columbia turned up continued problems , and a landscaper in murrells inlet admitted he knew a worker was not legal , the two businesses agreed to probation in lieu of a 10-day shutdown , knight said .	the e-verify proposal comes as state senators consider another expansion to the state 's anti-illegal immigration law .	like arizona 's law last year that inspired a flurry of lawsuits , it would allow police to check immigration status if an officer thinks a person is in the country illegally .	the query could come after a suspect is stopped for something else .	that proposal , which republicans in both chambers call a priority , is before a senate committee .	south carolina is among 11 states considering a law similar to arizona 's , according to the national conference of state legislatures .
on a call with analysts thursday , colgate execs said that customers are spending on pets again after cutting back in the depths of the recession .	bina thompson , senior vice president of investor relations , noted that colgate is tapping into the " pet humanization " trend with new products , including a " natural pet food " with no artificial flavors and a new type of pet food for older cats , called hill 's science diet age defying 11 + .	what he said : senior cats are the largest and fastest growing cat population segment .	this translates to a population segment of nearly 36 million cats experiencing 5.3 percent growth versus total cat population rates of about a 10th of 1 percent .	launch of the senior age defying 11 + formula is supported by a very powerful reason to believe as the formula fights the signs of aging in just 30 days .	consumers will see visible results as cats become more interactive and playful , more alert and agile and experience fewer litter box accidents .

faced with a republican majority in both houses of the legislature , new hampshire public employee unions are seeing an unprecedented number of anti-union bills .	the onslaught began last session with the contentious so-called right-to-work bill , which died when the house sustained gov. john lynch 's veto .	the bill has returned this session , along with other bills designed to reduce the bargaining power of public unions .	a series of bills in front of a house labor committee last week drew the ire of union members who filled representatives hall in opposition .	the proposals included prohibiting mandatory negotiating fees for employees who are n't in unions , prohibiting the taking of dues from public employees ' paychecks and banning former public employees or union members from the state 's negotiating team .	and finally , a bill written by rep. george lambert , r-litchfield , would repeal public unions ' collective bargaining powers .	similar bills have appeared in statehouses across the country as republican state legislators came into power on a wave of dissatisfaction in 2010 .	in new hampshire , unions for public employees negotiate their contracts .	both union and non-union members receive the same contract at the end of the negotiations .	proponents of collective bargaining say this ensures fair wages and a stable workforce in the absence of competition .	lambert said his collective bargaining bill was born from a desire to see public employees fairly compensated based on their skill set .	the current system , he said , rewards seniority more than skill . "	i 'm not trying to chip away ; i 'm trying to give employees a choice , " lambert said .	opponents see it as an attempt to diminish the power of workers . "	if this legislation is successful in rolling back the process to 1975 , then workers have two choices : quit their job if they 're unhappy , or to strike , " said david lang , president of the professional firefighters of new hampshire , an association of unions .	more legislation is ahead with a return of the so-called right-to-work bill , which gives employees the option to not join a union and eliminates a union 's duty to negotiate for these employees .	this time , it contains additional repeals of unions ' collective bargaining rights .	the bill is scheduled to go before a house committee feb. 9 .	the session 's volume of bills aimed at unions was unprecedented , said both house and labor leaders .	but that was n't part of house leadership 's agenda for the session , said republican house speaker william o'brien of mont vernon . "	certainly , reforming the labor marketplace is something we want to see done , but we do n't have a huge amount of staff up here so most of these appear organically , " he said .	just 9 percent of new hampshire workers belong to a union , many in the public sector , but public support for unions is strong .	sixty-two percent of respondents in a wmur granite state poll conducted in april 2011 said public employees should have the right to form unions and collectively bargain .	the right-to-work bill was being passed in the state senate about the same time .	the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points .	the bills make new hampshire yet another battleground in the national fight over workers ' rights .	wisconsin gov. scott walker successfully repealed public unions ' collective bargaining rights with the help of new republican legislative majority .	even after a recall election born from opposition to the law , republicans have retained control .	in ohio , voters rejected in november a repeal of collective bargaining .	gov. john kaisch had supported the repeal .	most recently , the indiana house passed a right-to-work bill that is expected to easily clear the republican senate and gov. mitch daniels , who called it a " bold stroke .

the family of an omaha woman killed last august says in a lawsuit that the state should n't have released from prison the man who killed her and three other people shortly after he got out .	andrea kruger 's family filed the lawsuit tuesday after officials refused to pay a $ 7.5 million claim filed last fall .	under state law , a lawsuit can be filed if the state does not approve a claim for six months .	a state prison spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit .	the 33-year-old kruger was pulled from her car on aug. 21 in northwest omaha and shot four times by nikko jenkins .	on april 16 , the 27-year-old jenkins was found guilty of killing kruger and three other people after pleading no contest .	authorities are seeking the death penalty in the criminal case .	prosecutors say jenkins fatally shot kruger , juan uribe-pena , jorge cajiga-ruiz and curtis bradford in three separate ambushes within 10 days of his july 30 release from prison .	police say jenkins used a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs aug. 11 to kill cajiga-ruiz and uribe-pena , whose bodies were found inside a pickup truck in southeast omaha .	eight days later , he used a small-caliber gun to kill bradford , a one-time prison acquaintance .	then , on aug. 21 , police say , jenkins pulled kruger from her suv as she drove home from work and shot her four times before speeding off in her vehicle . "	we 're going to show that there was a shocking breakdown in a system that is designed to protect us from bad , violent people , " lincoln attorney vince powers told the omaha world-herald .	the lawsuit said state prison officials " showed no common sense " in releasing jenkins and thus placed kruger at " great risk of harm " because the state knew jenkins intended to kill people at random after his release .	a state ombudsman 's report released in january faulted the department for its handling of jenkins ' case .	the ombudsman said prison officials failed to get jenkins mental health treatment he needed and kept him in an isolation cell for most of the last two years of his sentence because of behavior problems .	jenkins had begged corrections officials to commit him to a mental health institution before his release from prison .
ryder mcbride sat anxiously squeezing an empty 2-liter pop bottle as family and a few strangers filled his family 's living room wednesday morning .	he did not speak .	pocatello 's 8-year-old ryder has a severe form of autism which makes verbal communication difficult , if not impossible .	help may be on the way .	gary james , originally from london , has a son he classifies as " nonverbal . "	he turned to the use of an apple ipad to interact and help his 2-year-old son learn and communicate .	james presented the mc-bride family with a free ipad and a host of educational applications to better work with ryder . "	he 'll have a voice , " james said .	james , the founder of apps for children with special needs , has been traveling the united states giving an ipad and 50 apps to children with special needs in each of the 50 states .	james has about 20 more states to visit in his four-to-five week tour . "	the ipad is a device that lets us as parents and professionals teach children in a way that they need to be able to be taught , " james said . "	it 's hard for children like this to get a pen or pencil and write their name on a piece of paper , but if they have something like an ipad , and a stylus pen , not only is it a little easier for them , it 's more fun .	... it 's really about letting these kids who might be behind developmentally catch up by using this technology . "	james emphasized that the ipad is not a toy but a tool that works best when there is a " team effort " between parents and therapists encouraging its use as well as using the device .	ryder 's parents , bill and stephanie mcbride , were surprised and grateful to be the idaho recipients of the loaded ipad . "	we set it up and he was playing a game , " stephanie said . "	i was surprised he caught on so quickly .	it really had his attention .	he was mesmerized and laughing . "	stephanie had looked at purchasing an ipad after reading parents praise it online .	the only drawback is the cost of some speech and development apps , which can range in the hundreds of dollars . "	this is incredible , " bill said . "	it 's an answer to a prayer .	for a long time she 's been wanting some apps to work with this guy . "	james suggested loading only similarly-purposed apps onto the ipad for ryder to focus on , such as color , shapes or alphabet , to avoid becoming distracted with the neat looking icons that do various things .	ryder 's grandparents , marvin and roma mcbride , were at the home for the presentation and expressed their frustration for lack of support systems for parents of children with special needs .	james said his organization has built a community for parents with children of about 90 disorders .	he said the company 's aim is to directly help people and eventually have a representative in each state .	ryan wolfley , ryder 's developmental therapist , said he believes the technology will be very helpful in working with ryder .	he said he would buy an ipad , but the costly apps would be difficult to obtain . "	i think the ipad will at least give him the tools necessary to establish associations between a word and an object or interaction , " wolfley said .	apps for children with special needs plans to host future giveaways .	for more information about the nonprofit organization , persons may visit www.a4cwsn.com . "	it 's about building a community , sharing with technology and seeing what it can do for the children who have special needs , " james said .	gary james , originally from london , england , hands ryder mcbride , 8 , a new ipad .	james is part of a group that is helping developmentally disabled children through the use of applications on the ipad .	ryan 's mom , stephanie , and father , bill , along with ryan wolfley , a developmental therapist , were there also .
a senate legal committee on tuesday approved a bill that would allow victims of domestic abuse to prematurely break a rental lease to escape an abuser , among other steps that would give victims more leeway with landlords .	the measure , sponsored by state sen. sharon weston broome , d-baton rouge , also would bar landlords from evicting abuse victims for calling police to their homes .	and it would allow victims to break a lease as long as they show their landlord a police report , court papers or a letter from a care provider backing up their claim .	advocates said the measure is needed because abused women have been evicted after drawing landlord scrutiny for having the police visit .	they also said women fleeing domestic violence often find themselves impoverished and homeless . "	i know what it ' is like to be evicted because you have some nutcase in your life , " debra marie of baton rouge told the senate judiciary committee . "	to be punched , to be bruised and blackened and broken , and then have someone put you and your family out on the street ?	that 's ' unconscionable . "	over 50 percent of abuse victims that seek emergency shelter through the family justice center in new orleans are evicted because of domestic violence , said mary claire landry , executive director of the organization .	but business and property rental groups said the bill unfairly punishes them .	one reason given was that the bill would allow renters to seek punitive damages if a property dispute winds up in court .	another critic suggested victims could give false accounts of abuse in order to get out of a lease .	the bill " would treat lessors more harshly than the abusers themselves , " said stacey shane-schott , who is on the board of directors for the apartment association of greater new orleans , according to the organization 's website . "	you 're going to come after me for punitive damages , plus actual damages , if i 've done wrong when you are not even going after the abuser for that .	it makes it look like you 're coming after us . "	committee chairman j.p. morrell , d-new orleans , criticized shane-schott for her remarks , suggesting her comments were insensitive . "	we put the abusers in jail .	that 's what we do .	if you beat someone in this state , we put you in jail , " said morrell . "	you made a comment that the penalties ( to landlords ) are more onerous than to the abusers ... that is absolutely false and not true , and there are probably a lot of survivors in the room that were very offended by that .

a commission that sets salaries of elected officials in state government said thursday it ca n't order a pay cut , as requested by washington gov. chris gregoire .	the governor and other statewide elected officials have asked that their paychecks be reduced by the same level expected to be cut from the pay of state workers .	however , the washington citizens ' commission on salaries for elected officials said the state constitution forbids it from reducing pay and only allows it to freeze or raise salaries . "	it would take a constitutional amendment to do that , " said teri wright , executive assistant for the commission .	elected officials can either write a check back to the state or donate to charity , wright said .	gregoire is grappling with a projected two-year state budget deficit of $ 4.6 billion .	she unveiled a spending plan this week that proposes cuts across government , including to the pay of state workers .	gregoire announced a two-year agreement tuesday with state workers that calls for a 3 percent salary decrease in the form of unpaid leave , as well as a 25 percent increase in health insurance costs .	that same day , gregoire sent a letter to the chairman of the commission , saying her 2011-2013 budget " must include some financial sacrifice for all state employees . "	gregoire wrote that she and other statewide officials believe " we should be subject to the same salary and benefit reductions as all other state employees . "	lt. gov. brad owen , secretary of state sam reed , attorney general rob mckenna , auditor brian sonntag , superintendent of public instruction randy dorn and commissioner of public lands peter goldmark all signed the letter .	insurance commissioner mike kreidler sent his own letter to the commission asking for a pay cut .	treasurer jim mcintire also sent a separate letter , asking the commission to freeze his pay .	gregoire currently makes $ 166,891 a year .	mckenna is paid $ 151,718 ; dorn and goldmark each earn $ 121,618 ; reed , mcintire , sonntag and kreidler each get $ 116,950 , while owen is paid $ 93,948 .	in light of the commission decision , the offices of reed , dorn and kreidler said they would donate an equitable amount to charity , once the legislature finalizes the reduction to state workers .	sonntag will increase his donation to the tacoma rescue mission this month , but would not disclose the amount , his spokeswoman mindy chambers said .	mckenna was considering giving money to a nonprofit working to help overcome potential cuts to state services , perhaps one supporting foster care , mckenna spokeswoman janelle guthrie said .	gregoire 's office did not immediately respond to questions on what action she would take .	the commission was created by voters by constitutional amendment in 1986 .	the 16-member panel includes nine voters chosen at random by the secretary of state .	the other seven members come from academia , business , law , organized labor and other sectors .	the commission meets once every two years to set salaries , using consultants ' studies and discussing the changing duties and responsibilities of each office and other factors .	two years ago , after state officials including gregoire requested it , the commission froze their pay .	wright said the next commission meeting to discuss salaries is scheduled for early february , and a final decision would n't be made until may .
many of these devices now make it easy for people with home broadband networks to feed content from the internet , including hollywood movies and tv shows , onto their tvs .	what media moguls fear : 2011 could become the year in which increasing numbers of people watch web tv content from sources including netflix , itunes , youtube , amazon , vudu , hulu plus and crackle - and trim or even cancel their monthly subscriptions for cable , satellite or phone company tv service . "	you ca n't have a discussion in the media business today without this becoming the sole topic of conversation , " says craig moffett , a media analyst at financial services firm bernstein research . "	this is the whole shooting match . "	it 's sure to be a big topic this week at the international consumer electronics show convention in las vegas , where companies will unveil the new web-enabled tv devices they 'll sell this year .	there 's still wide disagreement over how many people will take to web tv and how quickly they 'll do so .	research firm snl kagan estimates that 16.5 million homes have a web tv device and 2 percent use it to watch hollywood tv shows and movies .	but most everyone agrees that the proliferation of broadband-enabled devices could lead to the biggest revolution in viewing habits since the advent of cable tv in the 1970s . "	the pace of change here has been mind-blowing , " says shawn strickland , verizon 's vice president for consumer strategy and planning . "	we 've been looking at this issue for the better part of a year , and our perspective has pretty much done a 180 " to a belief now that pay-tv " cord cutting " - industry jargon for consumers who drop their cable or satellite tv service - " will happen . "	if he 's right , web tv could upend the pay tv industry that generates about $ 140 billion a year from ad sales and consumer subscription fees , says analyst laura martin of financial services firm needham and co. .	the pieces are falling into place .	snl kagan forecasts that by 2014 , about 46.3 million homes will have at least one tv with a broadband connection to the internet and 7 percent of all households will depend on the web instead of pay tv to watch professionally produced content .	that could lead to a world in which " low-cost streaming services like netflix will increasingly become a ' good enough ' substitute for traditional pay tv , " says analyst spencer wang of financial services firm credit suisse .	increasing content online any forecast has to be taken with a grain of salt , however , because we do n't know yet the extent of programs people will be able to see online .	most of the content legally available on the web now is old , requires a subscription or rental fee or comes from broadcasters who already also offer their shows for free .	it 's great for fans of , say , the classic sitcom the jeffersons or last year 's episodes of showtime 's dexter .	but there 's no free lunch for people who want to watch the new season of hbo 's big love , the super bowl or american idol .	it 's unclear whether that will change soon .	seven companies - cbs , disney , discovery , fox , nbc universal , time warner and viacom - account for about 90 percent of all the professionally produced video that people watch . "	it 's hard to imagine that they will shoot themselves in the head " by offering more of their hottest shows online in a way that undermines their lucrative relationships with pay tv providers , moffett says .	but some of the internet 's biggest powers are working to change that : - apple last fall relaunched its apple tv box , which feeds internet video to the electronic hearth .	the company 's now cutting deals with studios including disney and fox for apple 's itunes to rent episodes of some recent tv shows for 99 cents apiece .	- google has introduced google tv , a service that helps people find tv programming on the web , including videos on google 's youtube .	the major networks are blocking their shows from google tv , at least for now .	- netflix and hulu are signing agreements with studios and program producers as the two vie to become the web 's leading subscription service for streamed movies and tv shows . "	i 'm really shocked at how much content is available online , " verizon 's strickland says . "	every day , you 're seeing a new announcement that 's breaking down the wall . "	studios may be forced to accommodate web tv if they see increasing numbers of people using the internet in their living rooms to play online games , shop or keep up with their facebook friends on their tv , says jeremy allaire , ceo of brightcove , a broadband video service company . "	that 's going to create the basis for enough adoption " of web tv to make pay tv cord-cutting a reality , he says .	those who expect a web tv surge also observe that many consumers are fed up with pay tv 's annual rate increases .	the average cost for basic service - the programming tier that includes popular ad-supported channels such as tnt , usa and discovery - will hit $ 49.72 a month this year , up 63.7 percent from 2000 , snl kagan projects .	pay tv providers say that 's still a bargain : a typical subscriber receives about 130 channels now , compared with 63 in 2000 .	but no one regularly watches all 130 channels .	and the average monthly cost for each channel that people in a household actually watch at least once a month - including the most popular programming from local tv stations that transmit abc , cbs , fox and nbc - has increased to $ 1.84 from $ 1.36 in 2000 , credit suisse analyst wang calculates .	royce brown , 53 , an electrical engineer who lives near oklahoma city , decided he 'd had enough early last year when his monthly payment for tv , broadband and phone services hit $ 185 . "	i just said , ' i can not handle any more of this . ' "	he canceled his subscription to at&t 's u-verse television service .	he replaced it with an apple tv box for web video and a rabbit-ear antenna to get local over-the-air channels free .	brown also decided to spend $ 8.99 a month to subscribe to netflix , which largely streams movies and tv shows to devices including his apple tv . "	i now have more shows that i want to watch , available to me at any time , " brown says .	with netflix , a $ 42-a-month broadband subscription from cox and a magicjack , a device that enables users to make cheap phone calls via the internet , " i 'm saving a lot of money . "	web tv is n't for everyone : for example , brown ca n't watch cnn 's live newscasts or live sports events on espn .	even so , stories like his led to speculation that a groundswell of web tv switching already has begun .	lending credibility to the idea : total pay tv subscribers declined in the second quarter - for the first time ever - to 100.1 million , down 216,000 from the previous quarter .	the industry lost an additional 119,000 customers in the third quarter .	pay tv companies say the web had little or nothing to do with the declines .	many young adults in this slow economy continue to live with their parents instead of moving to their own places and becoming new pay tv subscribers , they say .	and companies also lost customers who bought subscriptions in 2009 because they mistakenly thought that would be the only way to watch tv after broadcast stations made the federally mandated switch from analog to digital transmission .	that argument will become unpersuasive , however , if pay tv providers continue to lose customers in early 2011 , strickland says .	do n't expect much change ?	skeptics say that forecasters who expect a dramatic change to web tv do n't appreciate how important television is to most people - and how comfortable they are with their current viewing habits .	the pay tv business " is n't going to change much " in the next three years , says leichtman research group president bruce leichtman .	cord-cutting " is happening on the fringes .	i 'm not seeing anything substantial . "	indeed , ordinary viewers who watch tv every day and enjoy talking with friends about the latest shows may find web tv more expensive and less satisfying than pay tv . "	somebody who uses apple tv only could be spending easily $ 100 to $ 120 a month just ( renting shows ) for a few hours a day , " says tivo ceo tom rogers .	that 's why most people who are attracted to web tv think of it " not as a substitute , but as a supplement " to pay tv .	even people who are comfortable with the programs and prices on the web , and want to use it to cut their monthly subscription bills , may find their bargains short-lived .	that 's because cable operators also account for about 54 percent of all residential broadband subscriptions , and their market share is growing .	cable lines typically offer faster speeds than phone company dsl services , which account for 30 percent of the market .	cable companies say that if they begin to lose pay tv subscriptions , they 'd probably have to charge more for broadband . "	we are earning a reasonable return on capital , but not an excessive one , " says time warner cable ceo glenn britt . "	there 's perhaps an illusion here that ( web tv offers ) something that 's free .	it 's not . "	cable companies could raise prices across the board .	or they could begin to charge customers for the amount of broadband service they use , much as electricity , water and gas utilities do .	because video uses a lot of internet resources , people who cut their pay tv service in favor of web tv could end up paying much higher broadband fees .	but cable companies also would enter a minefield if they fiddle with broadband pricing .	competitors , including new and growing wireless internet services , could step in and use a cable price increase " as a way to gain market share , " allaire says .	if that did n't keep cable broadband prices in check , he believes the federal communications commission , which wants to promote widespread broadband usage , " would step in and take action . "	but most major cable , satellite and phone company tv services are trying to have their own angle on web tv .	they are beginning to make it possible for their subscribers to watch their pay tv programming via broadband , particularly on portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers . "	we intend to be in all those devices , " britt says .	he sees web tv " as an opportunity , not a threat . "	one way or another , then , the internet is about to reshape the usa 's favorite pastime . "	an awful lot of mainstream households for the first time are recognizing what 's out there in broadband , " rogers says . "	and their mind-set for the time being is , this is more choice - and this is really good . "

an annual report from the fbi says crime in albuquerque increased in 2011 even after the city had seen declining crime rates in previous years .	the albuquerque journal ( http://bit.ly/tlfkad ) cites figures that the albuquerque police department provided to the fbi for the report , which said property crimes such as burglary , larcenies and auto thefts increased by about 6 percent from 2010 to 2011 .	it also said violent crimes rose half a percent and major crimes increased 5 percent during that period .	reported rapes were up nearly 16 percent , while murders decreased 29 percent and aggravated assaults fell 2 percent .	for the most part , albuquerque has kept pace with the national trends of lower crime rates during the past several years , most recently from 2009 to 2010 .	albuquerque reported reductions in property and violent crimes for the fbi 's report that year .	nationally , major crimes overall were down a little more than 4 percent from 2010 to 2011 .	violent crimes were down across the nation for the fifth straight year , with a dip of 3.8 percent .	property crimes decreased nationally for the ninth straight year , with a 0.5 percent reduction .	reducing property crimes has been a cornerstone of mayor richard berry 's administration .	as recently as mid-august , the mayor touted 20-year lows in crime rates in albuquerque .	berry , who was travelling in mexico on monday , issued a statement on the crime increase through a spokeswoman . "	the crime statistics just released by the fbi show the second lowest crimes rates for albuquerque in 20 years , with 2010 being the lowest in 20 years , " according to the statement . "	although fluctuation in crime rates will occur , public safety will continue to be a priority of this administration and the police department .	our commitment to reducing crime will not waver . "	berry did n't offer an explanation for the increase in 2011 .	police chief ray schultz declined to comment .	in an interview last year , schultz pointed to the decrease in crime from 2009 to 2010 as evidence that many of his and berry 's strategies were working , such as staffing the department at its highest levels in history , with about 1,100 officers .	but by the middle of last year , manpower at the albuquerque police department was starting to decrease .	there are now fewer than 1,000 officers , and fewer than half of those work traditional patrol shifts .	that 's a trend the albuquerque police officers ' association has held up as a cause for the crime increase from 2010 to 2011 and for a one-minute increase in the amount of time it takes officers to respond to high-priority calls from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal 2012 .	schultz and berry have announced several policy changes aimed at reducing police shootings .	there have been 25 albuquerque officer-involved shootings , 17 fatal , since 2010 .	the department launched a database-driven system that will alert officers who are serving warrants or responding to other types of calls that the officer is about to encounter someone with a mental illness .	officers also are now required to record all citizen encounters with lapel-mounted cameras .
a mixed slate of reports thursday showed the u.s. economy is being held back by high gas prices and sluggish hiring .	economists are forecasting a pick-up in growth in the second half of the year .	but the latest data revealed only faint signs of a turnaround .	the commerce department said retail sales ticked up only 0.1 percent last month , after declining the previous month .	consumers spent more on cars and in big chain stores in june , but less on furniture and appliances .	the number of americans who applied for unemployment benefits dropped last week by 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 405,000 , the lowest level in three months .	still , applications have been above 400,000 for 14 straight weeks , reflecting the weak job market .	u.s. companies paid less for raw materials and factory goods in june , a separate report showed .	the decline in wholesale prices was driven by the steepest fall in energy prices in nearly two years .	gas prices dropped by the most since last may , the labor department said .	still , businesses and motorists are paying nearly a dollar more per gallon than they were a year ago .	that has forced many consumers to forgo discretionary purchases .	growth in retail sales has slowed since february ?	around the same time that gas prices began to surge . "	consumers are fatigued , " said chris christopher , an economist at ihs global insight . "	the only real good news on the consumer side of the economy is that gasoline prices started to fall , but are still relatively high . "	stock markets rose in early trading but then gave up their gains .	the dow jones industrial average fell 8 points in afternoon trading .	broader indexes also declined .	another potential problem : businesses may be forced to cut orders in the coming months after adding to their stockpiles for 17 straight months .	sales across all levels of businesses fell in may for the first time in nearly a year , the commerce department said in a fourth report .	fewer sales are a sign that companies may have overestimated consumer demand .	jpmorgan economist michael feroli said the bank lowered its growth forecast for the july-september period based on the latest data on stockpiles .	he said it expects only 2.5 percent growth , down from its initial estimate of 3 percent .	that 's not much higher than the 2 percent growth most analysts expect for the first half of the year .	the economy would need to grow 5 percent for a whole year to bring down the unemployment rate by one percentage point .	economic growth of just 3 percent a year would hold the unemployment steady and keep up with population growth . "	clearly the recent stalling in employment growth has forced households to be a bit more careful with their cash , " said paul dales , senior u.s. economist with capital economics . "	for the moment , these data will do little to dispel fears that the economic recovery is going nowhere . "	companies pulled back on hiring sharply this spring .	the economy added only 18,000 net jobs in june , the second straight month of dismal hiring .	the unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent , the highest this year .	that 's far below the average job gains of 215,000 per month in the february-april period .	the decline in unemployment benefit applications is an encouraging sign that layoffs are dropping and the job market may be slowly improving .	the total would have been even lower if minnesota 's government was n't shutdown .	that caused 11,500 state workers to file applications last week , the department said .	the four-week average , a less volatile measure , dropped to 423,250 last week .	that 's the lowest since late april .	applications had fallen in february to 375,000 , a level that signals healthy job growth .	but they rose above 400,000 in early april and have yet to fall below that level since .	federal reserve chairman ben bernanke told congress on wednesday that temporary factors , such as high gas prices and supply chain disruptions caused by the japan crises , have slowed the economy .	they should begin to fade and the economy should grow at a faster pace in the second half of this year , he said .	but if not , he said the central bank is prepared to do more to stimulate growth .	gas prices peaked in early may near $ 4 a gallon ( $ 1.05 a liter ) but have fallen steadily since .	prices at the pump averaged $ 3.66 on thursday , according to aaa .	cheaper gas dragged down overall retail sales in june .	sales at gas station tumbled 1.3 percent in june .	consumers also spent less on furniture , electronics , appliances and sporting goods for a third straight month .	shoppers did boost purchases at general merchandise stores , which include stores such as wal-mart and target .	sales at those stores rose 0.4 percent .	the producer price index , which measures price changes before they reach the consumer , declined 0.4 percent in june .	wholesale energy prices fell 2.8 percent , the biggest decline in nearly two years .	food prices rose 0.6 percent in june , mostly because of higher fruit and melon costs .	oranges jumped 41.2 percent , and carbonated soft drinks rose 7.5 percent , the most since the government began tracking that category in 1996 .	excluding the volatile food and energy categories , the so-called core index rose 0.3 percent , driven largely by a jump in prices for pickup trucks .
boy meets girl , boy cons girl , boy steals girl 's money and honor ?	or does he ?	the nature of self-delusion is explored with disturbing results in " tryst , " a dark , disquieting edwardian psychological drama by karoline leach now performing at off-broadway 's irish repertory theatre .	leach has written a clever send-up of the standard gullible-female-meets-dastardly-villain scenario .	mark shanahan portrays con man george love with zeal , scoring laughs with his disheveled expressiveness even when the proceedings are n't so comical .	george preys on vulnerable women with any easily accessible money , but still considers himself a kind , generous man .	he marries each woman and gives her one night of lovemaking , which he considers to be the " quid pro quo " for when he disappears the morning after , leaving the women penniless and heartbroken .	things change for george when he meets a fretful , shy but talented hatmaker named adelaide , played to nervous perfection by andrea maulella .	in small , fluttering gestures , maulella delicately reveals the reasons adelaide is brimming with self-hatred .	but beneath the surface of a seemingly easy mark , adelaide is steelier than she appears , and she upends george 's modus operandi in unexpected , heartfelt ways .	the production is directed by joe brancato with a sure hand that builds the suspense in this battle-of-the-damaged-sexes thriller .	michael schweikardt 's moody set transforms from a bleak , foggy london street to a down-at-heels seaside boarding-house room , in which the plot twists and turns pile up in the second act , aided by subtle lighting and sound design and alejo vietti 's neatly detailed costumes .	maulella and shanahan subtly and expertly provide convincing hope that their characters can transcend the narrow roles proscribed by their class and unfortunate circumstances .

the state 's latest financial analysis says legalizing and taxing marijuana could bring washington as much as nearly $ 2 billion over the next five years ?	or as little as nothing .	the office of financial management released its fiscal impact statement for initiative 502 on friday , and the results track closely with its earlier analysis , released in march .	i-502 , which will be on the november ballot , would legalize pot under state law and allow its sale at state-licensed stores , with tax proceeds dedicated to education , health care and substance abuse prevention .	oregon and colorado voters will also decide on marijuana legalization measures this fall .	marijuana would remain illegal under federal law , however , and it is n't clear how the federal government would respond if any of the states voted to legalize it .	the justice department could prosecute employees of state-licensed pot shops , sue in federal court to block the laws from taking effect , or simply seize the tax revenue from the states as proceeds of transactions that are illegal under federal law .	because the federal response remains unclear , washington 's analysts said they could not determine the ultimate effect of i-502 on the state 's finances .	however , they said , assuming a fully functioning marijuana market develops ?	and that it entirely replaces the existing illicit market ?	state revenue from pot sales could be more than $ 1.9 billion over the next five years .	the state typically spends $ 30 billion per two-year budget cycle .	i-502 would create a system of state-licensed growers , processors and stores , and impose a 25 percent tax at each stage .	people 21 and older could buy up to an ounce of dried marijuana , one pound of marijuana-infused product in solid form , such as brownies , or 72 ounces of marijuana-infused liquids .	the analysis anticipates 100 state-licensed growers supplying 328 marijuana stores that would sell more than 187,000 pounds to at least 363,000 customers .	those numbers are based on federal drug-use surveys .	consumers would pay $ 12 per gram ?	the price currently charged by many medical marijuana dispensaries ?	plus the 25 percent marijuana tax , 10 percent state sales tax , and any local sales tax , the analysts assumed .	the document noted that washington would likely lose some federal money to fight drugs , such as a marijuana eradication grant from the drug enforcement administration .	however , the analysis did not take into account any possible savings from no longer arresting , prosecuting and jailing people for having small amounts of marijuana , and alison holcomb , campaign manager for i-502 , said she found that disappointing .	about 10,000 people in washington are charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession each year .

"	this defendant maliciously and dangerously drugged patients for her own personal convenience .	this is clearly outrageous conduct that justifies a state prison sentence , " harris said in a written statement .	attempts to reach hughes for comment were unsuccessful .	the doctor 's orders were later signed by the medical director , dr. hoshang pormir , who in july 2012 was sentenced to 300 hours of volunteer service , restitution pending conclusion of civil lawsuits , and a requirement to comply with all orders from the state medical board .	investigators say pormir failed to conduct examinations of patients or monitor their reactions to medications .	pamela ott , the former chief executive officer of the kern valley health district , pleaded no contest to one felony count of conspiracy to commit an act injurious to the public health , based on her failure to adequately supervise hughes .	ott was sentenced to three years of formal probation , 300 hours of volunteer service , restitution , and a requirement to comply with the medical board 's orders .	the california department of public health first began to investigate the facility in 2007 , following complaints from an ombudsman that a patient at the facility had been held down and forcibly injected with psychotropic medicine .	they found evidence of patient harm and turned the case over to the justice department .

the oldest junior college in texas is seeking permission to sell a " substantial amount " of its property after filing for bankruptcy earlier this year .	lon morris college is a 158-year-old united methodist school in east texas but has suspended its fall semester .	the tyler morning telegraph reported sunday ( bit.ly / sfvabx ) that the school submitted an application sept. 28 in federal bankruptcy court seeking permission to sell much of its property .	the application says lon morris has an estimated 112 acres of real estate with dorms , classroom buildings , a library , a chapel , and admission buildings .	sales would pay creditors and former employees .	lon morris is in jacksonville , a town of about 14,500 people about 125 miles southeast of dallas .	a judge may decide on the college 's request at a hearing scheduled for oct. 31 .	if it 's accepted , a property auction could be held nov. 15 , according to the application .	the newspaper cites the application in reporting that lon morris is trying to hire an auction company that would market and sell school and certain personal property and at least two of the major secured creditors agreed " to a cash auction of real estate by public auction free and clear of liens , claims , charges , encumbrances and interests . "	meanwhile , capstone partners , which the school previously hired to facilitate an agreement with an educational and financial partner , has suspended its efforts , partly because lon morris lost title iv eligibility .	the firm made the move even though the application indicates that there was some interest from would-be partners , according to the telegraph .	jack nelson , who has served as lon morris ' board vice president , told the newspaper the school has made a small income through selling vehicles , but that he believes those proceeds were used to keep the doors open and have people at the college respond to transcript requests and check on the facilities .	lon morris suspended classes in august after the u.s. department of education decided not to allow students to use federal aid there .	federal statutes disqualify schools that file for bankruptcy .	a few years ago , the two-year college reinstated its football team after a nearly 70-year hiatus in hopes of saving it from mounting debt by increasing enrollment .	instead , the school was burdened with waves of new students who could n't pay their bills and overwhelming football expenses .	the college 's football-based revitalization strategy involved recruiting more than 300 football players for the first season on partial scholarships of $ 7,500 each , leaving them to pay more than $ 15,000 in remaining expenses and replenish the school 's coffers .	the recruiting helped more than triple the school 's enrollment to about 1,000 students by 2010 .	the campus did n't have enough room to house the rush of new students , so administrators leased a nearby hotel .	lon morris also offered huge tuition discounts to players ?	as high as 53 percent in 2010 ?	and failed to collect payments from those who could not pay , yet continued to take classes .	other costs , including hiring security to combat reports of misbehaving players , further damaged the school 's finances .	the debt topped out at more than $ 20 million , according to court documents , forcing administrators to furlough almost the entire faculty .

republican ken cuccinelli pushed his knowledge of virginia 's government in a debate wednesday that , at times , left his democratic opponent in the governor 's race , terry mcauliffe , without answers or changing the subject .	and cuccinelli found himself furiously rejecting mcauliffe claims that his actions against gay rights as attorney general had almost driven business from virginia and that he had put wealthy benefactors and campaign contributors ahead of virginia taxpayers .	the first prime-time television debate in virginia 's 2013 governor 's race provoked overstated rhetoric that left both crying foul wednesday night .	cuccinelli scored sound points repeatedly asserting government experience he gleaned in eight years as a state senator and the last four as attorney general .	at one point he exposed that mcauliffe did n't know that state constitutional amendment ?	not a law ?	is required to reverse the state 's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage .	mcauliffe had just told nbc news political director chuck todd , the fairfax county chamber of commerce debate moderator , that he supports " marriage equality " and claimed that cuccinelli had called gays " soulless and self-destructive human beings . "	mcauliffe said it was a major difference between the two .	cuccinelli denounced the quote about gays that mcauliffe had attributed to him as " offensively false . "	but at a 2008 family foundation event , cuccinelli , then a state senator , was quoted as saying , " when you look at the homosexual agenda , i can not support something that i believe brings nothing but self-destruction , not only physically but of their soul . "	later , cuccinelli flipped the question of mcauliffe 's statements about virginia 's 2006 amendment limiting marriage in virginia to a man and a woman , lecturing mcauliffe ?	who has never held elective public office ?	on legislative process .	mcauliffe said that if he could get a marriage equality bill on his desk , he 'd sign it . "	actually , it does n't happen in the form of a bill .	it 's a constitutional amendment so it never comes to the governor , " cuccinelli said .	to amend the constitution , a resolution must be passed unchanged by virginia 's general assembly in two separate years divided by a legislative election , then put on a statewide ballot for voter approval in a general election .

in a somewhat surprising move , the national rifle association on wednesday endorsed republican dan newhouse for central washington 's u.s. house seat .	the other candidate , fellow republican clint didier , has made support for gun rights a central theme of his campaign . "	wonder who got to them ( nra ) , " didier tweeted on wednesday .	both candidates are seeking to replace u.s. rep. doc hastings , also a republican , who is retiring .	newhouse , an establishment republican , said he is pleased to receive the endorsement . "	i am a long-standing member of the national rifle association and as a state legislator , i was endorsed by the nra with its highest possible rating , " newhouse said in a press release .	chris cox , a lobbyist for the nra , pointed to newhouse 's " a '' rating in the state legislature in making the decision to back his candidacy .	didier , from the tea party branch of the gop , has attempted to attack newhouse for not making the issue of gun rights a higher priority in his campaign .	didier raffled off three firearms during the primary to promote his support of the second amendment .	didier earlier received the endorsement of the national association for gun rights . "	dan newhouse would let a single judge decide you ca n't buy a gun but nra endorses him , " didier also tweeted .
one evening this past may , casey martin sat on her couch , watching television and enjoying some cookies and milk as a late-night snack .	as she finished , she brushed crumbs off her blouse , and as she did so , she discovered a lump on her breasts .	having gone through surgery to have endometrial cancer removed last fall , she immediately became concerned and contacted her doctor .	she visited the breast center in carbondale , a branch of southern illinois healthcare and met dr. cynthia aks .	she underwent a series of tests , and they worked through the issues and determined the best course of action . "	she sat with me ?	we sat for a good hour ?	and she made sure i understood all the ways we could attack this , " martin said . "	i had no idea what kind of great team we had here .	they give you the confidence to feel you 're in the best hands and to think the best is possible . "	within six weeks of first detecting her breast cancer , martin was undergoing surgery .	she began chemotherapy in august and will complete those procedures soon .	she will then begin receiving radiation treatments for six to seven weeks .	martin said she 's reacted fairly well to the treatments , and she remains upbeat and positive .	she hopes she can be an inspiration to other women , and she wants them to know it 's okay to occasionally feel down but to remember in the end that everything will be okay . "	it does n't have to be scary .	just keep your humor and stay as upbeat as you can , " she said . "	it is n't as if i have n't had a few pity parties and all-out cries along the way , " she said . "	but then you stop and think , ' where is this getting me ?	nowhere . ' "	but martin 's journey is n't over .	through the process of testing and screening , she tested positive for carrying the brca2 gene mutation , which makes the carrier more susceptible to breast and other forms of cancer .	women who have inherited the mutation are five times more likely to contract breast cancer than those who have n't , according to the american cancer society .	when aks joined the breast center , she brought genetic testing for brca mutations to the forefront of people 's minds .	the center offers a comprehensive program to help people determine their risk level .	now , a new service even allows for genetic consultation to be done at patients ' homes , whereas they would have to travel to st. louis or further in the past . "	most of them could n't do it or just did n't want to , " aks said .	indicators of a brca gene mutation can include a family lineage with a history of breast cancer , developing multiple cancers in one individual and contracting breast cancer under the age of 50 .	since the opening of the high risk breast clinic at the breast center a few months ago , local residents have more of an outlet to learn about these factors and to have testing and consultations .	aks said she 'd like to see other similar programs launch locally focused on other specific cancers like melanoma and colon cancer . "	this is kind of like a springboard , " she said .	and for patients like martin , the resources , companionship and education offered by the breast center and aks and her staff have proven invaluable and helped to not only make the experience better but also to fill martin with optimism and positivity .	while several relatives have lost their battle with breast cancer , including her grandmother who died in her mid-70s , the 59-year-old is n't letting that affect her mindset . "	i 'm heading for 90 ; that 's where i 'm going , " she said .
new statistics from the utah bureau of criminal information show violent crimes dropped in 2009 , but thefts of goods like gasoline and food rose significantly .	the report shows that overall , violent crime was down 6 percent during 2009 .	property crimes were down 2 percent .	larcenies , however , increased .	the preliminary report includes statistics from just four cities : provo , salt lake city , west jordan and west valley city .	in some cities , thefts of consumable items increased significantly and overall the report found the dollar value of stolen consumable goods stolen in 2008 doubled in 2009 .	in west valley city , more than $ 80,000 worth of consumable goods was stolen in 2009 , compared to just over $ 47,000 in 2008 .	west jordan saw less than $ 6,500 in consumable goods stolen in 2008 , compared to over $ 21,000 in 2009 .	provo saw the most dramatic jump .	statistics showed nearly $ 458,000 in goods were stolen in 2009 .	just $ 6,700 in goods was reported stolen in 2008 .	but some say the report is misleading and that the statistics skew the picture of the problem .	provo city spokeswoman helen anderson said a single incident ?	an alleged theft of some $ 450,000 in products by employees of nuskin ?	dramatically altered the city 's statistics .	if that incident is excluded , the numbers for 2008 and 2009 were similar , she said .	in other categories , salt lake city , west jordan , west valley and provo , all reported increases in theft in the category of " jewelry and precious metals . "	west valley saw an additional $ 300,000 worth of those materials stolen in 2009 from 2008 , according to bci .	salt lake police sgt. bryan jewkes believes the increase in the theft of precious metals is related to a rise in the value of those items and what metal recycling shops will pay for them .	metal thefts shot up dramatically across the wasatch front a few years ago and cooled off in recent months because of a drop in prices .	police say the thefts are typically committed by drug addicts looking for quick money .	bci data also showed thefts of televisions , radios and stereos were up .	jewkes said the poor economy may be partially to blame , but notes that many of the incidents were also crimes of opportunity .

beyond billy-bob teeth , entrepreneur , innovator and motivator jonah white really shows his teeth when it comes to life .	unlike billy-bob teeth , life is no gag gift , but a real gift , constantly evolving , to be savored , enjoyed and shared , white , of michael , near hardin , writes in his 2009 autobiography , " the billy-bob secret ... to : life . "	white , a multimillionaire who still lives on the property where his parents , the late john and ella white , raised him on a primitive homestead with his three siblings , is the largest employer in calhoun county .	he has 20 to 25 full-time employees with full health insurance and benefits paid 100 percent by white .	in the last several weeks during the build-up to halloween , white 's company shipped out from 300,000 to 500,000 units of billy-bob teeth , vampire fangs and goofy teeth-embedded baby pacifiers that sell more outside the united states than within the united states .	but this is really the least important thing to white , he said he came to realize since 1994 , when the whole billy-bob teeth craze began unfolding . "	i 'm a simple creature , like a caveman , " white said . "	ninety percent of my book is seeing how a person wandered through life with a completely different thought process .	now , i disassociate myself with my surroundings , and ask myself , ' am i happy and content with my surroundings , and will i remember this day ? ' "	in the book , which comes with a downloadable audio version , he asks readers to do the same . "	i 'm always challenging people to think differently , about how they choose a career , take care of their body .	but people do n't do that .	they 're creatures of habit ; change is difficult for most people , " he said .	white had to change his thinking about being a professional football player , even though he broke numerous records at southwest missouri state university ( now missouri state ) in springfield , where he was the all-time leading rusher and leader in scoring when his career ended .	after his illustrious college football stint , the former running back needed to come up with something to get out of the hole in which he was living ?	literally ?	in 1994 . "	i was living in a cave in calhoun county right after the '93 flood .	the goals i set out with did n't come to fruition ; i did n't make the nfl , " white recalled .	the guy did n't even get a scholarship and had to pay back student loans . "	i decided i wanted to sell something to people all over the world that they could hold in their hand , so that i could sell from my home , or rather my parents ' home in michael , illinois , population 30 people , " he explained .	ironically , white found billy-bob teeth in a football stadium , and not because white 's actual teeth looked like the gnarly incisors after a tackle , but because his future best friend tried to endear some women with his own ugly teeth .	during white 's five years at smsu , his coach was jesse branch , who spent 35 years coaching at the collegiate level .	after white had graduated , branch called the house of his former player 's parents , because white did n't have a telephone in the cave .	branch asked white to come back to springfield and talk to his bears team , which was going through their first losing season .	white had been the first player to rush for 2,150 yards in a single season at calhoun high school in hardin , where he led the state in rushing , tackling and scoring , and was one of the leading high school rushers in the nation .	the 1987 chs graduate accepted the invitation to talk to his old college team .	he hitched a ride to the college 's forsythe athletic center in springfield , mo. , with one of his father 's edwardsville friends and talked to the team . "	when i was in the stadium , i saw this guy with terrible teeth , talking trash to some girls , and it was the ugliest thing you ever seen , " white recalled . "	going to missouri state in southwest missouri , it 's not really too far-fetched , but the guy oozed so much confidence and was like a body-builder , it was hard to believe he would take care of his body like that , but not his teeth . "	the guy , rich bailey , who happened to be a dental student at the southern illinois university school of dental medicine in upper alton , knew white 's college celebrity and went to him after the game that day .	he told white he knew who he was , shook his hand and started telling white some crazy stories that bailey knew about white 's football glory days . "	i know this was the same guy i saw in stands , and his teeth were perfect , " white said , still marveling at the transition billy-bob teeth made in bailey 's appearance . "	he says , ' you like my billy-bob teeth ? '	and pulls them out of his pocket and snaps them in . "	white asked where he got them . "	he said he made them at dental class at siu in alton ; they were invented in alton , " white declared .	with that revelation , white and bailey joined forces to pay back their student loans . "	in three weeks , i took my entire net worth , which was a springfield .45 pistol , and sold it for $ 400 , and we incorporated , " white said .	bailey , a struggling sophomore $ 250,000 in debt at a tough-curriculum , renowned dental school that had only a 50 percent pass rate , wound up being penniless , student loan-indebted white 's partner for the next four years . "	when he graduated , he just worked with me selling billy-bob teeth ; my mom , who was cfo , ran the shipping department out of my parents ' home , " white said . "	there was no fake teeth market when i graduated from college and trying to figure out how to pay my student loans back .	you have to see the world and do things differently ; i had to think outside the box , because it would n't be possible with the means i had . "	white and bailey partnered in michael until 1997 , a year before white moved the corporate office to hardin , and bailey moved to moscow , idaho , to practice dentistry with his own small practice , relinquishing his billy-bob teeth interests . "	i 've still given him lots of money when the business has done well ; i still see him a couple times a year , " white said about his best friend , who retired at age 35 . "	he bought a mountain and was the first student to settle his student loan with his school in the time frame that he did . "	with the first check they got from spencer 's gifts , bailey paid his student loan .	white elaborates in the book on bailey 's idaho move and his goal to practice dentistry in a small pacific northwest logging community .	today , white has a hong kong factory , from where he has to maintain a facility in order to sell units to u.s. k-marts , he explained ; but he 's still the no. 1 employer in calhoun county .	since the company 's inception , white has sold more than 15 million units of billy-bob teeth and other related novelty products now , including zombie feet sandals and hats with hair .	he has produced and sold 225,000 units from calhoun county .	he sells to about 30,000 u.s. locations and about 25 countries .	the last two years , white donated $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 , respectively , to spirit of children , which includes about a dozen hospitals , mostly in the st. louis metro region , for children 's issues .	in 1998 , the last year white ran the billy-bob business out of his parents ' house , billy-bob teeth grossed $ 1.8 million .	it was the same year that his mother , ella , born in 1936 of jewish descent , who white buried saturday at a family indian mound on the michael homestead , began writing white 's book . "	the book is something i always wanted to do , which my mom was a writer , " recalled white , whose father was primarily native american and lived on reservations of oklahoma . "	she made me promise , but i was just not ready to write a book ?	not enough life experience , although lots of business experience and millions of dollars .	but it 's not about trying to make money ; making money is not my life goal . "	white 's parents came to michael when his father , also known as five bears , took a job with the kampsville archeology program , an offshoot at the time of northwestern university in evanston , ill. , after being curator for the chicago 's field museum 's native american division .	he died in 2006 . "	he was in charge of all research , dioramas , went to stanford , " white said .	white met his wife , renee , in australia , which he describes in the book 's " wife shopping " chapter .	the couple has four children : daughter sydney , 13 , son scout , 11 , daughter summer , 10 , and son sage , 8 .	white has been featured on the " the today show , " '' good morning america , " joan rivers ' " how 'd you get so rich ? "	and other television specials .	reality show , " missouri truck stop , " filmed white last week .	white reveals many more details of his unconventional life and upbringing in " the billy-bob secret ... to : life , " also full of archival images , including photos and documents .
republican matt bevin , democrat jack conway and independent drew curtis have contrasted sharply in a race watched closely for its proximity to the 2016 presidential election and for its competitiveness in one of the nation 's last two-party states .	they are running to replace gov. steve beshear , who can not seek re-election because of term limits .	the two major-party candidates and their allies have spent more than $ 14 million to air more than 41,000 tv ads in kentucky , according to an analysis by the center for public integrity .	that 's not counting radio and direct mail ads or tv ads on local cable systems .	a surge in absentee ballots forced secretary of state alison lundergan grimes to revise predictions of a dismal turnout .	she now predicts it will equal or exceed that of 2011 , when 28 percent of registered voters cast ballots to re-elect beshear .	polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time .	bevin voted at the louisville presbyterian theological seminary at about 7:40 a.m. conway voted about an hour later at the knights of columbus hall in louisville .	both men claimed to have the momentum to win the election . "	( the race ) seems more visceral in some respects , and i think that 's a good thing , " bevin told reporters after casting his vote .	conway said voter turnout in jefferson county , which includes louisville and is the state 's most populous county , appeared higher than in previous governor 's races . "	my wife and i ... this morning we got up , we looked at each other and we said , ' we gave it our all . '	that 's all you can do , " he said .	bevin , a louisville businessman , mounted an unsuccessful , high-profile republican primary challenge to u.s. sen. mitch mcconnell in 2014 .	he contrasts his experience as an investment manager with conway , whom he calls a " career politician . "	bevin has recently emphasized their differences on social issues , including abortion , as he courted the state 's majority democratic voters to " vote your values , not your party . " "	we believe in a smaller government , and the private industry experience he has will bring in new jobs , new industry and cut back on taxes , " said ron stocks of lexington who said he plans to vote for bevin .	conway , kentucky 's two-term democratic attorney general , lost a high-profile u.s. senate race against rand paul in 2010 .	he claims the experience to lead state government and has promised to expand kentucky 's public preschool options . "	he 's a champion of public education and early childhood education .	and that 's just incredibly important , " said diane spurlock , 76 , of lexington , who said she plans to vote for conway .	curtis , the founder and operator of news aggregation website fark.com , casts himself as an alternative to political party ideology , but he has struggled to get his message out to voters .	with less than 10 percent of support in public polls , curtis was excluded from most of the televised debates .	much of the race has focused on beshear 's decision to expand kentucky 's medicaid program to insure an additional 400,000 people and his creation of a state-run health insurance exchange where an additional 100,000 people bought private health insurance plans with the help of federal subsidies .	bevin says taxpayers can not afford to continue to pay for the health insurance of a quarter of the state 's population .	he has promised to repeal the exchange and expansion and replace them with something else , possibly requiring recipients to pay a small premium for coverage .	conway calls bevin 's plan " callous , " saying it would remove coverage from hundreds of thousands of people who need it .	he has pledged to continue both programs , as has curtis .	rowan county clerk kim davis shook up the race during the summer when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples .	a judge later jailed her for refusing to obey his court order .	her office is now issuing the licenses , but her case is still pending .	bevin supported davis and used her plight to rally religious conservatives statewide .	conway and curtis said the judge was correct to jail davis for refusing to do her job .	but none of the candidates has focused much on davis or same-sex marriage in recent weeks as national polls suggest the majority of americans do not support her actions .

in a speech to a business conference on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit , xi said china is committed to overhauling its economy and raising the living standards of its people .	china 's growth fell to a six-year low of 6.8 percent in the latest quarter as beijing tries to shift the economy away from reliance on trade and investment .	the slowdown , which has been unfolding for several years , has rippled around the world , crimping growth in countries such as south korea and australia that were big exporters to china .	xi acknowledged that china 's vital signs are a concern and that it is facing " difficulties and challenges . "	but he also alluded to the fact china is growing much faster than western countries even as it slows . "	china 's positive economic fundamentals and long term trajectory remain unchanged , " he said . "	china 's economy has strong resilience , great potential and ample room for maneuvering . "	he also said beijing is stepping up efforts to counter climate change and clean up its environment , which has been heavily polluted by years of breakneck economic growth . "	we will make ecological progress part and parcel of the entire process of our economic and social development , " xi said .	weeks away from a deadline for an agreement to limit global warming , president barack obama sought to build momentum for the pact on wednesday , reasoning that bold climate action will be a boon for businesses in asia and around the world .	at the apec business conference , obama urged business leaders to reduce their own emissions and pressure governments to sign on to an international carbon-cutting pact to be discussed beginning nov. 30 in paris . "	your businesses can do right by your bottom lines and by our planet and future generations , " obama said . "	the old rules that said we ca n't grow our economy and protect our economy at the same time -- those are outdated . "	the 21-member apec bloc accounts for about 60 percent of the global economy .	it groups the united states and china with middle powers such as australia as well as developing nations in asia and south america .	all the events at the summit are tightly scripted and security has been extremely heavy .	thousands of police and military personnel are deployed in manila and some downtown thoroughfares are closed to all but official vehicles .	about two hundred protesters trying to march on apec venues wednesday were blocked by riot police .	the anti-globalization protesters waved " junk apec " banners , jostled with police and burnt a mock u.s. flag .	xi did not comment on territorial disputes in the south china sea , which are not part of the official apec agenda but are hanging over the summit .	on wednesday , obama called on china to halt further land reclamation and new construction in the disputed waters .	at a meeting with philippine president benigno aquino iii , obama called for " bold steps " to lower tensions over china 's territorial ambitions , which have recently centered on construction of artificial islands in seas claimed by the philippines and other southeast asian countries .	such rifts often have strained apec 's facade of handshakes and unity , overshadowing talks on trade and development .	in a high-profile show of support for american allies in asia , the u.s. has conducted military maneuvers recently near islands where china has reclaimed land and built settlements

state troopers want to drop the word ' highway ' from their agency 's name and become known as the tennessee state patrol .	the senate transportation committee on wednesday unanimously advanced a measure sponsored by republican sen. steve southerland of morristown to a full floor vote after receiving assurances that the change would not be a step toward creating a state police force .	the tennessee blue book notes that the " tennessee highway patrol 's primary responsibility is traffic enforcement , " but col. tracy trott told the panel that the name change would better reflect activities that also include riot squads , bomb detection units and swat teams . "	it 's something that i think better depicts a modern state law enforcement agency , " the thp commander said .	trott said the proposal did not originate with republican gov. bill haslam 's administration , but added that safety commissioner bill gibbons " does not object " to the proposal .	assistant safety commissioner david purkey , a former state trooper , also spoke in favor of changing the name of the agency created in1929 . "	for years i have heard troopers mention that they would like to be depicted more fairly to reflect what the department does , and what they do as state troopers , " he said .	a spokeswoman for the safety department said the agency does not maintain statistics on what portion of the thp 's activities are dedicated to areas other than traffic enforcement .	the thp 's organizational structure was overhauled during the administration of former democratic gov. phil bredesen in response to a series of scandals that included troopers with criminal records , allegations of ticket-fixing and a culture of cronyism and political arm-twisting .	one trooper was fired in 2008 for conducting unauthorized background checks on nearly 200 people , and another one resigned a year earlier after a porn actress claimed he let drug charges slide in exchange for sex acts captured on video .	trott said the name change would not cost anything because it would be phased in on new vehicles and materials such as stationery and reports .	costs and the perception of the motivation for the change were the only concerns raised by committee members . "	i think we 've always tried in tennessee , as far as i know , to make plain that we do n't have a state police force like kentucky , " said democratic sen. douglas henry of nashville .	trott said the proposal is not an attempt to change the thp 's mission . "	this is not a first step toward a state police organization , " he said . "	we are not asking for any more authority , and we would not accept any more authority . "	this is simply a cosmetic name change to better depict what we do now . "
abc 's wholesome and disney-esque once upon a time , airing sundays ( 8 et/pt ) , and nbc 's darker grimm , premiering friday ( 9 et/pt ) , both offer new spins on an ancient genre .	and chances are good these fresh twists on the ubiquitous classics can be very entertaining , says adam gidwitz , author of his own brothers grimm-inspired children 's novel , a tale dark and grimm . "	fairy tales endure because they speak to ( our ) deep needs and deep fears , " says gidwitz . "	when the world feels disenchanted , we want to go to a place of enchantment .	watching a tv show about fairy tales or reading a book about fairy tales is like that . "	in once upon a time , jennifer morrison ( house ) stars as emma swan , a bail bondswoman whose life changes when the son she gave up for adoption 10 years before shows up on her doorstep .	henry ( jared gilmore ) tells the disbelieving emma that she 's the daughter of snow white ( ginnifer goodwin ) and prince charming ( josh dallas ) .	in flashbacks , viewers learn that all our beloved fairy-tale characters are under the spell of the evil queen ( lana parrilla ) , who has catapulted them out of fairy-tale land and into modern times .	they now live in storybrooke , maine , with no memory of who they really are .	it 's up to emma , henry tells her , to break the spell .	familiar , yet different " there 's a feeling of familiarity with these characters that will hopefully be enticing and make people immediately feel comfortable in this world , " says morrison , who thinks the show could appeal to multiple generations of fantasy fans just like harry potter and the lord of the rings .	other recognizable characters in the show include rumpelstiltskin and jiminy cricket .	the characters may feel familiar , but the show 's creators/executive producers , edward kitsis and adam horowitz ( lost ) , say they 're adding a dose of realism . "	our whole approach has been to take these icons and turn them into flesh-and-blood people with real problems that are relatable to everyone , " says horowitz .	in grimm , portland homicide detective nick burkhardt ( david giuntoli ) discovers he 's a descendant of a long line of grimms -- for the show 's purposes , not story-tellers but rather criminal profilers -- whose job has always been to hunt down the fairy-tale monsters who secretly live among us . "	these fairy tales are not the disneyfied ones that have been handed down to us , " says giuntoli . "	they were laundered and sanitized for us when we were kids , but the source material is very gruesome .	anyone who likes a little scare is going to love this show . "	in the series premiere , for example , nick -- who is gifted with the ability to see monsters who live among us , disguised as humans -- hunts a wolflike creature who 's kidnapping little girls wearing , naturally , red overcoats .	grimm executive producers jim kouf and david greenwalt ( both of whom worked on angel ) apply a somewhat heavier hand to their stories , but also are counting on nostalgia to draw viewers . "	they wo n't get the sanitized versions they 're used to , " says kouf . "	we 're staying close to the original material , which was pretty dark . "	no grimmer than grimm in fact , the original grimm tales , written two centuries ago , were more horrifying than anything we 'd be likely to see on network tv . "	cinderella is one of my favorite stories of all times , " says gidwitz , " but while i love the disney movie with the singing mice , in the grimm version of cinderella the two stepsisters take a knife and cut off their toes and heels and shove them into the slippers to get them to fit . "	kouf says he and greenwalt are " fracturing " the fairy tales by looking at them , in part , from the monsters ' point of view .	in the first episode we meet a creature whose childhood tales were about the scary monster-hunting grimms , who his parents told him could track him down and kill him .	that , says kouf , " is a perspective we 've never heard before . "	gidwitz says the original grimm tales are filled with inspiration for modern entertainment , and they still " retain an intensity and vividness .	when artists and writers go back and read them , they think , ' these are really fresh , and i want to work with this .

a federal judge has refused to delay a pending ruling on how much bp will have to pay in clean water act penalties for the 2010 gulf of mexico oil spill .	the request was made in a motion filed monday by texas lawyer brent coon , who represents plaintiffs with various claims against bp resulting from the spill .	coon had asked for a delay or , as an alternative , a low penalty .	coon argued that a high penalty imposed before all claims are resolved would deter bp from negotiating with various interests who have been harmed by the spill .	u.s. district judge carl barbier rejected coon 's motion without comment in a tuesday order .	barbier completed the third phase of court proceedings on clean water act penalties in february .	a decision is pending , and penalties could exceed $ 13 billion .	the amount will depend on the per-barrel penalty barbier applies , after having already ruled that bp was grossly negligent in connection with the deepwater horizon rig explosion that led to the spill and that 3.19 million barrels of oil was spilled .	the department of justice pushed for maximum penalties .	bp argued for a lighter penalty , saying its response to the spill and the cleanup effort were robust , and it has already run up more than $ 42 billion in costs .
gov. andrew cuomo vowed wednesday to impose a teacher evaluation system on new york city if mayor michael bloomberg and the teachers ' union ca n't agree on one .	conflict between the mayor and the united federation of teachers has already cost city schools $ 250 million in state aid and millions more in federal aid for the past year .	the evaluations are required under a federal grant aimed at improving instruction and by a 2010 law pushed by cuomo , but new york city failed to reach an agreement by the jan. 17 deadline .	now bloomberg and the uft have until september to create an evaluation system for teachers and principals or lose another annual increase in state aid of at least $ 200 million and more federal aid . "	the impasse must be resolved , " the democratic governor said wednesday .	he would direct the state education department to devise a system , then impose it on new york city 's 75,000 teachers .	the union had blamed bloomberg for " intransigence " in negotiations . "	while we would prefer a negotiated settlement , it 's good to know that should the talks fail again , people who actually understand education will be part of the decision-making process , " said michael mulgrew , uft president . "	parents need to know that , thanks to the governor and the legislative leaders , there will be no further risk of the loss of state money for our schools . "	bloomberg had told lawmakers on monday in albany that the uft had no interest in creating evaluations and that the penalty for failing to agree on a system only hurts students . "	we are in active discussions with the uft and , out of respect for those conversations , will reserve comment , " said bloomberg spokeswoman lauren passalacqua .	the measure has the support it will need to become law , if necessary . "	i do n't want to see the children of the city of new york lose $ 250 million in perpetuity because two people ca n't make an agreement , " said assembly speaker sheldon silver . "	i think it is important to put in a system of default to make sure that children do n't lose the resources that those $ 250 million will provide . "	senate republican leader dean skelos of long island , who shares power with democratic sen. jeffrey klein , said he also support cuomo 's measure . "	we ca n't have another situation where the mayor and the union do n't agree and our children suffer , " said klein , a bronx democrat and leader of the independent democratic conference .	cuomo said his plan wo n't be used to impose an evaluation system now to restore the $ 250 million city schools already lost .	cuomo also said he wo n't apply his measure to school districts outside new york , though almost all have agreed to evaluations .
a lawyer for argentina has told a manhattan judge that his orders have caused bondholders to demand $ 4.7 billion since june , creating an " impossible situation " for the south american nation .	attorney carmine boccuzzi said in a letter dated thursday that 25 new lawsuits seeking the bond money have been filed against argentina , worsening the legal threat it faces as it continues to recover from financial troubles .	he told u.s. district judge thomas p. griesa that the lawsuits were filed after the judge ordered argentina earlier this year to pay u.s. hedge funds in full before making interest payments to the majority of the country 's bondholders .	the u.s. bondholders bought argentina bonds on the cheap after argentina in 2001 defaulted on $ 100 billion of debt .	boccuzzi said the u.s. hedge funds that are owed roughly $ 1.5 billion and those bondholders who brought lawsuits since june are among the 8 percent of argentina bondholders who refused to swap their bonds for lesser-valued bonds in 2005 and 2010 .	he said the new multibillion dollar claims had demonstrated the inefficiency of the judge 's orders " and the impossible situation in which they put the republic . "	the lawyer noted that the judge recently expanded a special master 's powers to include negotiations with additional argentina creditors and that additional claims against the republic were likely still to be made .	he said the $ 28 billion that argentina has in reserves must be used for critical macroeconomic purposes and are not available to pay creditors in full , as court judgments require .	much of the debt payments being demanded were " purchased at a deep discount in the secondary market with the aim of extracting through litigation better terms than the vast majority of the republic 's creditors who participated in the republic 's debt restructuring , " he said .	in september , griesa found argentina in contempt of court for its open defiance of his orders .	robert cohen , a lawyer for u.s. bondholders led by billionaire hedge fund investor paul singer 's nml capital ltd. , said in a statement friday that the bondholders who have refused to swap their bonds have provided the judge a constructive way for argentina to resolve its debt dispute with all of its creditors .
a chapter in coast history closed friday with the retirement of u.s. district judge l.t. senter jr. .	senter has retired after presiding for more than five years over hundreds of fractious wind vs. water lawsuits filed in hurricane katrina 's wake .	senter agreed to handle the cases even though he had taken senior status in 1998 from mississippi 's northern district .	he had been on the coast since 2002 to assist the other federal judges with a heavy caseload . "	judge senter , day-in and day-out , month-in and month-out , year-in and year-out , has the best attitude and outlook on life of anyone i 've ever known -- not worked for -- known , " said jerry read , one of two law clerks who helped senter research and write opinions in the cases .	senter can and did make some tough calls , read said , but he is a balanced and compassionate man . "	he has absolute integrity , " read said . "	the judge is 77 and at the top of his form . "	senter said he never realized when he agreed to take on the katrina cases exactly what he was getting into .	his office closed 1,421 katrina cases .	only one case remained on his docket , a whistle-blower lawsuit against state farm .	it will be reassigned to another judge . "	it just floored me , " senter said . "	they were coming so fast and furious .	it was really overwhelming . "	he said former mississippi insurance commissioner george dale 's mediation program seemed like a good model for case resolution .	state rep. jessica upshaw of diamondhead , an attorney , agreed to work as liaison with dale 's office so the court could set up its own program .	senter said the court 's mediation program , managed by law clerk ronnie cochran , was a critical aspect of their work because of the number of cases resolved . "	i 've got to give plenty of credit to those law clerks , " senter said . "	jerry read and ronnie cochran have worked for me before .	they knew how i wanted to handle things .	i did n't like to see a case linger and grow stale . "	the judge also was assisted by two administrators , kimberly overstreet and anne jordan , and by courtroom deputy catherine peters .	senter , a state court judge before he was appointed to the federal bench in 1979 , ruled in the early katrina cases that private insurance policies excluded katrina 's storm surge from coverage .	insurance companies were relieved when senter followed established case law .	the judge also became a hero to beleaguered policyholders when he ruled wind damage is covered even if storm surge contributes to a loss .	insurance companies , he said , had the burden to prove flood caused a loss in order to deny coverage .	the local and national media reported on those early cases . "	i just did n't dream there would be that much ( news coverage ) , " senter said . "	frankly , i just worried also because of the danger that the jury panel would be influenced . "	the courtroom crowd swelled to its largest size in february 2007 , when senter held a hearing to consider a settlement agreement proposed by a group of policyholder attorneys , led by famed lawyer dickie scruggs , and state farm fire & casualty co. .	sheila birnbaum , considered in legal circles to be the world 's leading product-liability attorney , headed state farm 's team .	senter wanted to know how the scruggs legal team intended to earn up to $ 20 million in legal fees outlined in the settlement agreement .	the lawyers were unable to answer this and other questions to senter 's satisfaction .	he rejected the settlement .	senter ruled it failed to protect policyholders .	scruggs , used to getting his way , was livid .	senter said political forces then applied pressure in washington to bring in 100 judges for katrina trials .	he found the idea ill-advised .	thankfully , he said , u.s. supreme court chief justice john roberts agreed , deciding senter , as trial judge , knew best how to manage the caseload . "	to his credit , " senter said , " he just did n't knuckle under to political pressure . "	the tide was running in policyholders ' favor at the time .	the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals changed all that .	the appellate court in september 2007 overturned senter 's decision in a nationwide insurance case , finding wind damage was not covered when water contributed to a loss .	policyholders near the waterfront were left to wonder what hurricane protection their policies did offer .	insurance policies are governed by state law , so the mississippi supreme court is the final authority in this area .	the 5th circuit could have sent the wind vs. water question to the state supreme court instead of reaching its own decision .	instead , a test case did not reach the state 's high court until april 2008 .	the supreme court settled the issue in october 2009 , more than four years after the hurricane .	justices drew the same conclusions senter had reached less than a year after katrina : wind and water cause separate losses .	once the policyholder establishes a direct physical loss under an all-perils policy , the burden shifts to an insurance company to prove water caused the loss in order to deny coverage .	the delay , senter said wednesday , was " tragic . " "	when ( the 5th circuit ) reversed my decision , " he said , " it had a really demoralizing effect on a lot of policyholders who had lawsuits filed , as i was told by plaintiff 's lawyers , so they settled for substantially less than they should have received . "	he might not have known what he was getting into with the insurance cases , senter said , but he would do it again . "	once you see the devastation , as i saw it , and all the people struggling , it just seems like a small , small part for me to try these cases , " he said . "	they deserved a forum to have their cases tried . "

"	these were patients who have chronic sinusitis so , by definition , they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a ct scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses , " smith said .	following the surgery , about 76 percent of patients had " clinically significant " improvement in quality of life , as measured by various validated scales .	patients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure , as did those undergoing surgery for the first time .	this second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with , josephson said .	none of which is to say that patients should n't try medical therapies first , he added . "	i do n't think it means everyone with crs should consider surgery .	they should try medical therapy , and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic , then surgery would be a good tool for them to use , " josephson said . "	some people with stage 1 and 2 diseases may even get cured .	this is a wonderful renewed hope of feeling better .

"	with gastric bypass , there could be some malabsorption of calcium , " he said . "	before and after gastric bypass , patients are routinely told to take at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium daily , and usually 800 milligrams of d , but that may not be enough , " baker said .	monitoring patients closely is crucial , he said . "	no matter which surgery ( of several bariatric surgery options ) they have had done , they need to be monitored for calcium , vitamin d levels and parathyroid hormones long term , " he said .	parathyroid hormones help increase calcium levels in the blood .	an orthopedic surgeon also familiar with the study said that it 's important to remember that the research was reported at a preliminary stage . "	i would be very careful drawing too much from one study , " said dr. leon benson , a professor of orthopedic surgery at the university of chicago , a hand surgery consultant at the illinois bone and joint institute and a spokesman for the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons .	benson said he has not noticed an increase in fracture patients with a history of bariatric surgery .	as for the mechanism , he speculated , like baker , that the higher fracture rate could be linked to absorption issues .	another possibility ? "	maybe the patients lost enough weight ( that ) it changes body image and they have balance issues , " benson said .	for now , people who 've had bariatric surgery " should be as careful as they can to avoid preventable fractures , " he said . "	that means paying close attention to their physician 's advice about their intake of calcium and vitamin d as well as their advice about exercise , which can help keep bones strong .

fifteen months out from the election , the republican race is dominating political coverage both for the extraordinary number of announced candidates and the fact that donald trump , the brash billionaire real estate baron , has taken a strong lead early in the competition despite stirring controversy by labeling mexican immigrants as " criminals " and " rapists " and other remarks .	initially , trump was thought to have no chance in the race , but latest polls show him far outdistancing mainstream republican candidates who had been expected to wage a three - or four-way battle for the nomination before trump unexpectedly jumped into the contest in june .	however , his negative numbers in the polls are also high and most observers are skeptical about his chances of securing the nomination .	an establishment republican candidate was seen as emerging to compete in the general election against former secretary of state hillary clinton , who was expected to coast to the democratic nomination with little or no challenge .	but that race also has surprised political experts with the unexpected candidacy and strength of vermont senator bernie sanders , a self-described socialist who caucuses in democrats .	and in recent days there were reports that vice president joe biden is seriously considering a late entry into the democratic contest .	but nothing tops trump 's surprising captivation of republican voters .	some polls show his backing has grown to nearly double that of former florida gov. jeb bush , once the front-runner .	initially , trump was thought to have no chance after announcing his candidacy with a speech that offended mexican immigrants .	he later debunked the hero status of sen. john mccain , imprisoned and tortured for five years by north vietnam .	political observers had expected those comments to sink trump 's candidacy before it had really set sail .	instead he has struck a deep vein of discontent with conservative republican voters .	trump and two other republicans were absent from the stage during a key forum in the state new hampshire on monday night when the rest of the field took part in a kind of warmup ahead of the thursday debate .	new hampshire holds the first primary election next february in the state-by-state contests to choose the nominee .	the gathering offered a prime-time practice round for most of the would-be debaters , who addressed several contentious issues , immigration topping a list that also included abortion and climate change .	without exception , the candidates on monday aimed their criticism at democrats instead of each other in a two-hour faceoff .	trump was not mentioned .	fox has not said which polls it would use to determine the top 10 candidates .	several surveys have been released in recent days , with more expected tuesday .	the margins could make a difference for candidates separated by 1 or 2 points .	a monmouth university survey released monday found that only five candidates -- trump , bush , wisconsin gov. scott walker , texas sen. ted cruz , and former arkansas gov. mike huckabee -- are definitely in the top tier of candidates .

sometime in the next few months , administrators at pennsylvania regional ballet expect to hear that they will be receiving a $ 7,000 state grant , money that will pay choreographers to create dance pieces for their spring concert .	that 's about the same amount the 150-student school in east pennsboro township received from pennsylvania council on the arts this year .	but after a bruising state budget struggle in harrisburg that nearly slashed arts funding to the bone before an 11th-hour rescue , the money will feel like an unexpected gift . "	we were worried , " prb executive director kathy aumiller said . "	if they had cut what they said they were going to cut , i do n't think there would have been any money for anyone but philadelphia and pittsburgh . "	and that 's where funding for arts and culture stands in pennsylvania .	treading water now feels like a victory . "	that 's a good way of putting it , " jeff woodruff , executive director of the harrisburg symphony orchestra , said . "	holding your own is about the best you can hope for at the present time . "	some believe the last-minute decision by the republican-controlled legislature to restore millions of dollars in pca funding in this year 's spending plan might mark a turning point in state support after several years of declines .	over the past three budget cycles , pca grants have dropped by 46 percent while state aid to public broadcasters such as witf and cultural institutions such as harrisburg 's whitaker center for science and the arts , which once totaled millions of dollars annually , has been eliminated . "	we are hoping that this is the nadir for arts funding in pennsylvania , " said karim olaecha , spokesman for the greater philadelphia cultural alliance , which funnels pca grant money to arts and culture groups in southeastern pennsylvania . "	what starts now is the process of trying to reinstitute and rebuild the state 's commitment to the arts . "	more battles ahead barring a remarkable economic turnaround in the next year , however , more tough budget choices can be expected next year .	this was , after all , a year when millions of dollars in budget cuts were made , affecting public education , colleges , the corrections system , public welfare and the environment , among others .	and lawmakers are eyeing more cuts . "	this is a small step in the right direction , " rep. daryl metcalfe , r-butler , told the patriot-news following final approval of the $ 27.15 billion budget in late june . "	but we have far more to do to actually protect taxpayers of this state from the excesses of the past . "	that means arts groups likely will need to be ready to defend their turf again next year . "	we have to consider ourselves extremely fortunate and be ready to work really hard , " said robert c. welsh , executive director of jump street , a nonprofit organization in harrisburg that supports a variety of arts-based initiatives . "	yes , it 's good to still be in the battle , and yes , it will be a battle . "	jump street disseminates pca program and project grants to arts groups in dauphin , lebanon and cumberland counties .	in the most recent year , according to program coordinator melissa snyder , that meant 35 grants worth a total of about $ 72,000 .	among the recipients was pennsylvania regional ballet .	the $ 7,000 grant was not a make-or-break amount for prb , but aumiller said it 's crucial nonetheless .	the ability to bring in noted choreographers from around the country enables the school 's pre-professional students to get real-world ballet experience and gives the school fresh material for its public performances each spring . "	that 's a big part of the mission of what we do , " aumiller said . "	without that money , i 'm not sure what we would do .	i mean , we 'd look for the money elsewhere , but it 's not easy to find $ 7,000 these days . "	hso receives about $ 26,000 annually from pca through a separate funding track called arts organizations and arts programs .	again , it might not be a huge sum , but it 's one that would be difficult to replace . "	to us , that 's a significant amount , " woodruff said . "	that 's about 1 percent of our budget , really . "	the harrisburg symphony orchestra and pennsylvania regional ballet were nearly left hanging this year when the house appropriations committee abruptly voted in may to cut pca grant funding by 70 percent , or about $ 6 million .	such a cut would effectively have gutted the agency and left the state in 46th place nationwide in per-capita funding for the arts . "	it would have changed everything , " pca executive director philip horn said . "	i do n't know how we could have sustained our partnerships around the state . "	the move was a little surprising , because the republican-controlled house was making a cut that the new republican governor had not sought .	gov. tom corbett had proposed a $ 9.1 million budget for pca , about the same as the previous year . "	i was n't expecting it this time , " horn said of the drastic cut , which came about two years after the state senate had voted to eliminate pca from the budget .	that time , the agency was saved late in the game by an agreement among legislators and democratic gov. ed rendell , although its budget was cut substantially . "	before that , we had gone 16 years without any effort from any quarter to reduce our budget , " horn said . "	now , we 've nearly been zeroed out two of the last three years . "	this year , the senate republicans came to pca 's rescue . "	we insisted on putting that money back in , " sen. rich alloway , r-franklin county , said . "	( the arts ) are an important part of the fabric of life in our communities .	the debate edged close to the sort of infighting the republicans had pledged to avoid after taking firm control of the legislative and executive branches in the 2010 election , mostly reducing democrats to spectators .	many also thought first lady susan corbett 's role as chairwoman of pca would serve to shield the council from legislative cost cutting .	susan corbett , along with dozens of arts groups , lobbied for restoration of some or all of the funding , pointing out the economic value of the arts .	according to the greater philadelphia cultural alliance , arts and culture generate almost $ 2 billion in economic impact across the state and are responsible for about 62,000 direct and indirect jobs .	the first lady later expressed satisfaction with the outcome . "	this will ensure that pennsylvania council on the arts can continue its support of artists , arts organizations and programs in all 67 counties , " she said after the budget was signed by her husband . "	i especially want to thank all those who contacted their legislators to articulate the benefits of investing in pennsylvania 's arts and cultural assets .	your efforts made a difference . "	but the in-house struggle left arts supporters statewide wondering aloud : why is it that a state with so many world-class orchestras , museums , theaters and dance companies keeps getting so little respect from its own lawmakers ? "	this state has such a strong sense of place , " horn said . "	it 's so incredibly rich in arts and culture and history .	it would be a shame to lose that . "	olaecha and others are still trying to puzzle out exactly what happened at the capitol this spring . "	we spoke to everyone we could and no one seems to know why the 70 percent cut was proposed in the first place , " olaecha said .	one positive outcome is that the corbetts and many leading lawmakers of both parties appear to be supportive of the arts .	what remains to be seen is how that will play out in the future . "	it 's a victory in that we avoided a 70 percent cut in funding , but the reality is that arts and culture have already been trimmed to the bone , " olaecha said .

the proposed ban would apply to immigrants and visitors alike , a sweeping prohibition affecting all adherents of islam who want to come to the u.s. .	the idea faced an immediate challenge to its legality and feasibility from experts who could point to no formal exclusion of immigrants based on religion in america 's history .	trump 's campaign said in a statement such a ban should stand " until our country 's representatives can figure out what is going on . "	it said the proposal comes in response to a level of hatred among " large segments of the muslim population " toward americans . "	until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses , our country can not be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad , and have no sense of reason or respect for human life , " trump said in the statement .	at an evening rally in south carolina , trump supporters cheered and shouted in support as he read his statement .	trump warned during his speech that without drastic action , the threat of attacks is " going to get worse and worse . " "	as he says , we have to find out who they are and why they are here , " rod weader , a 68-year-old real estate agent from north charleston who attended the rally and said he agreed with trump 's plan " 150 percent . " ''	like he said , they are going to kill us and we 've got to stop it . "	since the paris attacks , a number of republican presidential contenders have proposed restrictions on syrian refugees -- with several suggesting preference for christians seeking asylum -- and tighter surveillance in the u.s. .	but trump 's proposed ban goes much further than those ideas , and his republican rivals were quick to reject the latest provocation from a candidate who has delivered no shortage of them . "	donald trump is unhinged , " jeb bush said via twitter . "	his ' policy ' proposals are not serious . "	john kasich slammed trump 's " outrageous divisiveness , " while a more measured ted cruz , who has always been cautious about upsetting trump 's supporters , said , " well , that is not my policy . "	trump 's plan also drew criticism from the heads of the republican party in iowa , new hampshire and south carolina , the first three states to vote in next year 's presidential primaries .	new hampshire gop 's chairwoman jennifer horn said the idea is " un-republican .	it is unconstitutional .	and it is un-american , " while south carolina chairman matt moore said on twitter , " as a conservative who truly cares about religious liberty , donald trump 's bad idea and rhetoric send a shiver down my spine . "	trump campaign manager corey lewandowski said trump 's proposed ban would apply to " everybody , " including muslims seeking immigration visas as well as tourists seeking to enter the country .	his campaign did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would also include muslims who are u.s. citizens and travel outside of the country , including members of the military , or how a determination of someone 's religion might be made by customs and border officials .	instead , trump said via a campaign spokeswoman : " because i am so politically correct , i would never be the one to say .	you figure it out ! "	there are more than 5,800 servicemen and women on active u.s. military duty and in the reserves who self-identify as muslim and could be assigned to serve overseas .	trump said in an interview monday night on fox news , " they 'll come home . "	he added , " this does not apply to people living in the country , except that we have to vigilant . "	it was also unclear whether trump 's ban would apply to muslim allies in the fight against islamic state militants .	ari fleischer , a former aide to republican president george w. bush , tweeted , " under trump , the king abdullah of jordan , who is fighting isis , wo n't be allowed in the us to talk about how to fight isis . "	but at trump 's rally in south carolina , the proposed ban struck supporter shelley choquette as reasonable , because " it 's not going to be forever .	i think everybody needs to be checked . "	religion can factor into immigration decisions , but that typically happens when people are fleeing religious persecution .	people of a particular religion may get favorable treatment by the united states , as when russian jews sought to leave the soviet union .	in the late 1800s , congress passed legislation broadly aimed at halting chinese immigration .	but said leti volpp , a university of california expert on immigration law , " there is no precedent for a religious litmus test for admitting immigrants into the united states . " "	excluding almost a quarter of the world 's population from setting foot in the united states based solely upon their religious identity would never pass constitutional muster , " volpp said .	trump 's proposal comes a day after president barack obama spoke to the nation from the oval office about the shootings in san bernardino , california , which obama said was " an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people . "	the fbi said monday the muslim couple who carried out the massacre had been radicalized and had taken target practice at area gun ranges , in one case within days of the attack last week that killed 14 people .	trump 's campaign has been marked by a pattern of inflammatory statements , dating back to his harsh rhetoric about mexican immigrants .	he has taken a particularly hard line against muslims in the days since the paris attacks , advocating enhanced surveillance of mosques due to fears over radicalization . "	donald trump sounds more like a leader of a lynch mob than a great nation like ours , " said nihad awad , national executive director of the council on american-islamic relations . "	he and others are playing into the hands of isis .	this is exactly what isis wants from americans : to turn against each other . "	white house spokesman josh earnest accused trump of playing on people 's fears and trying to tap into " a darker side , a darker element " of american society .	from the democratic presidential campaign , bernie sanders said " trump and others want us to hate all muslims " and hillary clinton called the proposal " reprehensible , prejudiced and divisive .

when connie achterberg started practicing law more than 60 years , there were very few women attorneys .	while attending the university of kansas in the early 1950s , connie achterberg often would pass a group of underclassmen sitting on the stoop of the campus law school building .	as attractive female students would walk by , the boys would wolf whistle and make suggestive comments .	when young achterberg walked toward the building , however , they kept their mouths shut and greeted her with respect . "	they let me go through without exhibiting such behavior , " she said . "	i did n't feel put-upon by the boys there .	they treated me well . "	the respect was well-earned .	at that time , achterberg was only one of three women enrolled in her class at the university of kansas school of law .	this was during a period when most women became homemakers instead of professionals , and the law profession was primarily a boy 's club .	yet achterberg was able to turn her devotion to the law into a career spanning more than 60 years , first as an attorney for the kansas highway commission and then since 1959 in private practice in salina .	when achterberg first moved to salina to open a law office , there were no other female attorneys .	now , she said , salina has at least 20 .	achterberg 's own law firm , achterberg , angell & craft , has three : herself , samantha angell and catherine craft . "	having an all-female law firm makes me very happy , " achterberg said .	at age 85 , achterberg no longer has to work , but she continues to come to the office at 110 s. seventh nearly every day and some saturdays , where she helps clients with estate planning , probate matters and business , tax and real estate laws . "	i still work a full day , " she said . "	i like doing this , and i do n't know what else i would do with my days .	you can only sit home and read so much . "	achterberg believes she provides a valuable service for clients during an often stressful and emotional time of their lives . "	by the nature of the work i do , i do a lot of work with older people , " she said . "	by this time , i 've worked with multiple generations .	they can trust me , or they would n't be here . "	during her long career , achterberg has won numerous awards for her contributions to the legal profession .	she was the first recipient of the kansas bar association 's professionalism award and received its distinguished service award .	she also was the first woman to receive the distinguished alumna award from the university of kansas school of law .	achterberg was born in grand island , neb. , and grew up on a farm near lincoln , kan. .	she developed an early interest in the law from her father , who farmed and worked for northern natural gas , where he wrote contracts and purchased land for pipelines . "	that perked my interest in the law , but i had n't really settled on it , " achterberg said . "	there were n't many female lawyers around at that time . "	achterberg graduated from northwestern university in 1950 with a bachelor 's degree in political science .	in 1953 , she earned a law degree at ku .	after graduation , achterberg was hired as an attorney by the kansas highway commission .	during the formative years of the interstate highway system championed by president dwight d. eisenhower , achterberg spent four years traveling throughout the state trying cases on behalf of the commission .	although achterberg said she loved that job , after four years she wanted to settle in one place and open a general practice , the salina journal ( http://bit.ly/1fq1ulj ) reports . "	i settled in salina because it was close to home , and the highway commission told me if i came here , they would send some local cases for me to work on , " achterberg said .	achterberg opened her first law office in salina just across the street from her present office at 110 s. seventh .	she rented an upstairs space from salinan bob frederick , who owned an abstract company downstairs .	for the first few years of her practice , securing new clients was not easy , especially for a female attorney .	when achterberg joined the american association of university women , she said it helped jump-start her career . "	many of these women were from western kansas , and a number of them wanted to go to a woman lawyer , " achterberg said . "	they helped me a lot in those days .	people usually went to male lawyers , so it would have been hard to get started otherwise . "	achterberg tried court-appointed criminal cases but did n't like that area of the law .	her specialty became estate law , where she helped children with their parents ' estates and " did a few tax returns when tax season was around . " "	i felt it was a useful service , and i liked to do it , " she said .	achterberg said she got along well with the male lawyers in town ?	in fact , she ended up marrying one : c.l. clark , of the law firm clark , mize & linville , in 1972 .	clark died in 2004 .	the couple had no children .	after about 20 years on her own , achterberg professionally partnered with another local attorney , pat neustrom , to found the firm achterberg & neustrom .	neustrom said he and achterberg were partners for 28 years and still co-own the building together .	neustrom now has his own firm , neustrom & associates .	neustrom said achterberg is a true pioneer for women attorneys in the state . "	she is a good lawyer , with high character , " neustrom said . "	she creates relationships with her clients and takes care of them .	there 's about 2,000 people she sends christmas cards to that she remembers . "	during her long career , achterberg was saline county counselor from 1973 to 1988 and was appointed to the board of governors for the kansas university law society from 1994 to 1997 .	she is a member of the saline/ottawa county bar association , kansas bar association and kansas bar foundation .	from 1992 to 1994 , she served on the kansas supreme court nominating committee .	achterberg 's office has been in three different locations in the same south seventh building , the last at the far north end of the building . "	there 's no place else we can go except the parking lot , " she said .	angell was hired by achterberg in early 2000 , soon after angell graduated from washburn university , in topeka .	when angell became a full partner in early 2005 , the firm 's name was changed to achterberg & angell .	craft was added as a partner in 2014 . "	i had known a little bit about connie through a retired kansas supreme court justice , harold herd , who was a professor at washburn , " angell said . "	he told me i could n't find a better mentor than connie . "	angell said achterberg has been a role model for her and other female ?	and male ?	attorneys through the years . "	in the 15 years i 've worked with her , i 've never heard her say a disparaging thing about anyone , " angell said . "	whether it 's a client , a judge or another attorney , she never takes anything personally . "	angell said she admires achterberg for being the lone female attorney in salina until attorney karen black moved to town a few years after achterberg . "	she paved the way for the rest of us , but not in a way that was loud or obnoxious , " angell said . "	she came here , did her job and mentored other female attorneys .	she made it easier for all of us . "	while achterberg realizes she 's been practicing law for more than 60 years , she does n't feel any need to retire . "	it seems almost like yesterday that i started , " she said . "	i 'm called a female pioneer in law in the state , but i did n't think of myself as that at the time .	i was just doing a job . "

" "	its location near current river state park and minutes away from the beloved montauk state park will provide visitors great opportunities to enhance their missouri state parks experience in the ozarks , " bryan said .	he said monday that plans for developing the land were still being worked out , and more land acquisitions could be at hand .

"	it 's such a critical function for the military and it 's such an important thing for our community , from an economic development perspective , and to make sure that this base and airport continues to function at a high capacity , " bennett said .

the newly elected prime minister of tibet 's government-in-exile predicted wednesday that the 76-year-old dalai lama will return during his lifetime to the homeland he fled five decades ago .	in dharmsala , india , the tibetan spiritual leader 's exile headquarters , harvard legal scholar lobsang sangay was declared on wednesday the winner of a vote cast by tens of thousands of tibetans around the world , after the buddhist leader said he wanted to devolve political authority to an elected leader .	sangay grew up as a refugee and his father , a former monk , fought as a guerrilla against china 's occupation of tibet .	sangay told reporters in washington he would seek to restore the freedom , dignity and identity of tibetans .	he also vowed to reach out to china and pursue the dalai lama 's stated desire for greater autonomy for tibetans within china . "	tibet is under occupation .	there is political repression , ethnic assimilation , economic marginalization and environmental destruction , " said the 43-year-old , dressed in a smart business suit .	he said that if china wanted to become a new world superpower , it could not do so through economic or military might , but would need to exercise moral authority in how it treats people .	he urged beijing to review its " hard-line " tibet policy and take a " more moderate and liberal approach . "	he said the government-in-exile remained ready for negotiations .	nine previous rounds of talks have made no headway .	while the tibetan government-in-exile has existed for decades , it has long been seen as a powerless reflection of the wishes of the dalai lama , who is worshipped as a near-deity by many followers .	ceding his political powers is widely seen as a way to prepare for the spiritual leader 's death and to show beijing that exile leaders will continue to wield influence .	sangay said the dalai lama remains healthy and strong and maintains a punishing schedule . "	he will live very long .	i believe we will see he will return to tibet in his lifetime , " sangay said .	china occupied tibet in 1950 and claims the region has been part of its territory for centuries .	many tibetans , who are linguistically and ethnically distinct , say they were effectively independent .	while china has made strides to develop the remote region , tibetans fear they are being marginalized economically and that their religion is under threat from restrictions imposed by the authoritarian government in beijing .	the dalai lama fled into exile in northern india in 1959 .	sangay said he will join the spiritual leader in dharmsala by mid-may .	sangay and the other members of the parliament-in-exile , whose election victories also were announced wednesday , will be sworn in on may 30 in dharmsala .

"	i think we 've given plenty of hints as to who may die ?	perhaps too many , in that every one of our lead characters is left in a dire , life-threatening situation the month before , " brevoort told the associated press . "	so , hopefully , that will help to heighten the suspense , while preserving the surprise as to which member does n't make it out alive . "	marvel is taking no chances in trying to contain that secret like it were the wish-granting cosmic cube itself .	readers will find out for themselves when " fantastic four " no. 587 is released in january , though it 'll be wrapped in a black polybag designed to keep snoops from finding out and spilling the news .	it wo n't appear on newsstands , either . "	the surprises in this issues ?	and what comes next ?	constitute one of the biggest events in marvel history , " said david gabriel , senior vice president for sales and circulation at marvel .	but is death really the end and , more so , will it be permanent ?	after all , death has visited the fantastic four , which was created by stan lee and jack kirby and first appeared in 1961 , before .	sue storm , the invisible woman , supposedly died , but that was just a ruse .	similarly , her husband , reed richards , aka mr. fantastic , was thought dead after being caught in a blast with his archenemy , dr. doom .	instead of death , however , richards and his nemesis were snatched away to another dimension .	this time , however , marvel is adamant , noting that once the current story ends in no. 588 , the fantastic four will cease to exist . "	we 've been building to this story and this moment since jonathan began writing the series around a year and a half ago , " brevoort said . "	it 's a story that will have a transformative effect on these characters ?	virtually nothing will be the same after the events of this story .	and that was the reason to go this route ?	to bring about these seismic changes to the characters and to the series . "	marvel editor-in-chief joe quesada said the story is part of a wider effort to not only keep readers entertained , but engaged . "	the beauty of the marvel universe is that it is in constant change .	things are always happening , very much like life itself , " he told ap . "	for us , being stagnant just means that we 're not doing our job .	at the end of the day , its about characters , soap opera , dramatic events and things that keep our readers coming back for that next installment .

all major segments of michigan 's public education system , including community colleges , would face funding cuts under proposals advanced wednesday by republicans who control the state legislature .	the republican-led senate appropriations committee voted to cut community college funding by about 3.4 percent , or roughly $ 10 million , in the budget year that begins in october .	the measure next goes to the senate floor .	republican gov. rick snyder proposed holding community college funding steady next fiscal year , one of the relatively few programs he would n't cut in his $ 45.9 billion overall budget proposal .	but plans in both the senate and house propose cuts to the two-year colleges .	a measure that could soon come up for a vote in the house appropriations committee would slash community college funding by roughly 15 percent , mirroring the state aid cuts that universities likely will face next fiscal year . "	these are tough times , and tough decisions must be made , " sen. darwin booher , a republican from evart , said while outlining the senate 's proposed cuts to community colleges .	democrats oppose the cuts , saying community colleges need the money to help retrain michigan workers who lost their jobs in recent years .	universities and k-12 schools are even more likely to face substantial cuts , although proposals vary between snyder and republicans who control the state legislature .	public school districts can expect a continuation of the $ 170 per student reduction that 's already in place for the current fiscal year .	a house subcommittee recommended wednesday that schools be cut next year by an additional 3.9 percent ?	a reduction that would range from $ 285 to $ 331 per student , depending on what districts now receive from the state .	snyder has proposed an additional $ 300 across-the-board per student cut for next fiscal year .	a senate plan calls for an additional cut of $ 170 per student .	democrats are opposed to all of the education cuts , but the k-12 measures seemed to draw the most concern wednesday .	democrats say the reductions will lead to more teacher layoffs and program cuts at michigan schools , some of which already are struggling with their finances .	rep. lisa brown , a democrat from west bloomfield , said the proposed school aid budget " is an attempt to balance the budget on the backs of our children . "	universities are likely to get a reduction of roughly 15 percent under all republican plans .	there are differences , however , in how it would be implemented and how much school aid fund money would be used to support universities and community colleges .

all recreational motorboats should be required to display passenger limits , a lawmaker said sunday , pressing the coast guard to take action after three children died when a yacht carrying 27 people capsized july 4 . "	in the memory of the children we lost on that awful day , we can take some simple steps to educate and warn boat owners and their passengers how many people a vessel can safely handle , " u.s. sen. charles schumer said , with relatives of one of the slain children echoing his call .	the children and two dozen other people were on a 34-foot-long motor yacht to watch independence day fireworks off long island when the boat overturned and sank .	victoria gaines , 7 ; david aureliano , 12 , and his cousin , harlie treanor , 11 , were trapped in the cabin and died .	authorities are investigating whether overcrowding , a mechanical problem , weather conditions or other factors played a part in the capsizing .	safety experts have said the boat was overcrowded , but the skipper has blamed the tragedy on a sudden wave .	the vessel , the kandi won , was raised wednesday from the bottom of oyster bay and taken to a marina for a preliminary inspection .	under a 1971 federal law , engine-powered boats 20 feet long or smaller generally must display a plate showing their maximum passenger count and weight load .	schumer is urging the same for larger boats . "	it does n't make much sense that we require capacity limits be posted for mostly everything from ballrooms to classrooms , and boats under 20 feet in size , but not recreational vessels over 20 feet , " he said in a release .	the coast guard has authority to expand the requirement without a change in the underlying law , according to schumer , who put his proposal in a letter to u.s. coast guard commandant adm. robert papp .	a message left for the coast guard was n't immediately returned sunday .	paul gaines , victoria 's father , said the proposal " would be a huge step forward . " "	while we explore what exactly went wrong during this trip , it 's vital we do everything possible to ensure that no family ever has to experience the grief that we are currently going through , " he said .

san francisco will be the first major american city to prohibit fast-food restaurants from including toys with children 's meals that do n't meet nutritional guidelines .	the city 's board of supervisors voted 8-3 in favor of the measure tuesday .	that 's enough votes to survive a veto by mayor gavin newsom .	the measure passed on a preliminary vote by the board last week .	the ordinance , which would go into effect in december of next year , prohibits toy giveaways in fast food children 's meals that have 640 milligrams of sodium , 600 calories or 35 percent of their calories from fat .	the law also would limit saturated fats and trans fats and require fruits or vegetables to be served with each meal with a toy .	this is a breaking news update .	check back soon for further information .	ap 's earlier story is below .	san francisco ( ap ) ?	it 's a happy moment for people who see the happy meal as anything but .	san francisco is poised to become the first major american city to prohibit fast food restaurants from including toys with children 's meals that do not meet nutritional guidelines .	the measure passed on a preliminary vote by the city 's board of supervisors last week , and is expected to win final passage tuesday with enough votes to survive a likely veto by mayor gavin newsom .	the ordinance , which would go into effect in december of next year , prohibits toy giveaways in fast food children 's meals that have more than 640 milligrams of sodium , 600 calories or 35 percent of their calories from fat .	the law also would limit saturated fats and trans fats and require fruits or vegetables to be served with each meal with a toy .	the legislation is a big victory for activists and public health advocates who have charged food marketers with being complicit in the country 's growing childhood obesity rates .	they hope other cities and counties nationwide will follow their lead . "	this will be a sign to the fast-food industry that it 's time to phase out its predatory marketing to children at large , " said deborah lapidus , a senior organizer with boston-based corporate accountability international , a watchdog group that supported the legislation .	a similar ordinance has already been approved in california 's santa clara county , where it affected about a dozen restaurants .	the industry , which favors self-regulation , says there is no evidence that san francisco 's law will halt the expanse of children 's waistlines and the diseases associated with obesity , such as hypertension , diabetes and heart disease .	mcdonald 's and burger king corp. are among 17 major food and beverage marketers who have signed on to the children 's food and beverage advertising initiative , a self-regulation effort run by the council of better business bureaus .	mcdonald 's says its meals advertised to children meet government nutritional standards , limiting total calories to 600 per meal and capping fats and sugars .	the company also agreed to curtail advertising in schools and promote healthy lifestyles in all marketing efforts directed at children . "	mcdonald 's remains committed to responsible marketing practices , including advertising and promotional campaigns for our youngest customers , " mcdonald 's senior vice president for marketing , neil golden , said in a statement to the associated press .	mcdonald 's sent several senior executives and others to san francisco to oppose the measure in person .	as it was being drafted , amended and discussed over several months , corporate accountability ran a local newspaper advertisement signed by physicians , community activists and small restaurants that called on board of supervisors swing voter bevan dufty to support the measure .	dufty eventually did so , saying san francisco should not wait for the federal government to act and should serve as an example to other cities . "	i do n't care how much they say , ' it 's san francisco , they 're whacked out there , it does n't matter , ' the reality is they 're taking notice , " dufty said .	fast-food restaurants spent $ 161 million advertising to children under 12 and an estimated $ 360 million on toys distributed with their meals in 2006 , according to a 2008 federal trade commission report .	marlene schwartz , deputy director of yale university 's rudd center for food policy & obesity , said fast food advertising aimed at children has increased since self-regulation efforts began . "	they 're only really promoting it halfheartedly , " said schwartz of healthier food options .	san francisco 's law " is making the restaurants practice what they preach . "	the lure of such items is all too familiar to parents like carmen sanchez , who was at a san francisco mcdonald 's on a recent evening and said she sometimes hears children beg for happy meals . "	if the babies do n't get what they want , then they wo n't stop crying , " sanchez said .

the number of public school teachers has reached a decade-low in california , and the job is getting less attractive amid state budget cuts , a new study says .	the budget problems have boosted class sizes , interfered with teacher training and reduced support from school counselors , nurses and aides , according to the report released monday by the not-for-profit center for the future of teaching and learning , a research and advocacy group based in santa cruz . "	the budget cuts have severely damaged the teacher pipeline , but all the systems that support good teaching are really compromised , " center director margaret gaston told the monterey county herald . "	that 's really the main message . "	the study showed the number of teachers in california is now at its lowest level in a decade ?	just under 300,000 this year , compared to 310,361 in 2008 ?	because fewer people are entering the profession .	the number of people enrolled in university teacher training programs fell from more than 75,000 to fewer than 45,000 between 2002 and 2008 , the study said .	the center said the trend could produce a significant teacher shortage in the future even as some districts have resorted to layoffs to make ends meet .	california superintendent of public instruction jack o'connell said the prospect of a shortage was worrisome because schools are under ever-increasing pressure to reduce gaps in achievement between wealthy and low-income students and to make sure all high graduates are prepared to go on to college . "	unfortunately , as the report points out , the state budget crisis is ratcheting down the pipeline of prospective new teachers just as we face the need to replace nearly a third of our teaching force anticipated to retire , " o'connell said .

occupy wall street has risen anew to transform itself into a lauded and effective relief organization for victims of superstorm sandy .	the social media savvy that helped occupy protesters create a grass-roots global movement last year ?	one that ultimately collapsed under its leaderless format ?	is proving to be a strength as members fan out across new york to deliver aid , including hot meals , medicine and blankets .	they 're the ones who took food and water to glenn nisall , a 53-year-old resident of queens ' hard-hit and isolated rockaway section who lost power and lives alone , with no family nearby . "	i said : ' occupy ?	you mean occupy wall street ? ' "	he said . "	i said : ' awesome , man .	i 'm one of the 99 percent , you know ? ' "	occupy wall street was born in late 2011 in a lower manhattan plaza called zuccotti park , with a handful of protesters pitching tents and vowing to stay put until world leaders offered a fair share to the " 99 percent " who do n't control the globe 's wealth .	the world heard the cry as that camp grew and inspired other ones around the globe .	ultimately , though , little was accomplished in the ways of policy change , and occupy became largely a punch line .	but core members , and a spirit , have persisted and found a new cause in occupy sandy .	it started at st. jacobi church in brooklyn the day after the storm , where occupiers set up a base of operations and used social media like twitter and facebook to spread the word .	there is a sense of camaraderie reminiscent of zuccotti , as young people with scruffy beards and walkie-talkies plan the day 's activities .	donations come in by the truckload and are sorted in the basement , which looks like a clearinghouse for every household product imaginable , from canned soup and dog food to duvet covers .

"	there 's not a boss to tell you that you ca n't do this or you ca n't do that .	zuccotti was one of the best trainings in how to mobilize so quickly .

as illinois ' minimum wage workers awaited a pay boost to $ 8.25 an hour on thursday , the democratic and republican candidates for governor dueled over whether the minimum is too high ?	or should go even higher .	speaking tuesday at edna 's , a celebrated west side chicago soul food restaurant , democratic gov. pat quinn signaled the minimum wage issue will play a fundamental part in his campaign and said " a principle as old as the bible " is at stake : that hard work should n't mean living in poverty .	quinn said he supports indexing illinois ' minimum wage to inflation , as about 10 other states do .	he sharply criticized republican bill brady for suggesting the minimum wage should be rolled back by $ 1 to the federal level , which quinn said would amount to a $ 2,000 annual pay cut for thousands of families . "	all these heroic people who get up every day and work hard to raise a family ... to tell them they 're going to have their wages cut by $ 2,000 a year is just plain heartless and it 's shameful , " quinn said .	he said he " wo n't let a day go by " without letting people know how he differs from brady on the minimum wage .	brady , the state senator from bloomington , countered that quinn 's policies have pushed jobs to neighboring states .	brady said the federal minimum wage should be allowed to catch up with the illinois minimum wage .	he appeared to back away from his earlier call to roll back the state 's minimum wage by $ 1 an hour to match the federal level .	illinois should just wait and catch up , then stay level with the federal minimum wage , he told reporters after a city club luncheon speech tuesday . "	my position is we need a governor who will bring jobs back to illinois , " brady said . "	you can argue about what the wage would be , but if you do n't have a job to tie to the wage , there 's no value for an illinois family . "	brady suggested quinn 's focus on the minimum wage is meant to draw attention away from the state 's unemployment rate , which is at 10.8 percent . "	his policies have pushed jobs to neighboring states at the expense of illinois families , " brady said of quinn .	the minimum wage in states bordering illinois is at the federal level , according to the illinois department of labor .	on thursday , the last scheduled increase in the state 's minimum wage takes effect , a result of 2006 legislation passed by a democratic-controlled legislature .	the state 's minimum wage , earned by about 390,000 workers , will be $ 1 higher than the federal minimum .	someone working 40 hours a week at $ 8.25 an hour makes $ 17,160 a year .
tonya smith-byrd was ready to drop out of kentucky state university .	she had exhausted all options ?	scholarships , federal aid , student loans and money from her parents ?	but she still could n't afford tuition . "	my plan was to not come back , " she said . "	but then my mom contacted the school to help me transfer and found out about this program . "	that program is green 2 gold , an alternative to federal work study established to fill the gap between available aid and the cost of attending school while providing real-world work experience .	tuition at ksu is $ 3,530 per 15-credit hour semester for residents and $ 8,478 for out-of-state students ?	and that does n't take into consideration the cost of books , housing and living expenses . "	there 's a big gap between what i can contribute and what my bursar account says , " smith-byrd said .	she 's not alone .	research from the office of institutional research and effectiveness shows personal finances play a big part in a student 's persistence at ksu , meaning many students consider dropping out or transferring if they ca n't pay down their account fast enough .	anthony bowles , supervisor at the student one stop shop , said some students are asked to pay between $ 2,200 and $ 4,400 per year after financial aid and scholarship are accounted for . "	those are the students i refer to green 2 gold , " he said .	green 2 gold offers students up to $ 1,500 per year for their time and service , which often averages 20 hours a week .	to be eligible for the program , students must have at least a 2.0 gpa , a current balance on their bursar and must have exhausted all other financial aid opportunities . "	some students just do n't want to take out those loans , " arthur mckee , the program 's director , said .	but it pays off for those students who are willing to go into debt to further their education and commit to the green 2 gold program , he said .	those students ?	there are more than 100 enrolled in the program this semester , with president mary sias hoping to grow that number in the future ?	receive a career coach and real-world professional experience .	the university spent about $ 300,000 on the program in its first two years , when 250 students participated .	the funds come from tuition increases over the past four years , a portion of which has been dedicated to financial aid .	mckee was hired to lead the ksu program ?	with the administrative assistance of annette bruce in the office of career counseling placement and cooperative education ?	because of his decades of experience in state government . "	i do n't know university politics , " he said . "	i teach people how to work . "	he coaches the students on how to dress , the importance of showing up on time , limiting cell phone use and how to conduct themselves professionally in an office environment ?	and he does so candidly .	he said he wants to correct any potential problems before they appear in the office . "	he 's trying to get us prepared for the real world , " junior brittney benson said .	mckee said he calls it being transparent .	smith-byrd was placed at the one-stop shop , where she helps process loans for students .	she 's majoring in business marketing , so she will be working with loans and consulting in the future . "	i really do think what i 'm doing will help me , " she said .	tianna henry was n't so sure about her placement at first .	the sophomore is a nursing student , but she was assigned to work in the president 's office doing " whatever , whenever " the staff needs .	she soon realized the placement was pushing her to develop applicable skills she could use anywhere , like how to interact with coworkers and how to file paperwork .	she plans to stay with the program and will aim for a placement with frankfort regional medical center in the future . "	you 've got to crawl before you walk , " henry said .	for corlia logsdon , the green 2 gold program is a " win-win . "	logsdon is the assistant director of human resources for disability services , and her office is one of the most popular placements for students ?	especially those with an interest in teaching or social services . "	we ran out of federal funds for extra help , and they needed to place people , " she said . "	it 's been a great experience for all of us . "	as ksu ?	and other universities across the nation ?	run into budget shortfalls , the extra help , the part-time workers , are often the first to go .	with green 2 gold , those workers are not only brought back , but there are less outstanding bursar accounts .	yet mckee is still hoping to expand placement opportunities .	a university campus can be a large bubble protecting the students from the real world .	frankfort regional medical center and the city of frankfort have both been receptive to the program thus far , but mckee said there are some logistical issues to work out .	most students do n't have cars , for example , so placement opportunities are limited to those with offices along a bus route . "	taking the program that route would increase students ' engagement in community service activities through providing a free workforce to organizations , " he said . "	it would help reclaim the title of frankfort 's university . "	he said while the program has many benefits , he never lets himself forget the most important one : helping students succeed . "	green 2 gold not only kept me at ksu , " smyth-bird said . "	it 's going to help me get out of here and get a great job . "
a u.s. education department study says the high school graduation rate nationally is the highest since 1976 , but more than a fifth of students fail to get a diploma in four years .	the study released on tuesday says that across the u.s. the dropout rate for male students was 3.8 percent .	for females , it was 2.9 percent .	the dropout rate was higher among males in every state .	the percentage gap between male and female dropouts ranged from lows of 0.2 percentage points in idaho to highs of 1.7 in connecticut and rhode island officials said the steady rise of students completing their education is a reflection of the struggling economy and a greater competition for new jobs .	the national dropout rate was about 3 percent overall , down from the year before .

utah legislators that investigated former attorney general john swallow endorsed two proposals friday that they say are needed to beef up laws on elections and evidence tampering .	the nine-member , bi-partisan group of house lawmakers unanimously recommended the bills , but the measures still need to pass through the legislative process .	a third proposal addressing the legislature 's investigative powers is still in the drafting stage .	swallow , a republican , resigned late last year .	his nearly 11 months in office were overshadowed by accusations of misconduct , including allegations that he offered to protect several businessmen in return for favors .	he repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has pledged to clear his name as a private citizen .	house lawmakers say they want to prevent a similar situation . "	i find it extremely egregious that we have to go to these lengths because of what has happened in this particular instance , " said rep. brad dee , r-ogden .	the legislature was taking steps for the public good , dee said , " to make sure that this never happens again in the state of utah . "	one proposal states that someone can be charged with witness or evidence tampering if they interfere with a legislative investigation , audit or another civil process .	it also adds evidence tampering and falsifying a government record as offenses under an existing law against any pattern of unlawful activity .	violations under that law are a felony that carries a possible prison term of one to 15 years .	the other proposal spells out the business entities and conflicts of interest that candidates are required to disclose .	rep. jim dunnigan , a taylorsville republican who chairs the investigative committee , said the panel will meet again in early march to discuss that bill and release its final report .	committee members plan to study other issues , such as moonlighting rules for state employees , after the session ends .	the panel 's investigation , which cost almost $ 4 million , wound down when swallow left office in december .	investigators working for lawmakers said swallow 's 2012 attorney general campaign obscured donations from the payday loan industry that were funneled through various groups .	they also said swallow intentionally deleted electronic records and fabricated other documents to throw off any inquiry into his dealings with businessmen .	swallow 's attorney , rod snow , denied those allegations and argued lawmakers were unfair and one-sided in their investigation .	republican lt. gov. spencer cox , whose office oversees elections , has presented lawmakers with findings from a separate investigation his office made into swallow 's 2012 campaign disclosures .	cox 's office said swallow deliberately withheld information about business interests and tens of thousands of dollars in income from his campaign documents last year .	he also tried to influence a probe into the matter by altering witness statements and apparently destroying documents , the office said .	cox declined to pursue penalties because swallow had already announced his resignation .	swallow and snow denied the allegations in the report .	in addition to the probes by the utah house and the lieutenant governor 's office , two utah county attorneys , with the assistance of the fbi , are in the middle of a criminal investigation of swallow and others .	the salt lake county district attorney 's office and the davis county attorney 's office have filed criminal charges against an associate of swallow as part of that probe .	swallow , who has not been charged with any crimes , was also the subject of two complaints at the utah state bar last year .	both were dismissed .	in september , the u.s. department of justice announced it was closing a federal bribery probe without filing charges against swallow .

for release 8-14-2011 by jules witcover tribune media services the event is fairly accurately called a cattle show , wherein the presidential hopefuls are herded into the giant hall to take turns bleating their familiar campaign pitches and then are figuratively put up for auction .	whoever wins is not guaranteed the party nomination , let alone the lion 's share of iowa 's party delegates to the next national convention , still a year off .	in a way it 's more of a slaughterhouse than a rodeo , because those candidates who have fared poorly usually suffer a severe deprivation of campaign money , either knocking them out of the race before it has barely started or promising them an early exit in the months ahead .	the political professionals who put these farces together tout them as early tests of the organizational skills and the appeal of the political horseflesh they serve up .	but in reality the iowa straw poll is more akin to a carnival sideshow , complete with barkers selling their products as their minions serve up hot dogs and other traditional american picnic fare to the faithful .	this weekend , it was entirely a republican show , with candidates lined up to trash president obama while trying to separate the sheep and the goats among themselves .	the democrats , offering no intramural challenge to their president so far this year , stayed home and saved their time and money .	over the weekend , scores and maybe hundreds of chartered buses descended on the college town of ames about an hour or so north of des moines from every corner of iowa , and no doubt from neighboring states , bringing republicans to vote in the straw poll .	some came on their own nickel , but many were trucked in courtesy of the various candidates who bought and provided tickets for the privilege of recording their preferences .	the history of the iowa straw poll offers an uncertain payoff for the money and exertions expended on the extravaganza .	governor george w. bush of texas spent and dazzled his 2000 party opposition out of the race by winning the straw poll , the subsequent iowa republican caucuses , the nomination and the white house .	on the other hand , his father , george h.w. , in 1979 won the straw poll and then the 1988 caucuses over ronald reagan with a more aggressive campaign organization .	but reagan quickly recovered in the new hampshire primary , was nominated and elected .	in the last five iowa republican straw polls , only the junior bush won and went all the way to the white house .	in 1995 , bob dole was tied by phil gramm of texas in the straw poll but won the iowa caucuses and the gop nomination before losing the election to bill clinton .	other straw poll winners in this period , pat robertson in 1987 and mitt romney in 2007 , went nowhere thereafter .	in 1999 , multimillionaire publisher steve forbes , not content with a simple outdoor tent in which to court and feed attendees , built his own temporary hall and installed air-conditioning .	for his money he finished second to bush in the straw poll and folded thereafter .	there have been , however , some certain winners every time -- the iowa republican party , which has fattened its coffers while giving a boost to all the local caterers and concessionaires who work the candidates and the straw poll crowd for all they can get .	the iowa caucuses themselves are essential in giving long-shot hopefuls with limited treasuries a chance to compete through low-cost grass-roots campaigning , before millions of dollars are required for television advertising in the more heavily populated states .	as for the iowa straw-poll extravaganza , its main function is to begin the winnowing-out process among the large field that always includes hopeless egotists who have lost touch with political reality .	aside from that , politics and the country could do without this particular sham .	you can respond to a jules witcover column by email at juleswitcover@earthlink.net .	copyright 2011 tribune media services , inc.
gov. deval patrick expressed frustration wednesday with the pace of power restoration in massachusetts , four days after a historic october snowstorm . "	people are losing their patience and so am i frankly , " patrick said . "	and the utilities are just going to have to step it up . "	the governor , who had been generally supportive of the utilities ' efforts to restore power since the storm , acknowledged that crews had been working around the clock to deal with the tremendous damage caused by the storm in areas of the state .	but he said the companies must also understand the anger being felt in communities where there are still significant outages .	the massachusetts emergency management agency said there were more than 200,000 utility customers still without power as of late afternoon on wednesday .	there were more than 500,000 outages in the immediate aftermath of the weekend storm .	also wednesday , attorney general martha coakley called for a formal investigation into the restoration efforts and how prepared the utilities were for the storm , which dumped more than a foot of snow in some areas of the state .	national grid , the state 's largest utility , said it had restored 70 percent of the outages in its service areas , but many of the remaining problems were among the most isolated and challenging to fix . "	this phase of the restoration is the most painstaking and difficult , " said marcy reed , national grid 's president , in a conference call with reporters . "	we are down to the hand-to-hand combat phase .	it could take hours of work to restore service to a relatively small number of customers . "	still , the utility remained hopeful that it would have 90 percent of the outages repaired by thursday morning and the " vast majority " by the end of the day thursday .	the utility is deploying its own crews as well as some from 13 other states and canada , reed said . "	the progress we have made is phenomenal , but i know that is of very little consolation to people without power , " she said .	mema reported that 1,761 people spent tuesday night in 74 shelters that have opened around the state , a slight drop from the previous evening .	shelters in western massachusetts reported the highest numbers as people without power or heat in their homes looked for a warm place to sleep .	public safety and utility officials repeated warnings about using generators or other types of portable heating devices inside their homes .	at least three massachusetts residents have died of carbon monoxide poisoning while attempting to heat their homes in such a way , authorities said .	patrick said that while utility companies had taken some positive steps to improve communication with customers after criticism during the massive outages caused by the remnants of hurricane irene in the summer , his administration was still hearing complaints about a lack of timely information about restoration . "	i want to acknowledge , mother nature plays a very significant role in this , and we have no control over that , " patrick told reporters following an event in framingham unrelated to the storm . "	but given the amount of preparation and the historic number of crews that the utilities have assured us are out there more than any other storm , i think everybody is expecting that we have power back up and running at this point .	and i certainly am expecting that , " he said .	national grid has posted on its website the estimated times of full restoration for each community , reed said .	coakley said she would petition the state department of public utilities to begin an investigation into the storm response as soon as all power has been restored .	the dpu already is holding public hearings to examine the utilities ' response to outages caused by irene .	a spokeswoman for the state office of energy and environmental affairs said officials had not decided whether to expand the inquiry to include the response to the snowstorm .	also wednesday , u.s. sen. scott brown said he had asked each of the state 's utilities to provide him with a plan for how they plan to reduce the number of outages and respond faster to future storms .	brown expressed support for a bill filed at the statehouse by state rep. daniel winslow , r-norfolk , that would require utilities to provide two days of rebates to customers for every one day they are without power after a storm .	the measure , originally filed after irene , has yet to receive a public hearing .

that was nice for the couple from singapore , who enjoyed some extra serenity .	but for businesses on the island , serenity causes concern .	gift shops , restaurants and grocery markets in lanai city -- nearly all of which are operated by local residents -- are in the midst of a challenging time as lanai 's two main hotels that feed the island 's economy have been closed for most of this year for renovations .	larry ellison , billionaire owner of 98 percent of lanai , can afford revenue drying up for his resorts on lanai until they reopen .	but for a lot of small businesses , it 's been financially painful .	at restaurant and bar pele 's other garden , owner barbara lucas has reluctantly trimmed her staff to five from as many as 15 .	shelves that once displayed liquor bottles are empty .	and the typical lunch crowd , which used to be 50 to 60 customers , has dwindled to about 10 . "	i 'm trying to be positive , " lucas said . "	i 'm worried . "	ellison 's management company on the island , pulama lanai , has made efforts to soften the blow for businesses .	still , some residents are critical of pulama 's decision to close the 102-room lodge at koele for construction worker lodging , given that this hotel is within walking distance of lanai city and provided local shops with important visitor income . "	i think it was one bad move to shut down both hotels at one time , " said stephen ferguson , owner of canoes lanai restaurant . "	i do n't think they realized how fragile the economy is . "	after the manele bay hotel closed in june , visitor spending plummeted 81 percent to $ 1.2 million in july from $ 6.7 million in the same month last year , according to hawaii tourism authority data .	october spending totaled $ 1.5 million , down 72 percent from $ 5.5 million a year earlier .	most of the lost spending reflects absent revenue flowing to the hotels .	but fewer tourists now visit lanai city businesses that need vacationers .	brad bunn , president of the lanai chamber of commerce , noted that even the year-ago spending figures were n't good .	spending on the island had n't rebounded in recent years following the great recession , which took hold in 2008 -- unlike the state as a whole , which has seen visitor spending set new records this year .	visitor spending on lanai totaled $ 72 million last year .	that was down from about $ 80 million in each of the prior three years and compares with a pre-recession $ 110 million in 2007 .	for the first 10 months of this year , visitor spending on lanai was $ 42 million . "	those numbers paint the picture , " bunn said .	lanai not closed there 's a perception that the island is closed .	to counter this , the chamber , representing about 60 businesses , has made efforts to attract day travelers , especially folks from maui using regular scheduled ferry service to lanai . "	we 're trying to get the word out that lanai is open , " bunn said . "	there 's more than just the resorts . "	bunn changed up his own business focus from photography and a travel agency under the two boldly go name , and created the website lost on lanai to promote events and excursions .	since the hotels closed , a few retailers in lanai city have called it quits , including a juice bar , a clothing store and a gift shop .	but not everyone 's business is suffering .	hunters are still visiting the island for wild game , including deer .	and the lack of hotel rooms has increased demand for bed-and-breakfast operators .	the 11-room hotel lanai , which is owned by ellison , also remains open .	neal rabaca , owner of rabaca 's limousine service , said he 's doing all right with customers who include day-trippers and repeat visitors who own resort homes on the island . "	i ca n't complain , " he said . "	it 's not too bad for me . "	bunn estimates that about 50 visitors are making their way to lanai daily , down from about 200 before the hotels closed .	a 75 percent drop in potential customers is hard to take , especially given that not everyone coming to the island makes it up to lanai city .	on a recent day john and laura sable , from pittsburgh , came on the ferry just to snorkel at hulopoe bay for an afternoon . "	we mainly just like the park , " said john sable , a snack food distributor .	even for day-trippers , getting to the island is more difficult .	island air , an airline owned by ellison , eliminated three of five daily round trips to lanai when the manele hotel closed .	and for the two remaining flights , a 25-minute stopover on maui was added to what had been a 30-minute direct honolulu-lanai route .	ohana by hawaiian , the sister company of hawaiian airlines , also dialed back its lanai service .	a third carrier , mokulele airlines , offers only charter flights to lanai .	shelly barfield , a lanai native who works for the county 's motor vehicle and licensing division and helps coordinate the annual trilanai triathlon , noted that people from hawaii island wanting to visit lanai have to fly past lanai to honolulu first and then back . "	that 's like a half-day of travel , " she said . "	the flights are very challenging . "	participation in the triathlon held last month dropped to about 80 this year from about 130 last year .	business stimulation one event that has been a significant shot in the arm for lanai 's economy since the hotels closed has been a recurring art , music and food festival modeled after first friday in downtown honolulu .	lanai 's version , dubbed fifth friday , happens only four times a year and involves lanai city businesses providing prizes and arranging entertainment to attract consumers largely from maui via ferry .	after the hotels closed , maui county paid to have one extra boat run for fifth friday , leaving lanai at 10 p.m. , or about three hours after the last regular ferry .	maui county also helps pay for entertainment and marketing . "	fifth friday is huge for us , " said lucas of pele 's other garden .	pulama also has tried to ease the pain for lanai city businesses .	the company , which owns most of the commercial buildings in town , has given some businesses rent discounts .	pulama also began arranging for some lanai city restaurants to provide construction workers with lunch twice a month .	the lunch program began in october after a test in september .	each friday , four of the eight restaurants in lanai city alternate to make 60 box lunches for construction workers .	pulama pays $ 12 for each of the 240 lunches , which include a drink and dessert .	lucas is grateful for the business . "	we all need the cash flow , " she said .	kurt matsumoto , pulama 's chief operating officer , said the biggest contribution the company is making is paying four seasons employees , who are the primary consumers for most lanai city businesses .	some spending by construction workers also is helping .	on one recent evening at pele 's other garden , one worker ordered 12 pizzas .	however , such business is n't typical given that pulama provides construction workers with three meals a day .	ferguson of canoes lanai restaurant said all the stimulation efforts have n't offset losses that started when half the lodge was closed last year .	he said hotel workers who left the island to work at other four seasons hotels triggered a 10 percent loss for him , while visitors represented 35 to 40 percent .	in all , sales are down 60 percent .	ron mcomber , a retiree who has lived more than four decades on lanai , said in his view ellison could easily do more to mitigate all the economic disruption .

the practice , called buying " air time , " lets state , municipal and school employees pay to add up to five years to their work history so they are eligible to retire and collect a lifetime pension .	workers already eligible for retirement can buy extra years to boost a pension by up to 25 ( percent ) .	it 's called " air time " because workers buy credit for non-existent work , in contrast to policies that let workers buy credit for military service or government jobs in a different state .	dan pellissier , a former adviser to california 's previous governor , republican arnold schwarzenegger , paid $ 75,000 in 2004 for five years of work credit .	when he turns 55 in 2015 , he will get a california pension of $ 61,536 a year -- nearly $ 13,000 more than if he had n't bought air time .	that 's $ 320,000 extra by the time he is 80 . "	they give away the store here , " says pellissier , now president of california pension reform , which is pushing to cut state retirement costs .	air time is coming under scrutiny as states try to curb retirement spending and make their pension systems resemble private-sector plans .	federal law allows air-time purchases only in government pension plans .	in california , where 34,202 people have bought air time since 2005 , democratic gov. jerry brown recently proposed barring the practice .	kentucky , new hampshire and texas stopped or restricted air-time purchases after finding they were n't charging enough for the extra years , which was costing taxpayers money .	legislatures have allowed air-time purchases as both a perk to workers and an inducement for early retirement .	some states try to make air time cost-neutral to their retirement funds by charging an upfront sum equal to a worker 's projected extra lifetime pension payments .	nine states set the price in ways that could cost taxpayers money .	michigan , indiana , montana and nevada let workers buy air time years before they retire and pay a sum based on their salary at the time .	if a worker 's salary is higher at retirement , his pension will be based on the higher salary and the state may not have charged enough to break even , says david driscoll of pension adviser buck consultants .	a montana brochure urges workers to buy air time immediately , noting that " any delay can increase the cost because of ... higher salaries . "	the new hampshire legislature barred air time in 2007 after finding it was costing the retirement system $ 25million to $ 40million .

judge orlando garcia ordered paxton to appear in a san antonio federal court next wednesday after a houston gay man was not provided an amended death certificate for his husband .	the court order comes just two days after paxton was booked on securities fraud charges .	the hearing is to determine whether paxton and kirk cole , interim commissioner of the texas department of state health services , should be held in contempt after potentially disobeying a july 7 court order barring the state from enforcing any laws " that prohibit or fail to recognize same-sex marriage , " according to the court order .	garcia further ordered that state officials must provide an amended death certificate to john stone-hoskins of conroe , who had filed court papers earlier wednesday asking the judge to force texas officials to place his name on the certificate for his husband , james stone-hoskins , who died in january .	the two were married last year in new mexico .	he had argued that the u.s. supreme court 's landmark decision on gay marriage in june means his name should be placed on his spouse 's death certificate .	the ruling required all states to recognize same-sex marriages , even those performed elsewhere , and overturned any legal bans .	the certificate listed james stone-hoskins as single and referred to his husband as a " significant other .

kansas democrats are rethinking political messages for voters and pondering how to rebuild their party , turning their biggest annual convention saturday into a bit of an idea-generating session following their third consecutive disappointing election cycle .	hundreds of democratic activists and party leaders in topeka for the annual washington days convention had little to celebrate in the way of election results .	starting in 2010 , no democrat has won a statewide or congressional race and the party now holds less than a quarter of the seats in the gop-dominated legislature .	convention participants argued that republican gov. sam brownback and conservative lawmakers are unpopular .	they expressed confidence that kansas voters are receptive to democrats ' calls to support public schools and support working and middle-class families .	but many of them also said the party has to change to capture congressional and additional legislative seats in 2016 and to elect the next governor in 2018 .	they have n't settled on the best approach to rebounding , but some have concluded that criticizing brownback and his fellow conservatives is n't enough . "	we need to come up with a positive message , " said anne pritchett , an overland park teacher elected saturday as co-chairwoman of the party 's progressive caucus . "	i 'm tired of talking about brownback . "	the washington days convention is a friday night and saturday of receptions , speeches , workshops and party meetings .	the keynote speaker for the saturday night banquet ?	an event that in 2006 drew then-rising party star , now president barack obama ?	was former maryland gov. martin o'malley , a potential presidential candidate in 2016 .	the biggest piece of official business was electing a new party leader for the next two years , with state chairwoman joan wagnon stepping down after four years .	the state committee picked larry meeker , of lake quivira in the kansas city area , a former vice president of the federal reserve bank there .	several top democrats saw republicans ' success in linking democrats in kansas to obama as a key factor in the minority party 's woes .	and o'malley told reporters before his speech , " we failed nationally to tell the affirmative , positive economic story about how we can make our economy work for all of us again . "	while meeker was the only declared candidate for the party 's chairmanship , phil black , the saline county chairman , nominated former state treasurer dennis mckinney of greensburg .	mckinney declined to be considered but said democratic leaders must see attracting votes from all parts of the state as important .	meeker said he believes kansas democrats are on the verge of unprecedented election gains because of budget problems kansas faces after gop lawmakers aggressively cut income taxes at brownback 's urging in 2012 and 2013 to stimulate the economy .	but he said the party also needs a " focused " message speaking to varied constituencies across the state . "	the lead-in line for a conversation of about republican issues is very simple : ' we 're for smaller government , lower taxes , ' " meeker said . "	what 's the simple line that 's the lead-in conversation for democratic issues ? "	brownback spokeswoman eileen hawley said saturday that the governor believes voters know his policies have created private-sector jobs , increased employment and lowered taxes to " empower every kansan to achieve a brighter future . "	democrats at the topeka convention also said their party needs to concentrate more on building local and regional party organizations and winning local offices , so that democrats build up credibility with voters in even gop-leaning areas .	democrats traditionally lag republicans in the percentage of registered voters , but the gap grew wider in 2014 , compared with 2010 .	while democrats ' numbers dropped by 33,000 , to 427,000 , the gop number grew by 11,000 , to nearly 778,000 of the 1.7 million registered voters .	clay barker , executive director of the kansas republican party , said democrats are smart to look at building voter registration numbers and local party groups , though it may not pay immediate dividends . "	it 's easier to say than to do , " barker said . "	people love to have their opinions and they 'll post on facebook , but it 's actually a little bit harder to get them to do something . "

chicago mayor rahm emanuel , who 's been trying to address big issues like education and the city 's finances , is fixing a much smaller problem ?	but a pesky one that 's dogged him for weeks ?	by paring down the size of the security detail for a powerful alderman .	emanuel , as recently as a few days ago , said the four officers assigned to alderman ed burke would not " trump or supersede " things like crime and the financial mess he inherited when he took office in may and that the detail of city police officers would be dealt with at an " appropriate time . "	apparently , that time has come .	the police department on friday announced that the number of officers for burke , the chairman of the city council 's finance committee , was to be " reduced . "	not only that , but the department said , the days of city-funded security for the cook county state 's attorney and the ceo of the chicago housing authority are over , too .	emanuel 's own security detail has already been pared down , and the police superintendent 's will be soon , according to the police department .	police superintendent garry mccarthy said in a statement that most of the officers would go back to street duty , and that the moves would save taxpayers about $ 650,000 .	the department has declined to say how many police bodyguards will remain assigned to burke .	at a news conference wednesday , emanuel was clearly tired of questions about the detail for burke . "	i 've never seen four officers for one alderman get more attention , " said emanuel , who told reporters he 'd talked to mccarthy about the issue and the superintendent was working on it .	but emanuel , who came to office with the department down more than 1,000 sworn officers , said he realizes the message that having four officers for one alderman sends .	emanuel said a more important issue is the reassignment of hundreds of police officers from clerical and other work to street duty since he was elected ?	something he called for during his campaign .	a phone message left saturday at burke 's office by the associated press was not immediately returned .	burke has had the detail since the mid-1980s , during the so-called " council wars , " a very contentious time when he and others opposed then-mayor harold washington .	in 1986 , after the police department told burke that his detail would be cut in half because the number of threats involving him had dropped dramatically , the alderman filed a lawsuit and the talk of cutting the detail from four to two went away .

florida 's top election official is recommending that the state hold special elections for congress next year , even though that may violate federal law .	secretary of state ken detzner on friday filed a proposed special election schedule that calls for holding a primary election next march and a general election in may for newly revised congressional districts .	detzner was complying with an order from circuit judge terry lewis .	lewis is mulling whether to order a special election for florida 's revised congressional map .	the legislature adopted a new map earlier this week after lewis had ruled the current districts were illegally drawn to benefit republicans .	detzner 's court filing states that after consulting with county election officials the state concluded it " not possible " to conduct the elections this year and instead officials recommended 2015 elections .	but attorneys for the state add that " such a schedule in all likelihood " violates a federal law that requires two-year terms for members of congress .	legislative leaders have said that they are adamantly opposed to holding a special election with the new map which changes the boundaries of seven of the state 's 27 congressional districts .	thomas zehnder , one of the attorneys representing the groups that sued over the congressional districts , said his clients " do not agree " with the positions taken by state election officials but did n't offer any details .	the coalition that sued the legislature plans to file a response with the court on monday .	in their past filings the league of women voters of florida and the other groups that sued over the maps have suggested using the november election as a primary and holding a general election for the congressional seats in december .	lewis will hold a hearing next week on both the new map and the proposed schedule .	voters in 2010 passed the " fair districts " amendment that says legislators can not draw up districts to favor incumbents or a political party , a practice known as " gerrymandering . "	the league and other groups contended that the gop consultants used a " shadow " process in 2012 to draw districts that benefited republicans and violated the new standards .	lewis agreed there was enough evidence to show that consultants helped manipulate the process and ruled that two districts were invalid .	the two districts flagged by lewis are a sprawling district that stretches from jacksonville to orlando and is held by u.s. rep. corinne brown , a democrat , and a central florida district held by u.s. rep. dan webster , a republican .	the new map alters those two districts somewhat , but also changes the boundaries for five other districts .	two gop held districts , for example , would become slightly more democratic , but the swing is not that significant .	republicans currently hold a 17-10 edge in the state 's congressional delegation and the new map may not change that .	follow gary fineout on twitter : http://twitter.com/fineout

the oregon legislature is taking a hard look at intervening in the state 's timber counties that are running out of money .	lawmakers are considering a variety of measures that would allow the state to take over critical government functions and impose a temporary income tax on county residents .	the issue became especially acute this week when voters in curry and josephine counties rejected property tax levies that the local sheriffs said were needed to pay for basic public safety .	legislators who back intervention say the state has a strong interest in ensuring at least a basic level of government is in place so people are safe and can exercise their right to vote . "	we 've got to protect people 's constitutional rights , " said rep. peter buckley , an ashland democrat and the chief budget writer in the house .	buckley said the state does n't have money to bail out the counties .	but a bipartisan panel of lawmakers representing some of the most drastically affected areas has been working on a handful of bills to help the counties avoid ?	or at least delay ?	becoming insolvent .	some would loosen restrictions on how counties can spend funds earmarked for certain purposes .	others would go farther .	one would allow the governor to declare ?	with the agreement of legislative leaders from both parties ?	to declare a public safety emergency , potentially triggering the merger of local governments .	with the consent of a majority of county commissioners , the governor would also be able to levy a temporary income tax increase to pay for public safety .	the money would be matched by state funds .	another bill would allow the state to take over county government functions including tax collection , elections administration and building inspection and charge a fee to cover the costs .	josephine county has the lowest tax rate in oregon , followed closely by curry .	curry county is widely considered the closest to going broke and becoming subject to a state takeover .	josephine county is not far behind .	some lawmakers from urban areas have been reluctant to use state dollars to help counties where voters have repeatedly refused to raise the state 's lowest tax rates .	but lawmakers from timber country say their counties face unique challenges .	since most of the land is owned by the federal government , it is n't taxable , they say , and the residents who do own taxable property are maxed out . "	people are desperate .	and i do n't think , when you live in another part of the state , you can possibly understand how difficult that is , " said rep. val hoyle , a eugene democrat and co-chair of the house committee studying the troubles in timber country . "	there are political and philosophical differences , but i think it 's much more complex than just , ' why do n't they just raise their own taxes ? ' "	in curry county , commissioner david itzen is not yet resigned to the idea the county will go broke in the wake of voters turning down a tax increase to pay for law enforcement .	with a margin of just 446 votes , he feels a campaign could win approval if the measure went back up on the september ballot , especially if the legislature allows the governor to take over broke counties and raise income taxes to pay for services . "	in the last few days i 've talked to folks who have just begun to understand the implications " of a state takeover , itzen said .	itzen added any revenue fix to come from efforts by the oregon delegation in congress to boost logging on the so-called o&c lands is unlikely to raise any money for three to five years .	that makes a local tax increase the only way to avoid a state takeover , he said .	commissioner cheryl walker in josephine county said officials there have been downsizing and contracting out services for 10 years , and have only a third of the employees they had when that process started .	she said she was encouraged that the defeat of the public safety levy tuesday was by a much narrower margin than last year .	walker said she would welcome a bill that would allow the state to take over for up to three years if voters refused to fund minimal services , such as the sheriff 's office . "	it might give us the time necessary , without being concerned about safety , that we could come up with permanent solutions , " she said .
hotel occupancy on oahu is back to levels seen at the peak of hawaii 's tourism industry in 2005 , while maui , kauai and the big island still have n't fully recovered from the great recession , according to a new analysis .	an analysis by hospitality advisors llc says hotel occupancy on oahu was 85 percent during the first eight months of 2013 , the same level seen in 2005 and well up from a low of 72 percent in 2009 .	the honolulu-based hospitality consulting firm says occupancy was 78 percent statewide from january through august , including 75 percent on maui , 63 percent on the big island and 71 percent on kauai .	while occupancy has returned to peak levels on oahu , the rate is 5 percentage points behind 2005 levels on maui and kauai , and 9 percentage points behind on the big island .	hotels are generally more crowded on oahu than on other islands because of the volume of tourists and flights .	oahu includes the state 's most popular tourist area in waikiki , while many flights to neighbor islands from the mainland u.s. and international markets require a stop in honolulu .	analysts say occupancy is expected to grow 2.7 percentage points statewide in 2014 , to 81.1 percent .	at the same time , average daily room rates are expected to go up 8.1 percent to $ 249 per night in 2014 .	hospitality advisors says one night in an average hotel room in 2014 will cost $ 233 on oahu , $ 295 on maui , $ 242 on kauai and $ 231 on the big island .	the analysis says hawaii tourism recovered quickly in 2013 because of pent-up demand from domestic markets and expanding international flights , but that pent-up demand " has run its course .

the man accused of killing his five young children and dumping their bodies off a rural road was being extradited thursday to his home state of south carolina to face murder charges .	timothy ray jones jr. , 32 , was loaded into an unmarked vehicle thursday morning and was leaving mississippi for south carolina ?	a trip of more than 500 miles ( 800 kilometers ) .	he had been held in mississippi since his arrest saturday at a traffic checkpoint .	jones eventually led authorities to the children 's bodies in neighboring alabama , and mississippi law enforcement officials say he confessed to killing all five of them ?	ages 8 , 7 , 6 , 2 and 1 .	he will face five murder charges in the deaths of his five children , officials in jones ' hometown of lexington , south carolina , have said .	jones jr. earned a computer engineering degree and worked at a $ 71,000-a-year job .	then , just over two years ago , he discovered his wife was putting their children to bed in their south carolina home and going to the neighbor 's house and sleeping with the neighbor 's 19-year-old son , according to divorce papers .	jones moved out with the children and seemed friendly to his new neighbors , but began to withdraw to the point where the woman who lived next door thought he and his family had moved away .	on thursday , jones wore a striped jail uniform and protective vest as he was escorted into the suv .	officials also loaded up boxes of evidence for the trip to south carolina . "	he 's in the hands of south carolina authorities at this time , " smith county sheriff charlie crumpton said . "	i feel sorry for what their next phase is . "	officials said the children were likely killed shortly after they were last seen in school and day care aug. 28 .	police did n't say how the children were killed , or where , except that it was n't in their home .	jones put each child 's body in its own trash bag and loaded them into his 2006 cadillac escalade , south carolina authorities said .	he drove hundreds of miles ( kilometers ) and crisscrossed several southeastern states for days , apparently using bleach to try to mask the smell of the decomposing bodies , authorities said .	jones stopped at an isolated hilltop in alabama and left them near an isolated road , officials said .	he then kept driving for several more hours saturday until he reached the drunk-driving checkpoint in smith county , mississippi .	an officer said he " smelled the stench of death " along with chemicals used to make methamphetamine and synthetic marijuana .	there was blood , bleach and maggots in the car .	a check of jones ' license plate showed his ex-wife had reported him and the children missing three days earlier when he failed to bring them over for visitation .	he slowly acknowledged what happened to his children , and led police to their bodies tuesday , authorities said .	only then did authorities go public with the case .	divorce records listed the five children as merah , 8 ; elias , 7 ; nahtahn , 6 ; gabriel , 2 , and elaine marie , 1 .	elaine marie was born abagail elizabeth but the parents agreed to a name change , records show .	jones graduated with a degree in computer engineering from mississippi state in 2011 .	records from his october 2013 divorce show he was working for intel at the time .	the company confirmed he was still employed there when he disappeared .	court records also showed a troubled life for jones and his children .	the divorce included allegations of adultery against jones ' wife , amber .	a therapist who saw jones during the divorce described him as " highly intelligent " and responsible , yet emotionally devastated and angry .	jones got primary custody of the children after the divorce and moved from one ramshackle mobile home to another in lexington .	at first he was friendly , waving at neighbors .	his children played outside .	but they all slowly started disappearing from view , said neighbor dorothy wood .
( ap ) ?	a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against the u.s. mine safety and health administration by the widows of two men killed in a coal mine fire .	the agency is n't liable for the men 's deaths because its mine inspectors could n't be held negligent under the law , u.s. district judge john copenhaver jr. ruled .	the lawsuit was filed in april 2010 by the widows of miners don i. bragg and ellery elvis hatfield .	the men died in a conveyer belt fire at massey energy co. 's aracoma alma no. 1 mine on jan. 19 , 2006 .	the wrongful death lawsuit accused msha of negligence in its regulation of the mine before the fire .	it argued that federal inspectors should be liable under west virginia law .	copenhaver rejected that notion despite what he termed the " undeniably tragic " circumstances . "	the court is unable to conclude that the substantive law of west virginia , as presently assembled , would impose negligence liability on a ' private individual under like circumstances ' to the msha inspectors , and hence , the united states , " he said .	msha had no immediate comment .	lawyer bruce stanley criticized the ruling in a statement issued tuesday . "	the widows have done just about all that is within their power to shed light upon and hold accountable those responsible for the mindless greed and dereliction of duty that got their husbands killed , " he said . "	and if there is no liability to the families of the dead miners in aracoma , where the government has basically flat out admitted it did not do its job , there is little likelihood that they will ever be called to account . "	msha acknowledged significant lapses by inspectors , supervisors and district mangers at the logan county mine in 2007 . "	effective oversight by supervision and management would have identified and possibly prevented many of these lapses , " msha said at the time .

defense secretary chuck hagel made a rare visit thursday to an air force nuclear missile base and the men and women who operate and safeguard the nation 's minuteman 3 missiles .	but his attempt to cheer the troops was tempered by news that launch officers at another base had been implicated in an illegal-narcotics investigation .	two officers at malmstrom air force base in montana are being investigated for allegations of drug possession , said a service spokesman in washington , lt. col. brett ashworth .	both of those being investigated are icbm launch officers with responsibility for operating intercontinental ballistic missiles .	at the wyoming nuclear missile base , meanwhile , hagel addressed officers and airmen after a series of security lapses and discipline problems that were revealed in associated press news stories in 2013 .	officials have said the service members are increasingly tired of working in what can seem like oblivion .	they win no battles , earn no combat pay and only rarely are given public credit of any kind .

"	he made no direct reference to the problems revealed in the past year but declared , " how you do the job really as important as the job itself .	we depend on your professionalism . "	a day earlier , he said he realized the icbm workforce has morale issues . "	it is lonely work , " he said . "	they do feel unappreciated many times . "	f.e. warren air force base , which is headquarters for the organization in charge of all 450 u.s. intercontinental ballistic missiles , has about 3,100 enlisted airmen and officers and saw 12 courts-martial in 2013 , compared with nine the year before , 12 in 2011 and eight in 2010 , according to air force statistics provided to the ap last week in response to a freedom of information act request .	in each of the past four years , the courts-martial rate at f.e. warren was higher than in the air force as a whole the ap documented problems that go well beyond low morale in a series of stories in 2013 , including one that disclosed that an icmb operations officer had complained of " rot " infesting his missile force .	since then the service has tried to improve nuclear operations , but problems remain , including attitude issues , leadership lapses and , far more perilously , security lapses such as troops taking naps during 24-hour shifts with the blast door of their launch control center open .	that could leave the missiles and airmen vulnerable and violates air force rules .	a rand corp. study done for the pentagon also found signs of burnout and behavioral problems such as domestic violence .	before his wyoming stop , hagel flew by helicopter to a minuteman 3 missile launch control center in nebraska .	besides nebraska , the missiles are in underground silos in wyoming , colorado , montana and north dakota .	each launch center , buried 60 feet ( 18 meters ) or deeper underground , controls 10 minuteman 3 missiles , each in its own silo .	the last pentagon chief to visit an icbm base was robert gates , who in december 2008 spent a day at minot air force base , north dakota , home of the 91st missile wing responsible for 150 minuteman 3 missiles , although he did not go down into a missile launch control center as hagel planned to do .	hans kristensen , a nuclear weapons expert at the federation of american scientists , said publicity about missteps has made the icbm force a " hot potato , " causing pentagon officials to " scratch their heads about how to manage this program .	you can not reassure the public about this when you are having these failures all the time . "	the icbm force is less than half the size it was during its cold war heyday , but the missiles remain on high alert , with pairs of officers on duty in the launch control centers 24 hours a day , seven days a week .	it 's a job that relatively few volunteer for , and the rand study last year found signs of burnout .
as he recovers from five years as a taliban prisoner in afghanistan , sgt. bowe bergdahl faces questions about whether he 's a hero or a deserter .	but those who know the u.s. soldier say his personality is too multi-faceted to be summed up so neatly in black and white .	bergdahl , who whose release from taliban hands in exchange for five guantanamo bay prisoners has caused a political furor , grew up in the mountain town of hailey , idaho , where he always seemed to be looking for something to define his life .	bergdahl was as likely to be found inside , pouring over a book at a local library , as he was to be spotted outside , riding his bicycle through the hills that border the small town .	home-schooled , bergdahl performed in a ballet .	he joined a fencing club , dabbled in foreign languages , including working his way through tomes written in russian .	it may have been that curiosity , combined with his tendency to gravitate toward disciplines like martial arts , that led him to join the military in june 2008 , recalled his former ballet teacher , sherry horton . "	i think bowe would have liked the rigor ?	that 's what he liked about ballet , " she said . "	and it was something that he really believed in , serving the country , and making sure that he was there for the side of good . "	now , even as his hometown celebrates his release , the army is contemplating pursuing an investigation that could lead to desertion or other charges against him .	the pentagon concluded in 2010 that bergdahl had walked away from his unit before he was captured by the taliban .	members of bergdahl 's unit and military officials have complained that bergdahl 's decision to leave his base unarmed put his fellow soldiers in danger and that some were killed in missions that included looking for him .	his hometown has been inundated with emails and phone calls criticizing its celebration plans .	mayor fritz haemmerle said in a statement the city believes in due process , urging outsiders not to pre-judge bergdahl .	bergdahl 's parents , bob and jani bergdahl , moved to hailey about three decades ago in search of peace and quiet , neighbors said .	his older sister , sky , was also home-schooled .	bergdahl got a job at a coffee shop , showing up looking for a job on his bicycle , said sue martin in a 2009 interview .	when she was asked why bergdahl joined the sun valley ballet school , martin said it was for the beautiful young women .	the smaller children at the school adored him as he would get on the floor and play with them during breaks , horton said . "	he had the best manners , any time someone needed something bowe would do it , " said horton , who is now the owner of divine , a wine bar in hailey .	as much as he liked being with people , he liked to " meditate , and sit in nature , and just listen to the sounds .	i 'm hoping he took that skill with him and it helped him with the time over there " in afghanistan , she said .	in 2007 , bergdahl got a job at a local gun club , which included helping shooters on the trap fields , stocking targets and cleaning racks full of rifles . "	he was good every which way you looked at it , " manager dick mandeville said in 2009 .	like bergdahl , the town of hailey is n't easily characterized .	the community prizes privacy , and that trait combined with the posh sun valley ski resort next door , has prompted dozens of celebrities to build second homes there .	but the influx of affluence has n't changed the come-as-you-are attitude and fierce loyalty of most residents .	when bergdahl was first captured in 2009 , the community largely refused to talk to the press until bergdahl 's parents gave martin , the coffee shop owner , the go-ahead .	martin became the unofficial town spokesperson for all things related to bergdahl .	she would coordinate yearly rallies and near-constant efforts to remind the nation that one of its own was still a prisoner .	this year 's rally , scheduled for june 28 , was quickly switched to a celebration after news broke that bergdahl had been freed .	both of bergdahl 's parents praised what they described as their son 's toughness and his soft-heartedness . "	i imagine you are more patient and compassionate than ever , " jani bergdahl said sunday . "	i love you , bowe . "
nebraska agriculture officials are concerned that cattle imported into the state from drought-stricken areas of texas and oklahoma could bring diseases with them , so they are encouraging ranchers to follow import rules .	state agriculture director greg ibach ( eye-baw ) said wednesday that officials have begun quarantining herds if ranchers have n't followed import rules .	the agriculture department is concerned that cattle from southern states could be infected with trichomoniasis ( trick-oh-moh-ny-uh-sis ) .	that disease can cause infertility and miscarriages in cattle .	ranchers must be able to prove the cattle they import are disease-free .	ibach says any nebraska cattle producers who are thinking about importing animals should contact the state veterinarian 's office to make sure they understand the restrictions .	more information is available on the agriculture department 's website , www.agr.ne.gov .
the same weather that drew a crowd to the lakefront recently to watch professional stunt kite flyers made it a challenge for dan newman to show off for them .	newman , a 57-year-old process engineer who lives in mount pleasant , is half of the tandem o2 .	he and mike delfar , 50 , of franklin have won five national kite-flying championships since partnering about five years ago . "	we have kind of a synergy , and when we hooked up we pretty much dominated , " said delfar , who had been semi-retired from the hobby after excelling on his own .	they were one of the featured acts at the outta sight kite flight at kennedy park , 4051 fifth ave. despite mild temperatures , the pros said swirling winds made it difficult .	they said it 'd be like a figure skater trying to skate on bumpy ice or an auto racer dealing with a track that 's constantly moving .	a nice , 5 mph wind off lake michigan is ideal in their book , but they adapted .	actually , they said , the unpredictable wisconsin gusts give them an edge on competitors from the east or west coasts .	newman got into the hobby after his daughter bought him a kite several years back .	he practices regularly after work , occasionally at north beach . "	it 's easy to learn , to get started , " newman said , " but it 's very hard to be precise . "	to get to that point , he said , kite flyers have to develop a " spidey sense . "	it 's all about feel , the partners explained . "	if you 're looking and you see the kite doing something , it 's too late , " newman said .	something about the movements set to music thrills him .	a choreographed kite performance is often called a " ballet , " although their selection of the " kill bill " movie series theme was n't meant to inspire pirouettes .	later they used a remotely controlled device they set up , newman and delfar dropped candy from the sky as kids ages 3 to 5 ran to get their share .	scott fisher , who owns the gift of wings kite shop in milwaukee and organizes the annual kenosha event , has known both men for years . "	they coordinate well together , " he said . "	it 's like a good aviation team .	they always know what the other guy is doing . "	the guys in o2 said the professionals do n't really make money at it .	mostly it ties into related businesses that competitors often have , said delfar , who manufactures kite accessories .

a deadly weekend shootout involving rival motorcycle gangs apparently began with a parking dispute and someone running over a gang member 's foot , police said tuesday .	waco police sgt. w. patrick swanton said an uninvited group appeared for sunday 's meeting of a loose confederation of biker gangs at a restaurant .	one man was injured when a vehicle rolled over his foot .	that caused a dispute that continued inside the restaurant , where fighting and then shooting began , before the melee spilled back outside , swanton said .	authorities offered few details .	it was not clear which gang was responsible for running over the biker 's foot or which gang the aggrieved biker belonged to .	when the shootout was over , nine people were dead and 18 wounded .	police have said five biker gangs from across texas had gathered in part to settle differences over turf .	jimmy graves , who described himself as an ambassador for the gang known as the bandidos , disputed that claim , saying the groups had planned to discuss laws protecting motorcycle riders and other topics such as trademarks for club logos .	but he acknowledged that differences with other groups , such as the cossacks , have been " simmering and brewing . "	another biker named johnny snyder said he was at the restaurant for a quarterly meeting to talk about legislative issues .	snyder , a long-haul trucker , declined to describe what he saw inside the restaurant , saying he was only concerned with " not getting shot . "	he is vice president of the boozefighters motorcycle club in waco , a group that snyder says does charity events and family gatherings and is not a criminal gang .	about 50 weapons were confiscated , mostly knives and firearms , and swanton said more than 100 weapons may be found once authorities are done analyzing the crime scene at the twin peaks restaurant , which is part of a national chain that features waitresses in revealing uniforms .	preliminary autopsy results showed all nine of the dead were killed by gunshots .	many were hit in the head , neck , chest or torso .	most of the men were in their 40s , but they ranged in age from 27 to 65 , according to reports released by a mclennan county justice of the peace .	police have acknowledged firing on armed bikers , but it was unclear how many of the dead were shot by gang members and how many were shot by officers .	of the injured , seven remain hospitalized .	swanton , who has been virtually the sole source of law enforcement information on the fight , described their conditions as stable .	he said the investigation is being hampered by witnesses who " are not being honest with us . "	police are concerned that the brawl will invite retaliation and more violence , swanton said . "	we would encourage them to try to be a little peaceful and let the bloodshed stop , " he said .	about 170 bikers have been charged with engaging in organized crime .	swanton said more arrests are likely .	katie rhoten , whose husband , theron rhoten , was taken into custody , said he told her by phone from jail that he and two other members of a motorcycle club called vise grip had just pulled up to the restaurant . "	they got off their bikes , and bullets were ricocheting all around them , so they ducked and ran for cover , " she said in an interview .	when her husband , a mechanic from austin , and the others went back to retrieve their motorcycles , they were detained by police . "	they were told they were being held for questioning and released , and they sat in the parking lot for three , four , five hours . "	then , she said , police " changed their mind and arrested everybody on the scene . "	officers took into custody all sorts of " nonviolent , noncriminal people .	i mean they got the bikers for christ guys in there . "	in a memo dated may 1 , the texas department of public safety cautioned about increasing violence between the bandidos and the cossacks , dallas tv station wfaa reported monday .	the department 's joint information center bulletin said the tension could stem from cossacks refusing to pay bandidos dues for operating in texas and for wearing a patch on their vest that claimed texas as their turf without the bandidos ' approval . "	traditionally , the bandidos have been the dominant motorcycle club in texas , and no other club is allowed to wear the texas bar without their consent , " the bulletin said , according to wfaa .	the bulletin said the fbi had received information that the bandidos had discussed " going to war with cossacks . " .	the bandidos " constitute a growing criminal threat , " the justice department said in a report on outlaw motorcycle gangs .	the report said the bandidos are involved in transporting and distributing cocaine and marijuana and in the production and distribution of methamphetamine .
bp ceo tony hayward expects to tell congress he is " personally devastated " by the gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger americans feel toward him and his company .	the explosion and sinking of the bp-operated deepwater horizon rig " never should have happened ?	and i am deeply sorry that they did , " he said in testimony to be delivered to a house panel thursday . "	my sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . "	a copy of hayward 's testimony was obtained wednesday by the associated press . "	to be sure , neither i nor the company is perfect , " hayward said . "	but we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities . "	he said the british-based company has spent nearly $ 1.5 billion since the april 20 explosion , and wo n't stop until the job is done .	hayward will appear before the house energy and commerce committee 's oversight and investigations subcommittee , which is investigating the explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed a flood of oil that has yet to be stemmed .	he called it " a complex accident , caused by an unprecedented combination of failures . "	hayward has been a juicy target for lawmakers and other critics ?	once saying " i 'd like my life back . "	before that happens , he 'll have to survive a hearing that some are describing as a public execution . "	i expect him to be sliced and diced , " said rep. bart stupak , d-mich. , chairman of the subcommittee .	here 's advice from a washington lawyer , stan brand , who specializes in criminal law and congress : " put on your asbestos suit and get ready . "	thursday will be hayward 's inaugural appearance since the largest oil spill in u.s. history .	at earlier hearings , company executives such as bp america president lamar mckay testified alongside other witnesses .	this week , hayward flies solo .	he might as well show up with a big x on his forehead . "	there 's nobody else in front of the firing squad , " brand said . "	it 's about as far from a legally recognizable proceeding as you 're going to see .	it will be a much more dramatic public execution " than the earlier congressional hearings .	another lawmaker , rep. john dingell , a michigan democrat and former committee chairman , also predicted a rough road for hayward on capitol hill . "	he 's going to have , if i 'm any judge of the committee and the temperament of the members , a very unpleasant afternoon , " dingell said .	hayward has said he 's got thick enough skin to handle the verbal assaults . "	i 'm so far unscathed , " he told analysts in a recent conference call , referring to the general criticism he 's received . "	no one has actually physically harmed me .	they 've thrown some words at me .	but i 'm a brit , so sticks and stones can hurt your bones but words never break them , or whatever the expression is . "	charles tiefer , a professor of legislative studies at the university of baltimore law school and former house general counsel , said witnesses in hayward 's situation often will have practice sessions in front of " murder boards , " in which experts in crisis management and public relations throw the most hostile questions they can . "	there 's no substitute for getting worked over by your own side for preparing you for a fierce reception , " tiefer said .	the bp ceo follows a long list of corporate faces used as congressional punching bags .	just this year , executives from goldman sachs spent nine hours trying to fend off accusations from senators that they bilked investors , and toyota president akio toyoda personally and repeatedly apologized for deadly defects in his company 's cars , only to have angry lawmakers forcefully respond that was hardly sufficient .

"	one area of contention is whether rose asked for severance pay in order to resign or in exchange for his alleged recordings of city officials .	diamondhead maintains rose contradicted himself .	although rose stated during an aug. 8 cross examination that " it would n't be right " to propose such a transaction , diamondhead attorney sean tindell included a transcript from an april 22 phone conversation with rose in which the former city manager requested benefits to step down . "	here 's what i 'd like , the same thing i had at d'iberville : nine months .	they hire somebody else , they just pay me .	they pay me nine months , pay my insurance for nine months , from may 1 or whatever , and pay my insurance , benefits , my accumulated sick leave , comp time , and all that -- well , there wo n't be any comp time obviously .	sick leave , vacation .	just like they did at d'iberville , " rose told tindell , according to a transcript provided in the appeal . "	and i 'll never show up , and i 'll never say a word . "	tindell said in the appeal : " ( rose 's ) testimony before the alj can not be blamed on lack of memory or mistake .	it is simply false testimony provided under oath . "	rose 's attorney , james halliday , said last week his client was vindicated by nyberg 's decision .	halliday also said the unemployment benefits was an important victory for rose , who has been unable to find full-time employment since june with the exception of being a part-time consultant for lumberton while the city ironed out its budget .	rose was suspended with pay april 23 and fired in june after a city council special hearing in which he did not attend .	the city 's allegations against rose included bad management , excessive absences from city hall and overall ineffectiveness .

essie mae washington-williams , the mixed-race daughter of one-time segregationist sen. strom thurmond who kept her parentage secret for more than 70 years to avoid damaging his political career , died monday .	she was 87 .	vann dozier of leevy 's funeral home in columbia said washington-williams died sunday .	a cause of death was not given .	washington-williams was the daughter of thurmond and his family 's black maid .	the identity of her famous father was rumored for decades in political circles and the black community .	but not until after thurmond 's death in 2003 at age 100 did washington-williams come forward and say her father was the white man who ran for president on a segregationist platform and served in the u.s. senate for more than 47 years . "	i am essie mae washington-williams , and at last i am completely free , " washington-williams said at a news conference revealing her secret .	she was born in 1925 after thurmond , then 22 , had an affair with a 16-year-old black maid who worked in his family 's home in edgefield , south carolina .	she spent years as a school teacher in los angeles , keeping in touch with her famous father .	while thurmond never publicly acknowledged his daughter , his family acknowledged her claim after she came forward .	she later said thurmond 's widow , nancy , was " a very wonderful person , " and called strom thurmond jr. " very caring , and interested in what 's going on with me . "	several members of thurmond 's family did n't respond to messages seeking comment monday .	washington-williams was raised by mary and john washington in pennsylvania .	her world changed when she was 13 when mary washington 's sister , carrie butler , told essie mae that she was her mother .	washington-williams met thurmond for the first time a few years later in a law office in thurmond 's hometown of edgefield . "	he never called my mother by her name .	he did n't verbally acknowledge that i was his child , " washington-williams wrote in her autobiography , " dear senator : a memoir by the daughter of strom thurmond . " "	he did n't ask when i was leaving and did n't invite me to come back .	it was like an audience with an important man , a job interview , but not a reunion with a father , " she said in the book released january 2005 .	it was the first of many visits between washington-williams and her father .	he supported her , paying for her to attend then-south carolina state college at the same time thurmond was governor .	he also helped her later after she was widowed in the 1960s . "	it 's not that strom thurmond ever swore me to secrecy .	he never swore me to anything , " she wrote . "	he trusted me , and i respected him , and we loved each other in our deeply repressed ways , and that was our social contract . "	washington-williams watched from afar as thurmond ran for president as a segregationist for the dixiecrat party in 1948 , saying " all the laws of washington and all the bayonets of the army can not force the negro race into our theaters , our swimming pools , our schools , our churches , our homes . "	washington-williams recalled once asking her father about race .	thurmond defended his beliefs as part of the " culture and custom of the south , " she wrote . "	i certainly never did like the idea that he was a segregationist , but there was nothing i could do about it , " washington-williams said in 2003 . "	that was his life . "	thurmond later softened his political stance and renounced racism .	but he never publicly acknowledged his oldest daughter or the active role he played in her life .	thurmond and his first wife , jean , were married in 1947 ; she died in 1960 .	they had no children .	he had four children with his second wife , the former nancy moore , whom he married in 1968 .	paul thurmond , a south carolina state senator and son of strom thurmond , said in an email to the associated press , " i was sorry to hear of the passing of ms. washington-williams .	she was kind and gracious and i have the greatest respect for her , her life and her legacy . "	washington-williams was left unsettled by her father 's death .	at her daughter 's encouragement she decided to make her story public . "	in a way , my life began at 78 , at least my life as who i really was , " washington-williams wrote . "	i may have called it ' closure , ' but it was much more like an opening , a very grand opening . "

what does it take to be admitted to the university of washington ?	if philip ballinger could boil it down to one word , it would be this : or try a fishing metaphor .	the uw 's director of admissions , a consummate alaska outdoorsman , describes the best applicants as salmon , swimming upstream tirelessly against the current to meet their goals . "	going with the flow is not sufficient , " he said . "	being a fish heading downstream just wo n't do it . "	these are tough times for college admissions directors .	the cost of tuition has skyrocketed .	popular articles question the value of a four-year degree .	the state 's flagship university has made room for more international students , attracting top scholars and millions in extra tuition dollars ?	but sometimes raising the ire of local families when their children do n't get in .	starting in december , ballinger and his staff of 42 will begin sorting through an estimated 26,000 college admission applications , the majority of them from out-of-state , with perhaps as many as 6,000 coming from outside the country .	a veteran of nearly 25 years of college admissions , ballinger has gained a reputation as a thoughtful , scholarly director who has shaped and strengthened the diversity of the student body .	fishing metaphors come naturally for ballinger , 55 , who was born in france and grew up fly-fishing in alaska .	his background also includes six years in the catholic clergy , four of them as a priest , and there is still something of a priest about his manner ?	genial and gently self-deprecating .	ballinger read 2,135 college applications last year , but says he 's not the most prolific reader ; that honor belongs to assistant director robin hennes , who read more than 5,000 .	they both consider the job a " privileged glimpse " into the lives of young people ?	one that makes them hopeful about the future . "	you have these students who must be a new species ?	they 're astoundingly accomplished , and you ca n't understand how that 's possible for a human being , " he said .	thoughtful , nuanced ballinger has gained a national reputation among college admissions officers for his depth of knowledge and understanding of the issues .	he 's " a scholar and a professional , " said david hawkins , director of public policy and research for the national association of college admission counseling ( nacac ) , a 13,000-member organization of college admissions professionals . "	he is an eminently reasonable person , " said hawkins . "	he really tries hard to understand as many approaches as he possibly can .	those two things together make him a rarity , in some ways . "	earlier this year , ballinger was named by the nacac to head a commission studying international student recruitment .	the chronicle of higher education , a national newspaper that covers higher education , described him as " widely regarded as one of his profession 's most thoughtful members . "	the uw 's ed taylor , vice provost and dean of undergraduate academic affairs , has worked closely with ballinger in seattle and also fished with him in alaska .	fly-fishing , said taylor , is a good metaphor for who ballinger is . "	there is an art and nuance to fly-fishing , " he said . "	there is a precision that is required in fly-fishing and a depth of understanding , that understanding of the nature of a river , of what goes on underneath the surface of a river . "	those qualities also describe ballinger 's skills as an admissions director , taylor said .	ballinger led the school 's transition from an admission system that selected students based solely on sat and gpa scores to a more holistic system that was introduced in 2005 .	the new approach gives special weight to the difficulty of classes a student takes and the context of their educational environment .	it 's a system that aims to admit students whose diverse backgrounds together offer what ballinger calls a richness of experience ? "	an entering freshman class where being a member of the class is an education in itself . "	even with the holistic review process , the class 's academic profile has risen ?	the average gpa for an incoming freshman last year was 3.75 ; in 2005 , it was 3.69 .	the number of underrepresented minorities in the freshman class has grown from about 8 percent a decade ago to nearly 12 percent last year .	that 's a good measure of its success , he said .	calls from parents but every spring , there are disappointments .	ballinger 's least-favorite job is answering the calls of parents whose children did not get into the uw , and who are crushed by the experience .	answering those calls is " tough ?	it should be , " he said . "	it 's someone 's child , who 's been wearing a husky sweatshirt since they were 2 , and going to football games , and this is their place .	and they do n't get admitted .	and they 're pretty good students .	and that hurts , it hurts . "	the uw came under fire more than a year ago when state cutbacks caused it to reduce the size of the in-state freshman class .	as a way to raise revenue , the uw increased the number of nonresident students , who pay more than twice the tuition rate .	angry parents whose children did n't get in blamed the university for giving seats away to nonresidents . "	it 's exactly wrong .	it 's perfectly wrong , " ballinger said .	if the uw did n't increase the number of nonresident students , who in effect subsidize in-state students , " we could n't bring in as many resident kids , " he said .	that said , the state legislature passed a law in 2011 that required the uw to enroll a minimum of 4,000 in-state freshmen every year .	taylor said his fly-fishing trip to alaska revealed a side to ballinger that few get to see ?	the confident outdoorsman who is comfortable fishing in the wild .	there are n't many people he would trust to lead him on a fly-fishing trip in grizzly country , taylor said .	ballinger is one of them .

hawaii lawmakers are considering whether it makes sense to get out of some requirements of the federal affordable care act so that they can make substantial changes to the state 's troubled health insurance exchange .	states like hawaii that run their own exchanges can apply for a so-called innovation waiver if they meet certain criteria .	one idea that 's been floated is for hawaii to drop the employer side of its exchange , because thanks to the state 's prepaid health care act , hawaii already has a strong law requiring employers to subsidize health insurance for many workers . "	we have to determine exactly what we want to do with our state based exchange , " said rep. della au bellati , chairwoman of the house health committee , in an interview . "	if we want to replace it , what is it going to look like ?	those are all still open questions . "	a state audit released thursday detailed myriad problems with the way contracts were awarded and money was spent at the hawaii health connector after the exchange was granted $ 204 million in federal funds .	in addition to federal dollars , the exchange was granted $ 1.5 million by the legislature last year to fund its operations .	officials have said they would likely need about $ 20 million from the legislature over the next few years before reaching sustainability , so some lawmakers have suggested doing away with the exchange .	the legislature established a task force last year to consider alternatives , such as letting the federal government step in to run the connector .	but many experts say a federal takeover is too risky , because it could jeopardize the prepaid health care act .	on a federally-run exchange , employers could potentially buy health insurance plans that offer fewer benefits than what 's required by hawaii state law , said rep. angus mckelvey .	more than a dozen state officials and business executives are on the state innovation waiver task force which began meeting in september .	the federal government has made it clear that it will not grant waivers before 2017 , despite the state 's requests for an earlier date .	the task force 's first report to the legislature set out broad goals of examining different options , but did n't include details about what would happen under different scenarios .	the report recommended that the legislature provide more than $ 1 million to the task force for personnel , consultants and neighbor island travel .	the group also said that it 's possible that it might not finish its work by 2017 , because the legislature and governor need to reach agreement on the proposed direction of the waiver , and there are long periods of time required for steps like public input .	house lawmakers briefly discussed the bill about the task force ?	hb 576 ?	friday , but deferred action to a future meeting of the health committee .	bellati said the legislature will be weighing in on the direction of the hawaii health connector throughout the session , and focusing on how to harmonize the benefits of hawaii 's strong state law with the federal affordable care act . "	we know that there are serious concerns , " bellati said .

a grand jury on thursday indicted the president of a cobb county electric utility on charges of racketeering , making false statements and the theft of millions of dollars from customers , prosecutors said .	cobb emc president dwight brown denied taking any money illegally , said his defense attorney , craig gillen .	it was not immediately clear when brown would have to appear in court to answer the 31 criminal counts in the indictment . "	the simple truth is not a single dollar went to dwight brown that was not lawful and was not authorized by the board of directors , " gillen said .	the indictment brought to a head a long-running investigation into the marietta-based electric utility .	cobb emc became tangled in a legal battle over its relationship with the for-profit cobb energy , which was mostly owned and controlled by insiders from the electric cooperative .	brown led both companies for a time , and customers had accused utility leaders of taking money belonging to the co-op . "	we still have an open case , and there are still individuals who we will look at , " cobb district attorney pat head told reporters .	officials at cobb emc would not discuss whether brown will continue to lead an electric utility that serves roughly 192,000 members in the north atlanta suburbs .	the utility 's legal trouble began when the atlanta journal-constitution reported that the for-profit cobb energy effectively ran the nonprofit cooperative and charged fees for work that the utility previously did itself .	that arrangement prompted a lawsuit against the utility , which was settled in late 2008 .	the following year , local and state authorities conducting an investigation searched the utility 's offices and the homes of its ceo and board members .
state environmental officials have agreed not to fine a southwestern indiana city for its periodic sewage overflows while city crews work to upgrade the community 's aging sewers .	oakland city mayor alfred cooper tells the princeton daily clarion that the state and city have agreed to a grace period waiving such fines until crews complete work on sewer , wastewater and water projects that will get under way in april .	but after those construction projects end , cooper says the indiana department of environmental management will impose fines of $ 500 each for any overflow from oakland city 's sewers .	cooper says the city about 20 miles north of evansville could still face fines during construction if it fails to report overflows that occur during that time .
a state lawmaker says he wants to block more state money from going to keep transit buses moving through the construction zone for the alaskan way viaduct tunnel replacement .	the $ 3.1 billion project has been plagued by delays since the bertha , the tunnel boring machine , broke down in late 2013 .	rep. ed orcutt , a republican from kalama , says $ 17 million in transit aid earmarked to help seattle during the tunnel construction should be killed .	orcutt says the city or the tunnel contractor should foot the bill . "	the project is taking longer than it should have .	should that cost be borne on the state taxpayers ' dime ? "	he said . "	or should it be borne by the city of seattle or by the contractors ? "	if the money is cut off , service could be at risk for 150 bus runs a day through the western side of seattle .	since 2010 , state aid has enabled king county metro transit to add 150 runs per weekday in the area .	authorities say the state has so far forwarded $ 36.5 million toward extra seattle buses . "	we promised we would do transit mitigation , as long as the project was under way , " said house transportation committee chairwoman judy clibborn , d-mercer island .	state transportation secretary lynn peterson extended funding last year when it would have run out , but metro says the money lasts only until july 1 of this year .	clibborn says she supports an additional $ 17 million , which would last through mid-2017 .

the foot-tall chunk of marble sitting in a state administrative office once was part of the minnesota capitol 's ornamental scrollwork , one small detail on architect cass gilbert 's century-old jewel .	now , it 's mainly a reminder of this aging building 's many deferred needs .	time has eroded the marble 's fine detail to the point that it 's barely visible .	it was plucked off the building by hand during a recent inspection of the capitol exterior , and conservators say it 's just a small example of $ 241 million in urgently needed restoration work that will only grow more expensive with time . "	they 're big projects , they 're scary projects , they 're inconvenient projects , " said david hart , a utah-based consultant to the minnesota state capitol preservation commission . "	but they 're projects that have to happen .	it 's time . "	the spending would address a lack of fresh air circulation , outdated plumbing and tangled electrical wiring so systematic that only a major overhaul will do , the commission says .	the building 's sprinkler system and emergency stair exits need updating .	and the commission wants to improve public access to legislative offices and create more flexible meeting spaces .	the money wo n't come easily .	gov. mark dayton did n't include any funds in his proposed bonding bill .	minnesota 's budget situation is precarious , and other construction projects with more vocal supporters are vying for attention ?	like the minnesota vikings ' bid for a new stadium .	senate majority leader david senjem , r-rochester , said the capitol 's exterior needs repairing .	some of the other items do n't appear as necessary , he said . "	it would be nice to have a larger meeting room , but at what price ? "	senjem said .	rep. dean urdahl , a grove city republican who sits on the commission , is aware of the tough road ahead .	he wants to spread the renovation over two or three bonding bills , and is hoping for bipartisan support . "	we 're going to put significant money into this project , this year , " urdahl said .	later , he added : " it 's a question of if we do n't do something , will we ever be able to catch up ? "	many states addressed expensive capitol restorations during the 1980s and 1990s , according to the national conference of state legislatures .	minnesota is one of a handful that has relied on piecemeal fixes .	in colorado , a balcony once open to visitors was closed off to protect them from parts breaking off the capitol 's cast-iron dome .	oklahoma 's statehouse saw large barricades sealing off the public from cascading chunks of limestone and mortar .	oregon put off changes to make its building less vulnerable to earthquakes , though experts believe a severe one could kill people inside .	much of the exterior of minnesota 's capitol is headed in the same crumbling direction of that marble chunk , according to the minnesota state capitol preservation commission .	the structure , which features the second-largest stone dome in the world after st. peter 's basilica in the vatican city , was erected in 1905 at the hand of architect cass gilbert .	he also designed the united states supreme court building .	today , it 's one of only a few state capitol buildings of its age that 's yet to undergo a large-scale renovation .	some say the need merits the $ 241 million price tag , even during a lean time .	the issue is coming to a head this year after a decade of planning and a century of small-scale quick fixes .	if approved , the project is slated to start this year and could take five years to complete .	according to the commission , the building has reached a " tipping point " at which certain upgrades changes must be made in one to two years or the building will be beyond preservation and instead demand constant upkeep or complete replacement .	this would mean a loss of cultural and historic value unseen in other states , said greg donofrio , an assistant professor of architecture at the university of minnesota . "	the prominence and significance of cass gilbert as an architect is really pretty difficult to over-emphasize , " donofrio said . "	we have one of the first major works of a master architect right downtown in st. paul . "	less comprehensive capitol overhaul initiatives in the last decade were never fully implemented , and often did n't reach consensus due to clashes over money and priorities .	the necessary electrical , plumbing and mechanical updates reach a combined cost of about $ 43.1 million , said wayne waslaski , a director with the department of administration who 's working with the commission .	he said they would be cheaper and last longer when done alongside interior efficiency renovations .	the exterior stone restoration would cost $ 17.6 million . "	when you 're making those major system changes , you 're going to impact every room in the building , " waslaski said .	he added that historic lighting and paint work restoration in public spaces is needed , but could be done later .	but senjem said funding the project in a $ 241 million lump is " inconceivable . "	he said urdahl 's plan of funding over time might work , but that future legislatures ca n't be committed to the project .	though the building contains health and safety risks , much of the restoration initiative will rely on public support for what many inside the capitol refer to as " the people 's house . "	rich polk of eagan only came to the building once years ago , but recently returned while on a visit to st. paul ?	one of the 120,000 people who annually tour the statehouse . "	it 'd be a shame if we as a state ca n't maintain our capitol , " polk said . "	they 'll do something .	they ca n't just knock this down . "
vicksburg 's public transportation board is reviewing a proposal from the police department for penalizing companies offering vehicles for hire for violations of the local cab ordinance .	the vicksburg post reports ( http://bit.ly/1821sf6 ) that the transportation board got a first look at the proposal this week and will review it again june 11 . "	this came about because the ( police department 's ) traffic division was having problems enforcing the ordinance , " board member rita wyatt said . "	they wanted something with more teeth in it . "	police chief walter armstrong said the proposal would provide that hired vehicles stopped by police for infractions would receive points based on the type of violation .	after a certain number is received , the police department would recommend a penalty to the board that could go from a reprimand to permit revocation .	armstrong presented a list of 20 potential infractions ranging from failing to keep the vehicles clean to speeding and operating the vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol .	the penalty would apply only to the hire company , not the driver , armstrong said .	drivers violating the city 's traffic laws or the portions of the ordinance that apply to them would be punished separately , he said . "	we want to make sure that the people who ride in those cabs will be in a safe , clean vehicle , " he said .

michael zahs is 66 and lives in rural washington county , down a dirt road , in a big farmhouse filled with artifacts .	he has a long , 40-year-old gray beard and often tells people he was born 100 years too late .	the retired history teacher is enamored with the past , so in 1981 he was delighted to find a stack of old motion picture films among a local estate 's treasures .	for more than 30 years , zahs kept them in his farm shed .	he knew the cellulose nitrate-based films were precious .	some dated back to before the turn of the last century .	he even had the american film institute make copies of a few of the films back in the 1980s .	he would show them during a bus tour of iowa history that he still leads every year .	no one else seemed too interested .	until now .	the films took on a new life after an iowa arts organization learned of them and enlisted film experts to confirm the reels include the earliest films ever made , dating back to 1895 . "	the specialists are gobsmacked and excited almost beyond belief what the collection is revealing , " said christopher rossi , director of humanities iowa , which recently secured a $ 51,000 grant to preserve the films .	zahs , a 6-foot-3-inch man who wears wrangler jeans and flannel shirts , is now telling the films ' story to a wider audience of people , including a documentary film crew that was visiting his farmhouse .	the films came from the basement of the old home of frank and indiana brinton , traveling entertainers from washington , iowa .	zahs enlisted his students in washington to clear off the coal dust and rat droppings , and incorporated the films into his lessons . "	together , " zahs told the children , " we are going to see things that have n't been seen for 100 years . "	when they first watched them , he was overwhelmed and amused .	some of the silent films contained short narratives : a comedy about a man who flirted with a woman on a train before it passed through a tunnel , emerging into the light with the surprise that he had accidentally kissed the maid instead of the woman ; a western with gold prospectors and wild gunfire that clearly missed the mark , but the actor dropped dead , anyway .	from 1889 to 1915 , the brintons traveled the midwest , showing their pre-cinematic magic lantern slides , hundreds of which zahs also owns , and the earliest reels of film from the time .	frank brinton was the son of a wealthy farmer who also owned early air ships .	his wife , indiana , sat on stage during the film presentations , saying nothing , but looking " purdy , " said zahs , who years ago interviewed people who had attended the shows . "	she was the original trophy wife . "	he tries to imagine the wonder of iowans back then , seeing their first motion pictures .	during some showings of the movies , viewers were so surprised at the reality in the new technology that they fell to the floor at the footage of an oncoming train .	their impact became clear to zahs when he first began to show the films to iowans .	a man told him after one showing that he remembered the film .	zahs told him he was too young to have seen it .	but the man 's father had talked about it with such enthusiasm and clarity that decades later it was as if he had seen it . "	nothing wows us like that now , " he said .	back then , iowans flocked from farms and small towns to see the traveling shows in opera houses or church halls .	the brintons often earned more than $ 100 a night , charging 10 to 25 cents a person , packing hundreds into each show . "	they were probably the highest-paid people in the state at the time , " zahs said .	a century later , the significance of the films has emerged .	in addition to short narratives , they include clips of natural disasters of the day and zoo animals , but also films of teddy roosevelt and daily life in burma and the middle east .	the collection includes what may be the earliest-known film of the middle east , said barb petzen , director of the nonprofit middle east connections .	most photographic images of that era are staged with stoically mugged subjects in settings that conform to middle east stereotypes . "	but in a few seconds of film in a camel market , which we believe is in egypt , you have this little boy waving , smiling and laughing , " petzen said . "	it was like having history so close you could reach out and touch it . "	the footage was shot with a camera that had to be cranked by hand and often was projected for audiences the same way .	the nitrate-based film was explosive , one reason people were skittish about storing it in later decades . "	i would say that ( the collection ) is priceless , and i would be shocked to hear that it was n't unique , " said bob strauss of mediapreserve in pittsburgh , a company that is digitizing the films .	a recent study of american silent films from 1912-29 revealed that only 25 percent of the films have survived , so he suspects few from the 19th century exist .	many of the nitrate-based films have deteriorated .	of zahs ' 16 reels of 35-millimeter film , his company was able to transfer 13 to digital .	together , the short clips combine to make up an hour of footage , everything from a comedy bit of a man spraying another man with seltzer , to a drama on the civil war .	once returned from pittsburgh , the films will be stored at the university of iowa special collections , and their release will be carefully controlled . "	the brinton cache is so extraordinary , " said rick altman , emeritus professor of cinema and comparative literature at the university of iowa . "	i would n't say it 's the tomb of tutankhamun , but you open the door and you see some marvelous things . "	one of the wonderful things mike ( zahs ) has done , is he has wanted to become a frank brinton lookalike .	he has done the show himself .	i know how important it is for materials to not sit in an archive somewhere .	it 's important to give them a second life . "	as keeper of what zahs calls " the most significant collection on earth " for more than 30 years , he is now determined to share it with a wider audience .	he is working with humanities iowa and red cedar chamber music , a marion company that will reproduce musical scores for the films , to recreate a traveling show by late next year , that will visit the same venues the brintons did .	one expert told him that this project could occupy the rest of his life , but zahs said he had too much else going on .	just this year he has conducted 30 historical programs , led 12 bus trips and 11 concerts , and recently found the grave of an ancestor who was one of the first iowans and was killed by indians .	he 's convinced history is best revealed in its original setting . "	there is just so much we ignore .	most of it .	i love to show people what they do n't know in their own backyards , " he said .	or in one man 's farmyard shed .

nepal sank into political turmoil monday after lawmakers failed to agree on a new constitution , leaving the country with no legal government .	the premier called new elections , but critics said he lacked the power to do so .	security forces went on high alert and riot police patrolled the streets after several political parties called for rallies to demand the resignation of prime minister baburam bhattarai and protest his unilateral decision to call elections for november .	only a few peaceful protests were reported . "	the country has plunged into a serious crisis , " said ram sharan mahat , a senior leader of the country 's second-largest party , the nepali congress , who said that six months would not be enough time to prepare for new polling . "	this government has no legitimate grounds to continue , " he said .	the squabbling political parties in nepal 's constituent assembly had failed to agree on a new blueprint for the himalayan nation by their own deadline of midnight sunday , despite repeated extensions of the due date over the past four years .	a key sticking point was whether the country 's states should be drawn to give regional power bases to ethnic minorities .	writing the new constitution was supposed to cap an interim period aimed at solidifying details of nepal 's democracy after the country turned the page on centuries of royal rule and resolved a decade-long maoist insurgency by bringing the former combatants into the political mainstream .	bhattarai , from the party of the former maoists , said the previous constitutional assembly , elected four years ago , had failed and must be dissolved , and that he would head a caretaker government until the nov. 22 elections . "	we have no other option but to go back to the people and elect a new assembly to write the constitution , " bhattarai said in his announcement .	however , his plan immediately drew criticism from legal experts , who said any plans for new polling should be made in consultation with the country 's other political parties . "	it was politically , legally and morally incorrect of the prime minister to announce fresh elections , " said constitutional and legal expert bhimarjun acharya .	police spokesman binod singh said thousands of police officers had been deployed in the capital , katmandu , and major cities across the country to stop any violence in the coming days .	at a rally monday in katmandu , small groups of college students burnt effigies of bhattarai and demanded his resignation .	police quickly put out the flames .	separately , a group supporting the abolished monarchy also demanded the prime minister 's resignation , blaming him for the country 's political crisis .	police allowed the demonstrators to march through the center of katmandu .	on sunday , police had clashed briefly with protesters outside the constituent assembly , where political leaders from the country 's four main parties had been meeting in a last-minute attempt to agree on a new constitution before the deadline .	much of the debate was over whether to draw state boundaries in a way to boost the political power of the country 's ethnic minorities .	nepal 's minority ethnic groups and low-caste communities were overshadowed for centuries by the country 's elite .	in the past couple of years , as nepal has struggled to create a new government , those divisions have given rise to caste - and ethnic-based politicians , who insist their long-marginalized communities deserve to live in states that maximize their influence .	thousands of protesters opposed to states drawn along ethnic and caste lines tried to push through a riot police blockade .	police pushed back and a scuffle ensued , with protesters throwing stones and police responding with tear gas and batons .	three policemen and several protesters were injured .	on the other side of the assembly hall , thousands of people demonstrated in support of states based on ethnicity .	a thick police line kept the opposing groups apart .	the constituent assembly was elected to a two-year term in 2008 to draft a new constitution but has been unable to finish the task .	its tenure has been extended four times , but the supreme court rejected any further extensions .	the assembly 's formation came two years after pro-democracy protests forced nepal 's king to give up authoritarian rule and restore democracy in the country .	one of the assembly 's first decisions was to abolish the centuries-old monarchy and convert nepal into a republic .	the political parties have been able to resolve some other thorny differences in the past , including the future of thousands of maoist rebel fighters who were confined to camps after giving up their armed revolt in 2006 .	however , they have not been able to agree on the ethnic issue .

a former goldman sachs trader who earned the nickname " fabulous fab " was found liable thursday in a fraud case brought by federal regulators in response to the 2007 mortgage crisis that helped push the u.s. into recession .	a jury reached the verdict at the civil trial in manhattan federal court of fabrice tourre ?	a french-born stanford graduate described by securities and exchange commission lawyers as the face of " wall street greed . "	tourre 's attorneys portrayed him as a scapegoat in a downturn caused by larger economic forces .	tourre , 34 , found liable in six of seven sec fraud claims .	he faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry .	the exact punishment will be determined at a future proceeding .	the sec had accused tourre of misleading institutional investors about subprime mortgage securities that he knew were doomed to fail , setting the stage for a valued goldman hedge fund client , paulson & co. .	inc. , to secretly bet against the investment .	the maneuver ended up making $ 1 billion for the hedge fund and its wealthy president , john a. paulson , and millions of dollars in fees for goldman .	the sec also sought to show that it helped earn tourre a bonus that boosted his salary to $ 1.7 million in 2007 .	on the witness stand , the sec lawyers confronted tourre with a january 2007 email it said deliberately misled another institutional investor about paulson 's short position in the investment called abacus 2007-ac1 .	asked repeatedly if the information in the email was " false , " tourre responded , " it was not accurate . "	he added : " i was n't trying to confuse anybody ; it just was n't accurate at the time . "	in closing arguments , sec lawyer matthew martens called tourre 's testimony " surreal , imaginary , unreal , dreamlike " and told jurors that the defendant wanted them " to live in his imaginary land ... to live in a fantasy world . " "	only if you close your eyes to the facts , you can find mr. tourre not liable for his actions , " the sec lawyer said .	tourre 's attorney , john coffey , countered that the government had " unjustly accused him of wrongdoing . "	coffey urged jurors to put the investment 's failure in perspective , noting that all similarly packaged securities " went off the cliff as well " after 2007 .	the civil case had been called the most significant legal action related to the mortgage securities meltdown , but it lacked the drama and high stakes of white-collar criminal cases .	much of the testimony was devoted to the intricacies of synthetic collateralized debt obligations , or cdos ?	a complex type of investment central to the case .	some of the testimony focused on a personal email tourre sent to his girlfriend in france .	the sec lawyers said the missive proved the hubris of a man at the center of a massive fraud , while the defense claimed was " an old-fashioned love letter " penned by a young trader who was full of self-doubt and angst over upheaval in the financial world .	writing in french , tourre said of the financial markets : " the whole building is about to collapse anytime now . " "	only potential survivor , the fabulous fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities !!! "	pressed by marten on what he meant , tourre said , " i did n't create any monstrosities . "	goldman settled with the sec in 2010 by paying a $ 550 million fine without admitting or denying wrongdoing .	tourre left the firm in 2012 .
the way to better handwriting starts with your voice and music .	think of a sing-along : " where do you start your letters ?	at the top .	where do you start your letters ?	at the top ... " that 's what cathy van haute had every kindergarten through second-grade teacher in the campbell county school district singing during a recent clinic .	van haute is an occupational therapist from omaha , neb. , tasked with teaching teachers to make handwriting fun .	the song was a little embarrassing for many of the teachers to sing , but van haute belted out the next verse of the song anyway .	she knows something drastic must be done to help students build handwriting skills in the computer age . "	i am here to teach teachers to make handwriting fun , " van haute said . "	if it is not an automatic skill , kids will write less . "	children have progressively put fewer pencils to paper over the past 10 years as they have become more computer proficient .	that has helped create a sticky situation for many school districts , including campbell county .	children are less competent at the mechanics of handwriting , yet it is still a necessary skill required to take many standardized tests .	students know the material , but do not have the writing skills to express the concepts on a test .	students often have five sentences in their heads , but when writing is not automatic , only two of those sentences will make it to the paper . "	kids do n't write at home , " said pronghorn elementary principal steve fenton . "	what she 's giving us is some good strategies to overcome that . "	the clinic was just the start .	van haute will continue half-day sessions for all teachers in the elementary schools .	the district has allowed teachers to choose from other handwriting curriculum in the past , but found that the choice was not always producing the best results .	in the next school year , all teachers will teach the handwriting without tears system .	the program uses a variety of hands-on approaches to teach young students how to construct letters .	fenton will be responsible for the programs next year when he starts his new job as assistant superintendent of curriculum and assessment .	there has been a move away from teaching handwriting apart from reading during the past few years , a move that has proven to be detrimental to students ' ability to express themselves and their thoughts on paper . "	we have seen a trend nationally that teachers need to teach handwriting , " van haute said . "	the technology age has had so much of an impact . "	the handwriting without tears system is the opposite of technologically advanced approach .	the kits sitting in front of lakeview elementary teachers vanessa gemar and melinda leastman were filled with wooden sticks and curves and a mat that are used to teach students the shapes that are used to construct letters .	van haute even demonstrated writing practice with one of the least technologically advanced platforms available , miniature chalkboards .	within a couple of hours , van haute had won over her audience and had them riding imaginary motorcycles between writing exercises .	the sound of 50 imaginary motorcycles filled the room while van haute explained another less technologically advanced writing tool , the pencil .

nearly 50 people crowded a room monday night in the council bluffs public library for the first of four public hearings on a plan to redraw iowa 's congressional and legislative districts , but fewer than a dozen offered opinions on the plan .	the proposal would redraw iowa 's congressional districts into four rough quadrants , dumping the state 's 5th congressional district .	iowa lost a congressional seat after the 2010 census showed that its population growth was n't as strong as in other states .	the map also would combine many state-level districts , displacing about a third of the state 's 150 legislators .	the majority of those who attended monday 's hearing identified themselves as republicans who opposed the new map that would move western iowa 's conservative pottawattamie county out of the soon-to-disappear 5th congressional district , which is represented by republican rep. steve king .	the county would be moved into a newly configured 3rd congressional district , which is currently represented by democrat rep. leonard boswell .	the plan would force king and another republican , rep. tom latham , to run against each other next year for new 4th district if both chose not to move and run again for congress . "	the maps as redrawn now do n't serve pottawattamie county at all , " said jeff jorgensen , chairman of the pottawattamie county republican party . "	i think we have a very strong voice here in western iowa .	it 's a conservative voice .	it 's a republican voice . "	moreover , jorgensen said , he believes senate majority leader michael gronstal , d-council bluffs , favors the plan . "	that 's all i need to know , " jorgensen said . "	i can not support this . "	the map also would toss together two democrats , reps. bruce braley and dave loebsack , in a new northeast iowa district that include linn and dubuque counties .	loebsack has said he has represented the state 's southeast in the past and that he would move so that he could continue to do so .	but a few democrats attending the hearing voiced support of the plan . "	i admire iowa 's way of redistricting , " said cynthia keithley of council bluffs . "	it 's as fair as humanly possible . "	iowa has a unique system , implemented more than 40 years ago , for redrawing districts .	the map is prepared by the nonpartisan legislative services agency , which is prohibited by law from considering voter registration numbers or where incumbent lawmakers live .	the agency is tasked with making the districts as compact and equal in population as possible .	the legislature will vote on the new map , set to happen next week , but can not alter it .	it can only adopt or reject the plan .	if the first map is rejected , the agency has 35 days to prepare a second map , which also can not be altered .	if that map is rejected , the agency has another 35 days to prepare a third proposed map , which can be altered .	the legislature has until sept. 1 to approve a new map of legislative and congressional districts , but if they do n't , the iowa supreme court would step in to choose a map .	state leaders from both the republican-controlled house and democratic-controlled senate have hinted that the first proposal could win approval , and republican gov. terry branstad has said the nonpartisan system works in favor of approving the initial plan .	history also seems to favor relatively quick adoption of newly-drawn districts ?	a process that can drag on for months ?	even years ?	in other states .	in iowa , lawmakers approved the third plan in 1981 , the first plan in 1991 and the second plan in 2001 .	but iowa 's process wo n't please everyone , as evidenced monday by those upset at the possibility of losing king as their congressman .	that included michael patomson , who said he worried about putting pottawattamie county and polk county ?	which encompasses des moines ?	in the same congressional district . "	i 'm concerned that pottawattamie county will be losing steve king , " patomson said . "	more importantly , i 'm concerned that steve king will be losing pottawattamie county . "	the monday hearing was connected via video link over the iowa communications network to hearing rooms in mason city , sioux city and spencer , where only a smattering of people showed up .	more hearings will be held later this week in bettendorf , cedar rapids and des moines .	the redistricting advisory commission conducting the hearings will compile all of the comments and written testimony submitted to it to present to lawmakers before they vote on the redistricting plan .

cameroon 's government denied the charges , that come amid growing tensions between nigeria and its neighbors over the boko haram islamic uprising that has spilled over nigeria 's borders .	farmer mariamu abubakar said cameroonian soldiers on nov. 30 killed about 150 people in his village near nigeria 's banki border post , stole their livestock and set their huts ablaze .	he was among 643 refugees who arrived monday night at adamawa 's fufore transit center .	soldiers who screened them said they came from gamboru to banki , a 150-kilometer ( 95-mile ) stretch along nigeria 's border with cameroon .	while it is unclear who attacked whom and why , it is " a real humanitarian disaster , " said david miliband , the visiting president of the new york-based international rescue committee . "	they are unable to go home because it 's not yet safe and because they fear for their lives . "	nigeria 's petroleum minister said last week he expects a major oil discovery soon in the lake chad basin , likely to fuel more border conflicts in the northeastern part of nigeria that joins chad , cameroon and niger .	earlier tuesday , gov. bindow jibrilla of nigeria 's northeastern adamawa state accused nigeria 's neighbors of sending their nationals into his state disguised as refugees .	jibrilla told reporters he did n't know why it was happening but that there were thousands .	cameroon said its troops fighting " in synergy " with nigerian soldiers carried out a " coordinated operation " on several border villages around lake chad nov. 27 to nov. 29 .	it said they freed at least 900 people held by boko haram extremists . "	we have a highly trained military that respect human rights , " said cameroon government spokesman issa tchiroma bakary .	he denied cameroon has forcefully evicted nigerian refugees though nigerian officials have reported receiving several thousand in recent months .
the federal highway administration has forced hernando to move a sign since it is currently placed on a federal right of way on the west side of the nesbit exit north of town on interstate 55 .	public works director gary mcelhannon tells the commercial appeal ( http://bit.ly/1ukgl5i ) the ornamental metal sign and attached civic group symbols sits about 20 feet above the interstate on a steep knoll .	it has been there for at least two years .

for eight winters , retiree tom webb of parkdale has been getting up at 3 a.m. three times a week to groom the cross-country ski trails at teacup lake , a volunteer-run trail system on mount hood , through snow and sleet and drifts of night .	after he fires up the hulking , tracked machine at 5 a.m. , the job usually takes about four hours ?	but can take up to 10 , depending on how deep the snow is , how much it 's blowing and how many passes he has to make to create the parallel tracks that have drawn increasing numbers of nordic skiers to teacup for years .	while the teacup lake nordic club pays webb by the hour for the use of his machine , for the most part the money goes back into the machine and he donates his labor , he says . "	i 'm just happy to break even . "	he 's seen blizzards lit up by his overhead lights , early morning alpenglow , cougar tracks and , recently , a mountain beaver .	at the end of this season , which will probably be sometime this month despite the nearly seven feet of snow still at teacup , webb , 68 , will call it quits and turn over the keys to a replacement driver .	cross-country skiers sent a big snowy kiss his way on april 15 with a thank-you cake and celebration at the warming cabin at teacup . "	the guy has just put in so much love and time and effort , " says club president paul blackburn , who estimates that webb has groomed 10,000 kilometers for the club .	aside from waking up at 3 a.m. , the love expresses itself in little details such as fixing the machine when it breaks down with the thermometer at 5 degrees .	it also expresses itself in the thrice-weekly emails he sends members about conditions and grooming plans .	the emails are so " lively and inviting and informative , " club board member sue seyl says : " ' come on up , the snow 's great , ' or ' it 's going to be a beautiful day .	do n't miss it today , bring your friends up . ' "	webb loves watching families bring small kids ( " we even have a diaper-changing station at the cabin " ) and the color and excitement of the high school races .	webb started skiing with the portland chapter of the oregon nordic club in 1981 at a friend 's suggestion .	at the time , webb says , he was divorced , out of shape and a bit of a hermit .	after retiring as a sheet metal worker , he moved from banks to parkdale .	the grooming at teacup was less frequent then ?	the guy doing it lived in scappoose ?	so webb paid $ 12,000 for a used 1985 pisten bully , a snow cat with a 13-foot-wide blade and a nordic track setter , and took over .	he likes skiing on the tracks that he puts heart and soul into , but even more , he says : " i like driving the machine .	it 's fun for me . "	when he 's skiing , he says , he thinks like a groomer ; when he 's grooming , he thinks like a skier .	with bicycles and lawn mowers calling , trail use starts to drop off around march 1 , webb says , even though the snowpack is substantial .	it 's a contrast to this january , when webb had to put pallets over bare places in the trail and bulldoze snow over it .	even though he loved grooming , webb wants to travel and will enjoy not being so tied down in the winter . "	it 's just about like having a dairy farm , except i do n't have to milk the pisten bully . "
embarking on what he called a reluctant trade mission , ohio governor john kasich said friday that his state 's economic comeback was generating interest ?	and potential new business opportunities ?	on the world stage in switzerland .	ohio 's blue-collar voters have made it arguably the most important swing state in recent u.s. presidential elections , and president barack obama won the state in november by focusing on the controversial auto industry bailout .	kasich , who explored a presidential bid in the run-up to the 2000 election , also confirmed he would seek re-election in 2014 .	the republican governor , a former congressman who rose to house budget committee chairman before working as a lehman brothers investment banker and commentator on fox news channel , told the associated press that he was initially " very reluctant " to make the trip to the annual world economic forum in davos .	he decided to go , he said , after he realized that this week 's gathering offered a valuable chance to court business and provide a global perspective .	davos is awash with top business leaders from around the world as well as many other high-profile people from the worlds of politics , academics and commerce . "	it 's like a trade mission in one small little area , " he said . "	we focused almost exclusively on ceos . "	kasich was involved in a number of panel discussions and held private meetings with about 15 executives from big companies to pitch ideas on investing in ohio . "	the thing that i have been surprised by is that the people around have heard that things are getting better in ohio , " he said . "	i 've been shocked . "	when talking with international leaders , kasich said he emphasizes his willingness to work closely with business ?	a fact he credits for helping turn ohio 's $ 8 billion budget deficit into what he says will be a $ 1 billion surplus .	among those he held business discussions were u.s.-based dow chemical co. and philips healthcare , which announced thousands of layoffs last year and is a part of netherlands-based royal philips electronics .	his message : " we 're open for business ... .	if you 've got a big idea , come to ohio . "	kasich is expected to unveil his next state budget plan on feb. 4 .	and he anticipates that his proposal to increase taxes on oil and gas drilling will resurface . "	you can expect that to come back , " he said .	the idea was scuttled last session after heavy lobbying by the oil and gas industry and pushback from opponents of tax increases .	kasich hopes to use proceeds to fund modest income-tax relief across the state .	in the interview , kasich would n't say whether his spending blueprint would include an expansion of medicaid .	he said " political considerations are at a minimum " as he weighs the issue .	that includes potential political fallout to his gop colleagues in the state legislature who oppose president barack obama 's affordable care act .

removing asbestos from an old building can be hazardous and expensive .	so what happens if the ground outside is covered with the stuff for miles around ?	that 's what a team of unlv geologists is trying to figure out after the surprise discovery of potentially toxic , asbestos-type minerals in rocks and dust from boulder city to the southeastern edge of the las vegas valley .	university of nevada , las vegas geology professor brenda buck said this marks the first discovery of naturally occurring asbestos fibers in southern nevada .	a peer-reviewed study detailing the find was published last month in the journal of the soil science society of america .	so how worried should everyone be ? "	at this point we know enough to know there is a hazard .	we do n't know what the risk is , " buck told the las vegas review-journal ( http://bit.ly/1cuuihk ) . "	there 's a lot of work that needs to be done .	until we know more , it would be a good idea to avoid dust from those areas . "	that could be a tall order .	the study area takes in all of boulder city and a wide swath of the eldorado valley , with tendrils that reach to the shore of lake mead and into the oldest parts of henderson . "	it 's not everywhere , but i think you 're going to have a hard time not finding it , " buck said . "	in every sample we looked at we found it .	we found it pretty easily , too .	i did n't have to look very hard . "	for one test , buck spent about three hours walking her horse along a dirt road in boulder city .	when she was done , she found asbestos fibers on her pants and her shoes . "	the last thing we want to do is upset people or cause a panic .	but on the other side , we do n't want to give people assurances we ca n't give , " said unlv geologist rodney metcalf , who partnered with buck on the study . "	we ca n't in good conscience say there 's no problem . "	the long , thin minerals were forged roughly 13 million years ago in the roots of volcanoes , also known as plutons . "	boulder city sits on top of one of these plutons , " metcalf said .	the fibers have been weathering from the ground for the past 12 million years or so , giving them plenty of time to spread out , buck said .	she specializes in something called medical geology , basically the study of the health impacts of minerals .	she was in the midst of sampling arsenic in the dust blowing from nellis dunes when she came across a fibrous mineral in one of her samples .	she later started talking to metcalf about the asbestos-like fibers he was studying in northwestern arizona , and the two decided to go looking for trouble in similar rock deposits in southern nevada .	what they mostly found was a mineral called actinolite , one of six types of asbestos regulated as a toxic substance by the u.s. environmental protection agency .	buck said she notified " several people " at the epa about her discovery .	asbestos fibers ca n't be absorbed through the skin , but if inhaled or swallowed they can spawn a range of deadly diseases that might not develop for a decade or decades .	the real " pathway to humans " is in the air , metcalf said .	the fibers are too tiny to be seen with the naked eye and so light that they can stay aloft indefinitely once they 've been stirred up by the wind or the tires on a vehicle .	asbestos exposure is linked to mesothelioma , cancer of the lungs , larynx and ovaries , depressed immune function , and other disorders . "	there 's no known safe amount , " buck said . "	the good news is not everyone who is exposed gets sick . "	buck , metcalf and company plan to continue their research and expand their study area under a three-year grant from the bureau of land management .	that work will include taking a closer look at other potential trouble spots in clark county , most of it contained within the roughly 1,200 square miles of desert between u.s. highway 95 and the colorado river from boulder city to the southern tip of the state .	buck said the bureau wants to know more about where such deposits are and what kind of risks they pose . "	they 're worried about their workers , " she said .	meanwhile , researchers from the university of hawaii are in the early stages of tests to determine how carcinogenic the fibers in southern nevada might be .	they also plan to conduct a health assessment to see if any documented cases of mesothelioma , a rare cancer closely associated with asbestos , could be the result of " environmental exposure " in or around boulder city , buck said .	metcalf said asbestos is actually a loaded term , with varying definitions used by doctors , geologists and environmental regulators .	for example , he said , the fibers he has found in mohave county , ariz. , do not meet the regulatory definition of asbestos .	but that does n't mean they 're safe .	in fact , they are similar to those found in libby , mont. , where so much toxic soil was spread around by a nearby mine that the entire small town has been declared a superfund site by the environmental protection agency . "	you get this debate about is this asbestos or is it not , " metcalf said . "	it 's really not the issue .	the issue is , is it toxic . "	buck grew up in montana and has cousins who got sick and died in libby .	she said she started taking special precautions in the field after the first fibers were found around boulder city . "	as soon as i knew they were there , i sure as hell did .	i wear a mask . "	the discovery also forced her to revamp her lab at unlv to make it safer . "	the whole point is do n't let it get into the air .	you ca n't just drag it in and expose everyone to it . "	for the same reason , buck has decided not to take college students into the field with her to help collect samples as she normally would .	she does n't want to expose them to something with the potential to shorten their lives . "	they 're just so young . "
the new orleans sheriff says he signed a proposed agreement for jail improvements with the u.s. justice department in hopes of boosting public confidence in the lockup ?	even though he does n't think inmates ' federal rights are being violated . "	i think we 're doing pretty good without the consent decree , " sheriff marlin gusman said thursday during a federal court hearing on the proposed agreement .	gusman was under intense questioning by harry rosenberg , a lawyer hired by the city as it fights approval of the agreement .	while gusman runs the jail , the city funds it .	city officials have been highly critical of gusman and say court approval of the agreement , known as a consent decree , could force the city to pour millions of dollars into a badly run facility .	mayor mitch landrieu has called for the federal government to place the jail in receivership and appoint someone other than gusman , an elected official , to oversee it .	gusman 's appearance came two days after the release of jarring jailhouse videos depicting apparent drug use in a cell where one inmate opensly brandished a large handgun and a suspected escaped inmate roaming unabashedly through the french quarter .	gusman has not discussed details of the videos , believed made by inmates in 2009 , but has said they took place in a prison building that is now shut down .	he has said he would answer reporters ' questions after his testimony wraps up thursday .	rosenberg 's wide-ranging questions touched on numerous topics , including federal guilty pleas by two former jail officials on bribery charges .	gusman said he has not investigated vendors who did business with two former jail officials who pleaded guilty to bribery charges .	gusman said he is waiting to see what the continuing federal investigation reveals .	gusman defended the decision to build a state-of-the-art kitchen for a new jail building under construction with funding from the federal emergency management agency and local funds .	rosenberg noted that it could serve 25,000 meals a day for an inmate population of less than 2,500 .	gusman said the decisions were made in 2008 , when future inmate populations were difficult to determine in a city still recovering from hurricane katrina .	at times , gusman acknowledged various problems at the jail , particularly with the physical condition of the city-owned facilities and a low-paid staff that is too small .	but , when asked at one point by rosenberg whether the jail was providing a safe and secure environment even before the consent decree was signed , gusman said , " to the best of our ability that 's what we 've been doing . "	then rosenberg walked gusman through a series of allegations made in documents or by experts supporting the legal actions by inmate plaintiffs and justice officials that led to the consent decree , including statements that the jail is " dysfunctional . " "	do you agree that either you are dysfunctional or the operations of the orleans parish prison are dysfunctional ? "	rosenberg asked .

gov. mark dayton said monday that minnesota 's gambling control board should have revealed from the start that it consulted the gambling industry when compiling its projections for how much the state would raise by expanding electronic gaming to help pay for the new minnesota vikings stadium .	the amount raised so far has fallen far short of the original projections .	dayton told the associated press that he was n't aware of the input from an industry that stood to profit from the new games , until the star tribune reported it on sunday . "	i think it should have been disclosed , " dayton said . "	i think obviously in hindsight , given the serious overestimation that occurred , that those sources should have been disclosed very publicly in the very beginning and people could have exercised the caution that probably was due given those sources . "	gambling control board director tom barrett said it was never his intent to hide that the companies were consulted .	he acknowledged he showed several vendors the projections , but he said the companies did n't drive the estimates . "	they did n't create this , " barrett said . "	they were asked , do you see any problems with the methodology ?	and in defense of what was before the board and how we approached it , i still stand behind the methodology . "
a federal judge in denver who stopped a coal mine expansion because of climate concerns last year is weighing whether to also halt coal mining approved in the last decade in northwestern colorado .	during a hearing friday in denver , judge brooke jackson faulted the federal government for not publicizing expansions for two mines in the craig area in 2007 and 2009 .	he also criticized it for relying partly on studies from the 1970s and '80s .	because of the poor notice , environmentalists say they did n't learn about the changes until 2012 and legal delays prevented the case from being heard until now .	jackson stands by his previous ruling .	however , in this case he says most of the coal is already gone and stopping mining now could put some 200 miners out of work overnight .
a decision this week by the mora county commission to adopt a new ordinance that prohibits oil and natural gas development is drawing criticism .	the chairman of the mora county republican party , frank trambley , sees the ordinance as an attack on jobs and the oil and gas industry .	trambley says mora county residents are at a disadvantage without the ability to explore extraction possibilities .	but for commission chairman john olivas , it 's about protecting groundwater and establishing the county 's right to make its own decisions about development .	the ordinance states that any permits or licenses issued by the federal or state government that would allow activities that would compromise the county 's rights would be considered invalid .	olivas says he 's ready for any legal challenges that the ordinance might spur .

cheryl dunson knew she had found something special when she saw the small black notebook , covered in a plastic sleeve , inside a cardboard box of old memorabilia at the connecticut league of women voters .	recorded inside , in meticulous blue script , were the memoirs of a suffrage leader who interviewed members of the all-male connecticut general assembly more than 90 years ago on whether women should be granted the right to vote .	dunson , the league 's president , and her fellow members had no idea the book existed until she discovered it a year ago in their hamden offices when she was searching for items to help mark the state league 's 90th anniversary .	the notebook , dated july 1 , 1918 , offers a rare glimpse into the views of connecticut 's state legislators two years before the 19th amendment to the u.s. constitution was ratified , granting men and women equal voting rights . "	i think it is an incredible time capsule showing the debate regarding one of the most basic rights of our democracy and it 's a right that many women in particular take for granted today , " dunson said . "	i do n't think they have the knowledge to know what these women did , how they struggled , how they worked , how they kind of weathered the kind of personal attacks against their integrity and their intelligence , " she said . "	to me , it 's an incredibly inspiring story and i think it 's one that all women should be aware of . "	the connecticut league of women voters , which traces its own roots to a suffrage organization , is donating the book to the connecticut state archives for safekeeping .	a reception is planned wednesday at the state library in hartford .	the ringed book , which is only slightly worn , has lettered tabs that the author , who identified herself as ( mrs. r. ) gladys bragdon , used to organize the interviews .	in one entry , she describes how world war i influenced men 's thinking about allowing women to vote .	some suffrage activists compared the fight for democracy abroad to theirs back at home . "	after a long but pleasant interview , he admitted that he had seen the light since the war and wished to be recorded as favorable , though not a crusader .	formerly an anti , " bragdon wrote of one lawmaker .	in another entry , she writes : " he 's always been opposed but he 's open minded now .	try again .	by all means , be considerate because he 's fearfully busy with war orders . "	bragdon also references that some women did not support the suffrage movement . "	anti just now but may change his mind .	has rabid anti wife , " she wrote . "	poor man . "	while it appears the legislators were courteous to bragdon , many were unwilling to take a position on suffrage .	in one instance she writes : " indifferent .	will do as wife says but doubts if wife knows or cares anything about public affairs or politics . "	bragdon then writes in parenthesis , " people say his wife is afraid to say ( her ) soul 's her own . "	the interviews came at a time when suffragist activists across the country were pursuing a two-pronged approach to win the vote .	while continuing their long-running efforts to pass women 's suffrage laws state-by-state , they were also seeking support for a federal constitutional amendment that needed ratification by at least 36 states . "	i think she was trying to gauge the general assembly 's attitude toward it just in case congress approved it and the legislators of the states had to approve it , " said state archivist mark jones .	between march and august of 1920 , two years after bragdon submitted her report , the connecticut women 's suffrage association heavily lobbied state lawmakers to ratify the federal amendment but republican gov. marcus h. holcomb , who opposed women 's suffrage , refused to call a special session of the legislature , arguing the state constitution required there to be an emergency .	the state archives has numerous letters that were sent to holcomb at the time , some from across the country , either urging him to stand his ground or to call legislators in for a vote . "	this book will just add to that , " said jones , who said bragdon 's writings will be kept in an acid-free box and stored in a vault at the state archives for researchers to review . "	this little book is going to give us a richer idea of what legislators in connecticut thought about the suffrage movement . "	after the 36th state ratified the 19th amendment , holcomb reversed his decision and called a special session .	connecticut first voted to ratify the amendment on sept. 14 , 1920 and later reaffirmed its support .	jones said the turnabout came after the women 's suffrage association threatened to begin endorsing political candidates .	in 1921 , five women were elected to the connecticut house of representatives .

a special education teacher on wednesday became the latest candidate to jump into the crowded pool of republican hopefuls for minnesota governor , saying he would draw on his teaching and union experience to improve the state 's economy and education system .	rob farnsworth , of hibbing , said he intends to seek the gop endorsement to challenge democratic incumbent mark dayton next year .	farnsworth , 35 , is making his second run for political office .	in 2010 , he sought the republican endorsement to run against then-u.s. rep. jim oberstar , but chip cravaack got the nod and went on to upset oberstar in the general election .	in a news release , farnsworth likened his candidacy to that of cravaack , who lost his re-election bid last year .	cravaack belonged to a pilots union before he was elected , and farnsworth said he too would bring a strong union background to the race , having been a union member for 15 years , the duluth news tribune reported ( http://bit.ly/184dkex ) . "	i admire what chip cravaack was able to do in the 8th ( congressional ) district .	as a former union member , he was able to bring conservative union members into the republican coalition , and this propelled him to victory in 2010 , " farnsworth said in a news release .	farnsworth said he earned an undergraduate degree in history from the university of st. thomas and a master 's in special education from minnesota state , mankato .	he also noted that he has three children under age 5 . "	under the current leadership , we are going to leave them a state that provides less opportunity than the minnesota i grew up in .	we can truly reform education to teach kids what they will actually use and have them ready for life , " he said .	farnsworth said he plans to have a booth at the minnesota state fair , which opens thursday .	businessman scott honour , hennepin county commissioner jeff johnson , state sen. dave thompson and state rep. kurt zellers are among other republicans running for governor .
( ap ) ?	as briana glover sat at the disability action center , she patiently waited with a smile on her face for her name to be called .	little did she know her name would be called first to receive a brand new bicycle custom made for her .	glover , along with 11 other children with disabilities , received bicycles made for them as part of variety the children 's charity 's my bike program that launched june 13 in marion county .	the program provides bikes for children with disabilities who are unable to ride a conventional bike .	charles lavallee , chief executive officer of variety the children 's charity , said the program opens up adventures for these children . "	it provides opportunities to create possibilities , " he said .	children from marion , harrison , monongalia , preston , taylor and barbour counties gathered at the disability action center to receive an adaptive bike .	variety 's my bike program kicked off in west virginia on april 4 with 39 children receiving a customized bike .	julie sole , executive director of the disability action center , said having a launch in marion county will help children with disabilities in the county with an opportunity to ride a bike . "	the kids receiving the bikes have some type of disability , some type of barrier that has kept them from riding a traditional bicycle , " she said .	sole said the my bike program is an opportunity for children ages 5-21 who meet income guidelines and have a physical , developmental or sensory disability to receive a bike .	she said for some , having a bike of their own that they are able to ride can be therapeutic . "	for a lot of these children ages 5-21 , this may be the first time that they 're ever able to ride a bike , " sole said . "	to have the opportunity to have a bike custom fitted for them is an opportunity for these families that they 've never had . "	the bikes are custom fit for the children whether they need back , leg or head support . "	it fits each individual child 's need , " sole said . "	it lets them do what all children want to do , which is ride a bike . "	the bikes given to the children are not usually paid for by insurance and cost around $ 1,800 .	to pay for the bikes , people and companies have sponsored bikes for each child .	one family made the trip to marion county on june 13 in order for 5-year-old thomas mcenaney to get his first bike .	ruth bosdale , mcenaney 's grandmother , said the trip from barbour county was worth seeing her grandson ride a bike for the first time .	after the children were safely on their bikes , they rode around the disability action center . "	when he went around on his bike , he had the biggest smile he has ever had , " she said . "	he 's finally able to pedal a bicycle . "	bosdale said mcenaney has tried to ride a conventional bicycle but has n't been successful .	on june 13 , mcenaney succeeded for the first time . "	he would get so frustrated , " she said . "	today , absolutely no frustration .	he was successful after all that frustration .

initially , business was good .	graham picked up a few bids a year for traffic control at construction sites throughout the bay state .	but after a while , he stopped getting calls . "	i have n't done a job in massachusetts in probably more than two years , " said graham , owner of new england traffic control services , based in epsom , n.h. " the work just dried up .	it 's really unfortunate . "	graham and others with traffic control businesses say a state law passed in 2008 , meant to open traffic details to the private sector , instead allows police to maintain a long-standing monopoly on roadwork jobs .	for one , the law requires police officers to conduct traffic on all roads with speed limits of 45 mph or higher , which includes most major roadways .	secondly , the law gives cities and towns the authority to bypass the requirement to use flaggers for work done on local roads , including jobs by utility companies .	likewise , most police union contracts require officers be assigned to details in which the city or town is footing the bill , as provided by the 2008 law .	graham said another factor is the state 's prevailing wage law , which requires private flaggers to be paid more than $ 45 per hour , depending on the region of the state .	that does n't include insurance and others costs that add to the hourly wages for flagmen .	the deck is stacked in favor of police officers , he said .	former gov. deval patrick , a democrat who left office in january , led the effort to replace police officers with flagmen on road details as part of a cost-savings plan .	he was met with fierce opposition from police unions .	lawmakers eventually passed a weaker version of his legislation .	while the state department of transportation says the move saved millions of dollars a year , it still relies heavily on police details .	of nearly $ 25 million spent on traffic control for massdot work in fiscal 2014 , only $ 845,686 went to flagging companies , according to the department .	and cities including lawrence , newburyport and salem still rely exclusively on police officers , instead of private flagmen .	chip faulkner , associate director of the marblehead-based citizens for limited taxation , said the loopholes in state regulations fuel an entitlement mentality among police who use details to boost their pay . "	it 's a big perk , " he said . "	we 're the only state in the country that still uses police details this extensively .	it 's a poster child for government waste . "	faulkner said cities and towns could save money on major projects by hiring private flaggers over police officers , who get paid $ 50 an hour or more to direct traffic , depending on their union contracts and rank .	law enforcement officials defend police control at construction sites .	while costs may be higher , they argue for the added benefit of putting another cop out on the street . "	we have officers that interrupt crimes or even something as simple as giving someone directions while they 're out there , " said lawrence police chief james fitzpatrick . "	it comes down to a question of public safety . "	massdot officials said the changes have reduced the costs to taxpayers by allowing the state to pay only for the amount of time a flagman or officer is on the job .	before the law was enacted , the state was required to pay police a minimum number of hours for details . "	while spending on construction has increased , overall the cost of traffic control has decreased , " said michael verseckes , a department spokesman .	but a 2009 state audit , one year after the law was enacted , found that transportation officials " overstated " the estimated savings of the law , from $ 5.7 million to $ 7.2 million a year .	meanwhile , lawmakers are proposing rules to give police even more control over traffic details .	one bill , filed by sen. james timilty , d-walpole , would prohibit flaggers from working state highway jobs unless the highway department would save at least 20 percent from a police detail .	timilty -- who received more than $ 20,000 in contributions from state and local police unions since 2008 , according to the state office of campaign and political finance -- did n't return a message left seeking comment .	neither did the state police association of massachusetts , which represents troopers .	it referred questions about details to a public relations firm , liberty square group , which declined to comment .	in new hampshire , transportation officials rely mostly on flagmen for traffic details , even on some highways . "	we all know that people slow down more for blue lights than orange vests , but we try to balance that out as much as possible , " said bill boynton , a spokesman for the new hampshire department of transportation .	graham said the prevailing wage in new hampshire for a flagger is about $ 20 an hour , compared to about $ 50 an hour for police details . "	that 's a great wage for a flagger , " he said . "	and it 's a big savings for the state . "	flagging companies say they 've been intimidated by police officers in massachusetts and in some cases even forced off local construction sites after police unions filed grievances against cities and towns for hiring private flagmen .	fiscal watchdogs said there appears to be little appetite among state leaders to change the law . "	the police officers in massachusetts are exploiting a monopoly , " said frank conte , a policy analyst for the beacon hill institute , a conservative think tank at suffolk university in boston . "	and nobody has the political will to change it . "

education issues have been at the center of gov. ed rendell 's governing agenda since the former philadelphia mayor took office 7 ?	years ago , and that does n't appear to be changing during negotiations for what will be the final state budget of his administration .	the democratic governor was speaking to reporters shortly after a budget meeting with legislative leaders last week when the topic turned to the size of the state 's annual contribution to basic education funding . "	there 's nothing more important to the commonwealth 's future , nothing , " rendell said . "	and you know how much i 've devoted myself to education and seeing that our schools have the resources ( so ) that our kids can reach their potential , and guys , i 'm ready , i 'm ready for the 101 days if necessary . "	the leading senate republican budget negotiators emerged from the meeting at rendell 's residence warning that about $ 850 million in expected federal aid for low-income health care has not been authorized by congress , and might not be .	it 's just the sort of problem that could produce a repeat of the budget delay last year that was not resolved until october , 101 days into the fiscal year . "	if the governor wants to have a budget done close to june 30 , it would require a degree of compromise by him and the administration towards the position of the general assembly , " said senate majority leader dominic pileggi , r-delaware . "	we did n't see that flexibility in june or july or even august of last year . "	in every one of rendell 's previous budgets , basic education funding has grown from the prior year .	it was $ 6.9 billion when he took office , and has risen to about $ 11 billion in the current year .	in eight years under rendell 's republican predecessors , gov. tom ridge and gov. mark schweiker , basic education funding grew much more slowly , from $ 5.7 billion to $ 6.9 billion .	the $ 29 billion budget proposal he released in february would increase basic education funding by about $ 99.2 million , and include $ 1.6 billion in stimulus money .	even last year 's three-month budget stalemate did n't keep rendell from getting a $ 300 million increase , albeit less than the $ 418 million he had proposed .	those figures are the basic education " subsidy , " a subset of total basic education funding , so the comparable increase he is seeking for the coming year is $ 354 million .	rendell said he was determined to prevent losing ground on the gains pennsylvania students have made , as reflected in higher standardized test scores .	his aides say more money can help further reduce the number of schoolchildren two or more years behind grade level and improve the readiness of high school graduates for college or a career .	and they note that the state 's share of education funding remains below 40 percent , comparatively low among states and a continuing problem for local property tax payers who have to make up the difference .	sen. jake corman , r-centre , chairman of the appropriations committee , said his caucus " strongly supports " education funding but at a responsible and sustainable level . "	we 're not necessarily saying you should cut education or cut this or cut that , " he said friday . "	we 're saying this is what we have to spend and you have to fit within that reality . "	rendell in his february budget address ranked education as his most important commitment , and his thursday afternoon remarks to reporters indicated that his priorities have not changed a bit . "	we 're doing something really good for the future of our children and the future of our state , " he said . "	there 's no reason to stop , and i wo n't stop . "
an episcopal bishop in alabama has refused to allow priests in his diocese to bless same-sex unions for the time being despite voting in favor of such blessings at the national level .	bishop kee sloan leads the episcopal diocese of alabama , part of the larger episcopal church , and voted in favor of a new liturgy blessing same-sex unions during a national convention held by the denomination this month .	but he will not allow that blessing locally because he said the issue is too divisive for alabama . "	theology is an ongoing revelation , " sloan told the birmingham news ( http://bit.ly/odwuuy ) . "	it 's influenced by context .	there are parts of the country that are more conservative and traditional , and there are parts of the country that are more liberal .	in alabama , it would be divisive within the episcopal church .	we are deeply conflicted about this .	i 'd like for us to work through and pray about it . "	he did not permanently rule out such blessings , saying they may eventually be allowed . "	i do n't have a timetable in mind , " he said . "	i foresee that that 's a possibility . "	those who support same-sex blessings said they were surprised sloan will not allow them . "	he worked on the committee that developed the rite , " said brad lamonte , the southeast regional vice president of integrity , which promotes gay rights in the church . "	it 's bizarre that he 's not allowing it in alabama . "	others in sloan 's diocese are opposed to the recognition of same-sex couples .	for example , the rev. frank f. limehouse iii , dean of the 3,400-member cathedral church of the advent in birmingham , said on his church 's website that same-sex relationships run counter to his understanding of biblical teachings . "	we can not bless any sexual activity outside of a marriage between one man and one woman , " limehouse said . "	the bible is clear about this .	if anyone who declares the bible teaches otherwise , then i would n't doubt his or her sincerity , but i would have to question their training in biblical interpretation .

the former philadelphia city councilman -- a tough-talking democrat who made waves last year for calling new jersey gov. chris christie out on twitter -- is carefully making his way through the last days before a mayoral election widely seen as a coronation in a city where his party has a 7-to-1 voter registration edge over republicans .	in public , he acts like a candidate primed for a tough fight , with a full slate of campaign stops ahead of tuesday 's vote in the nation 's fifth-largest city .	one night last week , he was scheduled to speak at a latino event and later attend a lgbt group 's pub crawl -- a reflection of his diverse and widespread support .	but behind closed doors , the 57-year-old kenney 's " ifs " turn to " whens " as he plots out his administration and its liberal agenda -- including universal pre-kindergarten and a war on poverty .	he and his staff have been meeting regularly since his victory in the may primary . "	we have to do that somewhat under the radar screen because you do n't want to make it look like you 're assuming you 're going to be successful , " kenney said in a recent interview . "	but you ca n't really do this in two months .	it 's too many positions and too big of an organization . "	the next mayor will take over from term-limited mayor michael nutter in january a city of extremes -- booming downtown development , a downward trend in violent crime and national praise as a top tourist destination while 26.3 percent of residents live in poverty and scores of children are left unprepared by underfunded , underperforming schools .	kenney sees universal pre-k , a hallmark of fellow progressive bill de blasio 's first year as new york city 's mayor , as a prong in his attack on poverty and an investment in neighborhoods long suffering from high joblessness and crime . "	if you turn a person from a drain into a fountain by educating them properly and giving the opportunities and allowing them to blossom , you 're going to wind up with a taxpayer and not an inmate in the county prison , " kenney said .	kenney won the primary by more than 2-to-1 with the support of labor unions and a coalition of teachers , public school parents , the city 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community , and immigrant groups .	the feeling that kenney 's election is a foregone conclusion irks his republican opponent , melissa murray bailey .	independents james foster and boris kindij and social workers party candidate osborne hart are also on the ballot . "	i do n't think there 's been one article written that does n't call out that there 's no chance , " murray bailey , 36 , said . "	it does n't give anybody a reason to believe that their vote in the other direction will have any impact . "	as a city councilman , kenney successfully backed marijuana decriminalization and supported a bill authorizing added penalties for gender identity and sexual orientation hate crimes .	he has said he supported keeping philadelphia a sanctuary city for immigrants who entered the country illegally .	last winter , kenney garnered national attention for blasting christie , leader of the state across the delaware river from philadelphia , in a pair of tweets after seeing him in cowboys ' owner jerry jones ' box during an eagles home game .	the messages instantly endeared him to eagles fans . "	he 's a wonderful mix of the old philadelphia and the new philadelphia , " said randall miller , a professor at the city 's st. joseph 's university . "	it 's a rare mix that might create great expectations that kenney as mayor will never be able to realize -- that there 's going to be something for everybody and it 's all going to be good . "	murray bailey , a registered democrat until last year , is trying to reach those potential voters by going door to door and talking to community groups in neighborhoods where she says politicians have n't ventured in decades .	the business executive does n't have the fundraising or outside backing to spread her message through mass media advertising .

his campaign says bush supports accepting women and children regardless of their religion and does not exclude syrian muslims broadly , as long as the refugees can be effectively vetted .	president barack obama has rebuked what he called a " shameful " religious test in the refugee policies of some republican candidates .	both bush and ted cruz have said preference should be given to syrian christians .	bush spokesman tim miller said tuesday that bush believes the refugee policy should favor women and children as well as persecuted christian minorities , but no one should be allowed in when there is not enough information about them .	miller said bush does not believe the u.s. should eliminate support for refugees .	he said bush believes refugees are a " noble tradition in our country for decades , " but that they should not be accepted " if there 's any kind of concern " about their backgrounds or intention .	in an earlier address to business leaders during a south carolina campaign swing , bush called the struggle against the islamic state group " the war of our time .

a superbug named c-diff is on the rise , a germ that so ravages some people 's intestines that repeated tries of the strongest , most expensive antibiotic ca n't conquer their disabling diarrhea .	now a small but growing number of doctors are trying a last-ditch treatment : using good bacteria to fight off the bad by transplanting stool from a healthy person into the sick person 's colon .	yes , there 's a yuck factor .	but reports of several dozen cases in a medical journal and at a meeting of the nation 's gastroenterologists this fall suggest that with no more inconvenience than a colonoscopy , people who have suffered c-diff for months , or longer , can rapidly improve . "	this is the ultimate probiotic , " says dr. lawrence brandt of new york 's montefiore medical center , who has performed 17 of the procedures .	yet it 's much more complex : an entire bacterial neighborhood is transplanted , almost like an organ transplant minus the anti-rejection drugs , says dr. alexander khoruts of the university of minnesota .	he took a genetic fingerprint of the gut bacteria in a woman left emaciated after eight months of severe c-diff .	not only did the diarrhea disappear after a fecal transplant , but that normal bacteria mirroring her husband 's ?	the donor ?	quickly took root in her recovering intestine .	here 's the caution : fecal transplants have n't been studied in the way that science requires to prove they work ?	by comparing similar patients given either a transplant or more intense antibiotics .	history is full of failed treatments that doctors thought promising until they were put to a real test . "	there 's very good reason to think this fecal transplantation , or bacteriotherapy , might work , but it needs to be proven before everybody starts to do it , " stresses dr. lawrence schiller , a gastroenterologist with the baylor health care system in dallas .	he followed reports on the treatment at the american college of gastroenterology 's recent meeting , but has n't joined the fledgling trend .	c-diff , formally named clostridium difficile , has become a menace in the nation 's hospitals , and can spread outside of them , too .	some patients suffer just mild diarrhea , but others , especially older adults weakened by previous illness , can develop a more severe condition called colitis .	there are n't precise counts but some government estimates suggest c-diff may be responsible for as many as 15,000 deaths a year .	up to a third of patients experience a second infection , and some go on to suffer recurrent bouts .	those worst-case patients are put on increasingly strong doses of the powerful antibiotic vancomycin for weeks , even months , at a time , treatments that brandt says can cost $ 2,500 or more with each try .	but because antibiotics kill good germs as well as bad ones , the c-diff can bounce back inside a colon now depleted of the hundreds of species of bacteria that are supposed to live there . "	they 're caught in this cycle of treatment and re-treatment , " says minnesota 's khoruts , who has performed 21 fecal transplants since discovering how normal bacteria took over in his first patient in 2008 .	he 's now begun more detailed before-and-after mapping of patients to try to identify whether particular good bacteria are key .	fecal transplants are n't new ?	the first was reported in 1958 , and they 've been performed occasionally ever since .	but of 170 cases described in medical journals since then , about a third were published this year , suggesting increased interest as the c-diff problem grows , says montefiore 's brandt .	doctors who perform fecal transplants agree that more rigorous research is needed ?	without it , there 's no way to know if only the supposed successes , and not the failures are being written up .	brandt is planning a pilot study . "	i used to say this was just a measure of how desperate patients and their doctors were .	there came a time when there was nothing else to do , " says dr. christina surawicz of the university of washington 's harborview medical center , before performing her 16th procedure last week .	how are they done ?	there 's no one method .	brandt insists on a list of tests to make sure the donor does n't have diseases such as hepatitis or hiv , or intestinal parasites .	then the donor , usually a close relative , brings in a fresh stool sample that brandt liquefies and essentially drips into the patient 's colon during a routine colonoscopy .	insurance companies do n't specifically cover fecal transplants , but they do pay for colonoscopies for c-diff patients , brandt says .	the donor 's testing can run to several hundred dollars .	if insurance does not cover it , the patients pay .	one of brandt 's patients suffered recurrent bouts of c-diff for about 18 months before finding the option . "	you start to feel like a leper , quite honestly , " says ruth , a new york woman who asked that her last name not be used .	she says she 's felt great for two years since getting treated , although " i will tell you i have not taken another antibiotic . "	eds : this story also was sent previously .
what should britain do with the more than 900 people arrested since saturday for rioting ?	one lawmaker suggests putting them all in wembley stadium .	peter tapsell says prime minister david cameron should take a page from the u.s. response to anti-vietnam protests in the 1970s .	the veteran conservative party lawmaker says he recalls that law enforcement in washington d.c. , rounded up demonstrators and imprisoned them in a sports stadium .	tapsell asked cameron if wembley stadium , the country 's showpiece soccer arena , could be used .	cameron nixed the idea , saying the stadium would only be used for " great sporting events , " not the detention of rioters .	in 1971 , u.s. authorities set up an emergency detention center next to washington 's rfk stadium to hold demonstrators after the largest mass arrest in u.s. history .	% ( at ) ap links 173-a-12 - ( london mayor boris johnson , with reporters ) - " on our streets " - london mayor boris johnson says there 's no place for complacency after several nights of riots .	courtesy : sky news ( ( mandatory on-air credit ) ) ( 11 aug 2011 ) << cut * 173 ( 08/11/11 ) >> 00:12 " on our streets " 159-c-15 - ( marta migdalek ( mihg-dahl ' - ehk ) , correspondent ) - " dealt with quickly " - correspondent marta migdalek reports calm prevailed overnight in london with a highly visible police presence .

( ap ) ?	west virginia delegates approved a ban on abortions after 20 weeks conception wednesday , similar to the one gov. earl ray tomblin vetoed last year over constitutionality concerns .	with several lawmakers reciting bible verses and anti-abortion advocates erupting in rounds of applause , the house of delegates approved the ban 87-12 .	most democrats sided with the republican majority .	the bill bans abortions after 20 weeks , with some exemptions for women in medical emergencies .	rape and incest are n't exempted , despite democratic attempts to include them . "	if you so strongly worry about those ( rape ) victims , which i hope all of you do , then i urge you to not punish the child , but to punish the one who impregnated her without her permission , " said del. .	saira blair , an 18-year-old berkeley republican and the nation 's youngest lawmaker .	the proposal would also prohibit abortions when women have psychological conditions that could lead them to hurt themselves badly or kill themselves .	even for abortions that would be exempted , the bill requires doctors to terminate pregnancies in a way that " gives the best opportunity for the fetus to survive , " unless the process would kill or irreparably harm the mother .	doctors and other medical workers who perform banned abortions could face discipline from a medical board , and potentially lose their licenses to practice .	women who get abortions would n't be punished .	in nearly two hours of debate wednesday , proponents of the ban cited moral and religious grounds .	opponents said the proposal is intrusive into doctor-patient relationships and likely unconstitutional . "	what we 're doing is robbing other women from making their own choice , " said del. .	nancy guthrie , d-kanawha . "	we 're saying to them , ' our way is the only way .	you must adhere to what we believe and our opinions . ' "	the bill is based on the assertion that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks , an idea that is disputed in medical research .	the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists , west virginia chapter opposes the bill , saying it does n't support legislation not based on sound science .	in 2011 , the last year with data available , there were six abortions after 20 weeks in west virginia , according to the centers for disease control and prevention .	last year , the democratic-run legislature passed a similar proposal .	tomblin , an anti-abortion advocate and democrat , vetoed the legislation over concerns that a court would strike it down .	both bills resemble a law struck down in arizona in 2013 that the u.s. supreme court later decided not to reconsider .	tomblin says he 'd veto the same bill again .	the newly minted republican-led legislature only needs a simple majority to overturn policy bill vetoes .	del. .	lynne arvon , r-raleigh , said she cares only about the bill 's moral implications , not whether it 's unconstitutional .	and del. .	john shott , r-mercer , embraced the possibility of a legal challenge .

latin america 's biggest economy will overtake france 's to become the globe 's fifth-largest before 2015 , brazil 's finance minister said tuesday .	minister guido mantega said that while the international monetary fund forecasts brazil will become the fifth-largest economy by 2015 , he thinks it will happen earlier .	he did n't forecast exactly when that would be , however .	mantega 's remarks came just one day after the london-based consulting group center for economics and business research reported that brazil had surpassed britain this year as the world 's sixth-largest economy .	mantega was quoted by the website of the o estado de s. paulo newspaper tuesday as saying that brazil 's gross domestic product is growing twice as fast as the gdps of european countries , " so it is inexorable that in the future we will overcome france and , who knows , even germany if its economy does not perform well . "	brazil 's gdp is expected to grow 3 percent in 2011 and 3.5 percent in 2012 , according to the nation 's central bank .	between 2003 and 2010 , brazil 's economy saw average growth of 4 percent .	mantega said brazil 's growth is due to strong job creation and a stable inflation rate . "	brazil 's economy will continue growing more than the gdps of european countries , which will remain in slow motion , " mantega said monday in a statement released on the ministry 's website .	he cautioned , however , that the brazilian government should not rest on its laurels , noting that even though its economy may become more powerful than those of european nations , " it will take 20 to 30 years before brazilians enjoy a european standard of living . "	investing in social programs and continuing to target the eradication of poverty must remain among the brazilian government 's top goals , mantega said .	to do that , the nation 's economy must continue growing at a rapid clip , so that a wide array of those programs can maintain funding .
janet mitchell figures the northwest alaska village of kivalina has three weeks at most before winter freeze-up begins , so no time is too soon to repair a three-mile pipeline that 's crucial to the fresh water supply in her tiny community . "	once it starts freezing up , it 'll be difficult , " mitchell , the kivalina city administrator , said tuesday .	emergency crews plan to begin those repairs this week in a multi-entity effort , including the alaska native tribal health consortium and the northwest arctic borough .	late summer storms flooded kivalina 's landfill and damaged the community 's water system , which pulls drinking water by pipe from the nearby wulik river .	the pipe was broken in places and " some parts went out to sea , " mitchell said .	the damage to the pipeline left the school and teacher housing without clean water .	two weeks after the school was scheduled to start , classes are still not being held in the inupiat eskimo community , 83 miles north of the arctic circle and 625 miles northwest of anchorage .	school district officials hope to see the 130-student school open by oct. 1 .	school district superintendent norm eck said student counts conducted in october are used by the state to determine funding .	between students and teachers , the district stands to lose up to $ 4 million in state funding if the opening goal is n't met , eck said .	meanwhile , both the village and the borough have declared a disaster in the village , and the borough is asking gov. sean parnell to declare a disaster , which would free up state money to deal with the problem .	state emergency management spokesman jeremy zidek said the governor 's cabinet will take up the issue on wednesday , but ultimately a disaster declaration is the governor 's decision to make .	the borough 's disaster declaration immediately opened up $ 5,000 in emergency funds , said borough emergency manager wendie schaeffer , who is based in the regional hub town of kotzebue , 80 miles southeast of kivalina .	the money has paid for such items as sending 6,000 pounds of safe drinking water to the community of 400 .	the borough also plans to hire a janitor to tend to health consortium workers who will be staying at the school during the repair project , schaeffer said .	but that 's not nearly enough money to foot a hefty repair bill , so the borough would welcome backing from the state through a disaster declaration . "	it 's certainly what we hope for , " schaeffer said . "	i do n't know if the actual threshold has been met , but i hope so . "	the tribal health consortium , which is spearheading the project , is providing about $ 10,000 in parts including 3,000 feet of pipe .	that 's not counting the cost of paying workers to come up with a workable system quickly before winter sets in , even if a more permanent fix is n't tackled until later , said john spriggs , the consortium 's tribal utility consultant . "	we 're dealing with a short window of opportunity , " he said .

here 's a quick country music pop quiz : whose last album sold the most copies ?	brad paisley 's , keith urban 's , tim mcgraw 's or jason aldean 's ?	the answer might surprise those who consider aldean a nashville outsider because of an independent streak ?	in both his label and his career choices .	but with 1.3 million albums sold , according to nielsen soundscan , aldean easily outpaced those three modern-day country icons . "	i 'm proud of it , " aldean said . "	i think because we have n't ever been the media darling , nobody can say you got a huge fan base because you 're in every magazine , you 're in every this and that , you 're winning every award .	we have n't really had that much .	every fan we 've got is because we 've went out and kind of done it grass roots style . "	aldean 's rise seems so fast .	he released his first album in 2006 and put out his fourth , " my kinda party , " on tuesday .	yet really the 33-year-old has been working at it since he was 14 , with his parents escorting him and his guitar to bars and clubs around macon , georgia , until he was old enough to drive .	he skipped college to chase the dream , forming a band and building a following in georgia and florida before moving to nashville in 1998 .	he did n't get his record deal with the independent label broken bow until 2004 .	the way aldean sees it , he 's built his fan base gig by gig , song by song and album by album .	his first dates drew fans in the dozens , but those people left the bar talking about the show . "	then the next year when you come to that club there 's 100 people , then you come back the next year and there 's 500 people , " aldean said . "	it takes a long time to build it that way .	but i think when it works , those fans hopefully will stick around for a while and not be just bandwagon jumpers where they 're just going to ride the ride for a little while till it 's not hot . "	next year aldean will launch a tour where he 'll perform in a mix of amphitheaters and arenas , making the last step on the road to country music 's a-list .	there are also high hopes for " my kinda party " to repeat the success of " wide open , " which spawned three no. 1 singles and a no. 2 . "	very quietly , he gets the job done , " cmt president brian philips said . "	he sells a ton of merchandise .	he 's a hot ticket .	he 's got one of the hottest tours out there .	so the moral of the story is it does n't matter who puts your record out .	it does n't matter how many awards you win .	it does n't matter how many fluffy press releases you are in .	at the end of the day the fans will find you if you work . "	that showed in the sales figures for aldean 's last album .	soundscan figures show " wide open " has sold about twice as many physical albums as paisley 's " american saturday night " ( 663,000 ) and also topped mcgraw 's " southern voice " ( 733,000 ) and urban 's " defying gravity " ( 906,000 ) . "	wide open " also outsold kenny chesney 's 2008 studio release , " lucky old sun " ( 804,000 ) .	producer michael knox , who saw an aldean show in atlanta and brought the singer to nashville , said aldean has cultivated an honest sound that draws young fans like the pied piper , pulling them away from those traditional favorites . "	jason 's got a lot more edge than those guys do , " knox said . "	the kids now that are buying records ... when they listen to oldies that 's the '80s . "	he added : " he was brought up on alabama and traditional country music as well .	then he was also influenced by guns n ' roses ?	the transition to the arena rock country act .	i think that 's what 's given him the edge on some of those guys .	he 's coming across like motley crue instead of kind of wearing belt buckles and cowboy hats .

photos do n't do it justice . "	that 's what i 'd heard from almost everyone i spoke with before embarking on my very first trip to crater lake national park .	as i clicked through hundreds of photos in the statesman journal 's photo archives , i considered myself prepared to feast my eyes on the giant body of water that everyone spoke so fondly of . "	eh , " i thought to myself . "	a lake is a lake , right ? "	as i drove my way up the hill toward the second-deepest lake in the world , my stomach did flip flops .	this was my first camping trip of the summer , at one of the most beautiful places on earth , and since camping ranks in my top five favorite activities , i could n't contain my excitement .	tapping my fingers on the steering wheel and singing along with the music playing through my car speakers , i rounded the corner to see a flash of the bright blue water and my natural reaction was n't something fit for print .	i can not emphasize just how shocked i was to see the beautiful blue water of the massive lake ?	and it 's true ?	photos do n't even begin to do it justice .	after picking up three friends in eugene , the three-hour drive flew by with the company of good music and great people , but as soon as we could , we hopped out of the car and started snapping photos .	eventually we got over the initial shock of the pure beauty and headed to our campsite about 8 miles away from rim drive ?	the road that encircles the lake .	for $ 21 per night , you can stay at the mazama campgrounds which are the closest campgrounds to the lake .	the grounds have a variety of amenities including showers , restrooms , a small store , laundry services and more .	each campsite is rather large .	most are equipped with a picnic table , fire grate and a metal box to put food and or garbage in at night so the bears ca n't get into it .	( do n't fret , a bear has n't been seen at crater lake in more than two years . )	while the campsites are a great place to hang out in during the evening , i was n't there to just sit around a fire , although that was wonderful .	saturday morning we awoke after a chilly slumber ( it gets rather cold at night so pack warm clothes ) and made some breakfast .	eggs , bacon , bagels and coffee made for a great start to the day .	a word to the wise : bring a cast iron skillet .	it may be the most valuable cooking tool you 'll use while camping .	after a camping feast , we packed our backpack with snacks , sunscreen , swimsuits and bug spray and set out for a hike .	since it 's still very early in the season for summer activities at crater lake , many of the trails were still closed due to snow and unsafe conditions .	we decided a trek down to the water was necessary , and got on cleetwood cove trail , a 2.2-mile hike round trip .	side note : the mazama campgrounds are about 8 miles away from cleetwood cove , so you have to drive to get there , but there 's ample parking near the trailhead .	the hike is made up of several steep switch backs and takes about 30 minutes to descend .	on the way down i could n't help but to continuously take photos , as the view just keeps getting better .	once at the bottom , a rocky lake shore leads to the crystal blue waters of the 1,943-foot deep , 6.03-mile wide lake .	it was the first time that three out of the four of us had ever been to crater lake , therefore a jump in the water was necessary .	after scouting out a good spot on a giant rock , we took turns jumping into the water , ice cold from the season 's melted snow .	the initial shock of the freezing water took my breath away and chilled me to the bone .	but it was worth it .	after drying off and warming up we headed back up the steep trail toward the car .	while the switchbacks seem pretty daunting , and are rather steep , the trail has strategically placed benches throughout for the hikers to sit and catch their breath .	( i consider myself to be in pretty good shape and even i stopped a few times , partly to admire the beautiful view . )	back at the top of the trail , the view was incredible .	we walked up the closed road a little bit to see the lake from a different perspective , and from higher points on rim drive , the lake seems like something out of a fairy tale ?	completely unreal .	for those who have never been to crater lake i highly recommend visiting this summer ?	it 's a phenomenal spot .	if you go what : crater lake national park gps : 42.965009 , -122.150455 when : the park is always open , but some of the roads and facilities are closed during the winter .	for more information on the facilities , weather , trails , roads , and current conditions go to nps.gov / crla/planyourvisit/current-conditions .	htm .	directions : head south on interstate 5 for 65 miles to take exit 188 toward oakridge / klamath falls and after .4 miles merge onto highway 58 .	after 86 miles take the ramp onto highway 97s for 18 miles and then turn right onto highway 138w for 15 miles .	take a left onto highway 209 / crater lake highway n. ( asterisk ) ( asterisk ) note : there 's construction on interstate 5 just south of cottage grove .	the actual construction site is only eight miles long , but since the freeway is limited to only one lane on each side for those eight miles , it causes serious delays .	on a sunday evening we sat still for more than an hour .	also , the mosquitoes are terrible this time of year so bring bug spray and lots of clothing to cover your body especially in the evening .
oohs , ahs and a small round of applause welcomed the first round of wood-fired pottery revealed from the lansing area 's only wood-fired kiln .	about 300 pieces of pottery faced the flames of the first firing of the kiln located behind clayworks pottery in wacousta .	the unique kiln leaves a glaze upon the pieces , giving them a sheen and other unpredictable effects , such as a drip-look created by the wood 's resin . "	that color , that wood color , you do n't get it anywhere else , " said clayworks member and east lansing resident liz meyers . "	that drippy glaze , you ca n't get that anywhere else . "	the closest kiln of its kind is in kalamazoo , meyers said .	one by one , pitchers , plates , vases , even a teapot , were removed from the kiln .	kilns are more commonly fueled by electricity .	the idea to build a wood-burning kiln began more than two years ago , when lansing resident john masterson and laingsburg resident jim reinert approached the pottery co-op about creating the kiln with the idea that it also could be used by the community .	the estimated $ 10,000 kiln was paid for with loans from mostly co-op members , meyers said . "	when we first did this , we were worried about just getting the kiln fired , " reinert said . "	now we can work on the refinements . "	the kiln burned for three days , with potters taking shifts to supply the kiln with more wood .	reinert said that time period could change along with other details , such as the strength of the fire or where to place the pieces inside the kiln to get the desired effect .	meyers said the hope is to welcome the community to use the kiln and charge a small fee that could pay off the loans it took to build it .	the next firing is expected to be late summer .
when nearly 100 new chicago firefighters crossed the stage thursday to shake mayor rahm emanuel 's hand during their graduation , most of them did so after waiting ?	and fighting ?	for almost two decades to join the chicago fire department .	about 6,000 african americans were passed over because of the city 's discriminatory handling of a firefighters ' entrance exam in 1995 .	after years of lawsuits , a federal appeals court ordered the city last year to hire those who passed that exam ?	and they included 86 of thursday 's 98 graduating firefighters , including at least two in their 50s .	the graduates also included jerry jones iii , 40 , who was working as a cement finisher when the legal fight finally ended .	his father is a retired assistant commissioner . "	it was challenging at times , but everything happens for a reason .	i just took it to mean this is my time and that time was probably not the best time for me to come on the job , " jones told the chicago sun-times .	the 1995 test was intended to measure an aptitude for firefighting .	anyone who scored 64 or below was deemed not qualified .	but officials told those who scored above that number that even though they passed , the department would only randomly hire the top 1,800 who scored 89 or better .	because only 11 percent of the african americans scored 89 or better , the overwhelming number of applicants hired from that test were white .	the attorney for the black firefighters , joshua karsh , said the test was discriminatory because there was no evidence that applicants who scored 89 or above would be better firefighters than those who scored 64 .	a federal judge ruled in 2005 that the test discriminated against black candidates .	the said the city knew the cutoff point was meaningless and would disproportionately exclude blacks from the pool of candidates who were most likely to be hired .	attorneys had argued that had the city selected firefighters at random from all the people who passed the exam , the result would have been a pool of equally capable firefighters but more integrated .	the class-action lawsuit eventually made its way to the u.s. supreme court , which ruled that it was n't too late for the claims to be made .	a federal appeals court then ruled that the chicago fire department needed not only to hire 111 black firefighters , but also provide back pay to those who do n't get hired .	city officials announced earlier this month that they will borrow about $ 80 million dollars to settle the case . "	when you deal with something painful from the past , justice is served by being upfront about it , " emanuel said during thursday 's ceremony . "	we are a stronger city for having dealt with it . "	those who became firefighters thursday had to pass a physical exam , drug test and background check before entering the academy . "	it was very , very hard , mainly because i had n't been to school in so long and i went from being in authority to having ( to answer to authority ) like i was when i was 18 years old , " 43-year-old sherman taylor , who worked as a civilian lock-up employee at the chicago police department , told the sun-times . "	it was n't easy .	body do n't heal as fast .	but , i feel like it was my calling .	all we wanted was a chance ?	and we got it .	seventeen years later , but we did it . "
earlier in the day thursday , anna jennings was complaining to her friends that her gettysburg re-enactor boyfriend still had n't proposed .	patrick mccarthy took part in the morning re-enactment of the battle of gettysburg before a crowd of thousands .	afterward he took jennings to a field behind the union camp , and got down on one knee .	as mccarthy opened the black-velvet box , jennings covered her mouth and squealed .	she nodded for mccarthy to put the ring on , and gave him her hand .	he slid the black and emerald ring onto her finger .	the newly-engaged couple kissed and walked over , smiling , to their friends and others who saw the proposal .	mccarthy got her a custom-made ring through an online company . "	it 's very non-traditional , " said michelle rahm of ourcustomweddingrings.com , who with her family came from colorado to watch the proposal .	mccarthy had the phrase , " together , we are unlimited " engraved inside the ring .	jennings explained that phrase is from her favorite broadway musical , " wicked . "	the biggest surprise for jennings , shaking with excitement after saying " yes , " was the ring , she said .	mccarthy , 27 , traveled to be in the re-enactment as a union soldier .	jennings , 24 , came to wear the civil war dresses she made .	the couple have been together for four years , and went to the 145th gettysburg anniversary as friends .	they met in a civil war club at their college , grand valley state university in michigan , but did n't start dating until a year later .	mccarthy majored in both physics and math while jennings graduated with a theater degree .	mccarthy and jennings drove nine hours to gettysburg from appleton , wis. .	the couple talked the entire nine-hour drive , since they never run out of things to talk about , jennings said .	the bride-to-be could n't stop gushing about mccarthy after he surprised her .

officials in west springfield have ordered a local pizza parlor owner to take down a statue of the virgin mary he put on a city-owned traffic island because it 's in violation of the constitutional separation of church and state .	antonio liquori of liquori 's pizza says he put the statue up last year as part of a city beautification project in which business owners adopted traffic islands to maintain .	liquori tells wwlp-tv ( http://bit.ly/13xowqv ) he recently received a letter from the city 's deputy director of operations , vincent desantis , saying there have been several complaints about the madonna statue .	the letter read : " unfortunately , in this day and age , religious artifacts are not to be displayed on city property .

employees at new jersey network received 45-day layoff notices tuesday as the public television and radio network prepares to move off the government payroll .	it remains to be seen whether the station moves off the air jan. 1 , when it stops receiving state funding and the layoffs take effect .	gov. chris christie , who believes the state does not need and can not afford its own tv station , eliminated state funding for the station in this year 's budget .	he has proposed transferring operations and licenses to a private , nonprofit broadcast outlet .	a legislative task force last month agreed with him , but little has been done to prepare the station for transfer .	the notices said the layoffs were done " for reasons of economy , " but provided few other details about the fate of new jersey 's only public network .	njn was incorporated in 1968 and went on the air in 1971 .	its purpose was to provide new jersey-specific programming for viewers living between the major new york city and philadelphia markets .	new jersey has two commercial tv stations , wmgm in atlantic city and wwor in secaucus . "	today is really a very difficult day for our loyal staff because the layoff notices have been circulated without any clear description from the executive and legislative branches as to the means of transferring njn to a new entity , " said kent manahan , chairman of the new jersey public broadcasting authority board , which oversees njn .	the notices went out to 130 employees ; 17 additional employees who are paid through a private foundation are also expected to receive layoff notices , said janice selinger , the acting executive director of njn public television .	if the governor 's office and legislature do n't act before jan. 1 , the station would go dark .	however , both branches have " expressed the sentiment that they want us to thrive and continue , " selinger said , adding that the station just started a new series and continues to fundraise , although that has become more difficult , she said .	communications workers of america local 1032 president patrick kavanagh called on the governor and legislature to provide funding until a deal can be completed . "	to convert njn to another form requires authorizing legislation to be passed , an audit of assets to be done , and for the federal communications commission to approve a license transfer , " kavanagh said . "	that 's not going to happen in a month and half . "	christie has proposed legislation to direct his treasurer to take inventory of the network 's assets to figure out the best way to sell or transfer them .	he also wants to begin negotiations with other public broadcasting outlets interested in purchasing the network and its broadcasting licenses .	the station has four broadcasting and eight radio licenses .	the licenses can be sold only to other public television stations or religious broadcasters but estimates are uncertain about how much money the state could make by selling them .	while other states have government-owned stations , njn is unique in that it produces a nightly newscast and is one of the few stations to carry gubernatorial budget addresses live .	it is also a member of the pbs network and npr network for radio , broadcasting public programming as well as producing original broadcasts .	if the station were to come off the air in january , it would have a year before the federal communications commission could take back the broadcast licenses , according to ellen goodman , an information policy law professor at rutgers law school-camden .	christie spokesman kevin roberts said the layoff notices were necessary as njn becomes independent from the state and said the administration was working with the legislature to come up with a transition process .

it really is bad to have too much debt .	yes , humphrey bogart was one heck of an actor .	and , no , you really should n't have eaten that , because you did n't know where it had been .	your grandparents were also right when they said that utilities stocks are a good way to get current income and modest price appreciation with relatively low volatility .	see ?	it can pay to listen to your grandparents .	utilities stocks have long been called widow-and-orphan stocks because brokers could sell them to the most conservative investors without getting sued .	and there 's some truth to that : utilities are inherently boring .	but these days , boring is better .	the dow jones industrial average is down 7.3 ( percent ) this year , vs. a 5.6 ( percent ) gain for the dow jones utility average .	for one thing , utilities are very predictable .	it 's unlikely that we 'll stop using electricity and run air conditioners on our brain waves .	furthermore , most electric utilities are closely regulated , which means that big earnings surprises -- both up and down -- are unusual .	utilities are likely to get some rate increases as they replace some of their infrastructure . "	there has n't been a lot of infrastructure spending since the 1950s and early 1960s , " says tim o'brien , portfolio manager of the wells fargo advantage utility and telecommunications funds .	power outages are not things that politicians like to hear about , but big building projects often make politicians happy , says ron sorenson , ceo of w.h. reaves & co. " these are big investments that create lots of jobs . "	he says .	and then there 's yield .	the dow utility average has yielded 4.23 ( percent ) the past 12 months , according to bloomberg news .	the bellwether 10-year treasury note yields 1.73 ( percent ) , a record low . "	a 4.23 ( percent ) yield is more attractive than it ever has been , " says alec young , global equity strategist at standard & poor 's capital iq .	and , at least for now , the tax rate on qualified dividends is 15 ( percent ) .	another advantage for utilities : let 's say you asked your bond issuer to raise its payout .	you 'd be met by hearty laughter and a good-natured call for security .	but utility stocks can -- and often do -- raise their dividend rate .	consider the southern co. ( ticker : so ) , which produces and distributes electricity in the southeast .	the company raised its annual dividend by 7 cents in april , bringing the annual dividend to $ 1.89 a share .	ten years earlier , the dividend rate was $ 1.34 a share .	finally , utilities have seen some benefit from falling natural gas prices . "	natural gas prices are very low , and supply is getting more prolific , " sorenson says .	the problem , of course , is that utilities are n't exactly undiscovered .	if you look at utilities vs. the broad stock market , prices are high when compared with earnings .	typically , a utility 's price-earnings ratio -- stock price divided by forecast 12-months earnings -- is less than the p-e of the standard and poor 's 500 .	by that measure , utilities are more expensive than normal .	but many people look to utilities for income , and when you compare utilities with bonds , they 're cheap , o'brien says .	if you 're looking for a utility stock , bear in mind that some states have tougher regulations than others , and not all utilities operate on the same playing field . "	the outlook in california is very different from the outlook in georgia , " sorenson says .	if you 're looking for utilities stocks , look for those with a long history of raising their dividends .	four large utilities that have raised their dividends the past 12 months , in addition to the southern co. : dominion resources ( d ) , duke energy ( duk ) , american electric power ( aep ) and consolidated edison ( ed ) .	you might also consider investing in a utilities fund .	as with any income-producing fund -- or any fund , for that matter -- look for low expenses .	the less you give to your fund manager , the more you get to keep for yourself .	and with yields this low , you do n't want to give much away .	during a rip-snorting bull market , people will tell you that utilities stocks are for your grandparents , and that growth is the way to go .	but do n't sell your grandparents short .	utilities can be a huge help in a bear market .

the world trade organization ruled friday that the united states is illegally taxing about $ 2 billion a year of imported brazilian frozen orange juice .	brazil 's victory comes after similar u.s. losses in trade disputes over how it applies its complex " zeroing " methodology ?	calculations that are used to determine how much to punish imports suspected of being " dumped " at unfairly low prices .	brazil is the world 's largest exporter of frozen orange juice , selling mainly to the european union and the united states .	it filed the complaint in 2008 saying the u.s. artificially inflates the dumping margins .	the u.s. has lost similar wto decisions .	a wto panel ruled that washington 's method used to calculate when orange juice was dumped , or sold at less-than-cost prices on u.s. markets , was illegal .	the ruling means that some u.s. antidumping duties imposed on imports of orange juice from south america 's largest nation violated international trade rules .	the panel said the united states acted " inconsistently " by applying the zeroing methodology to set extra duties on brazilian orange juice .	the united states imports about $ 2 billion , or a fifth of all brazil 's orange juice exports .	brazil 's wto mission in geneva welcomed the ruling , saying : " the brazilian government hopes that the united states brings its measure into conformity without delay , as a clear sign of respect to the multilateral trade disciplines . "	the european union also has challenged washington 's zeroing methodology .	the u.s. commerce department published a proposal in late december for ending some uses of zeroing ?	and avoiding more trade disputes with the eu , japan and other key trading partners .

south carolina election officials do n't yet know where they 'll get an additional $ 500,000 to run next month 's first-in-the-south presidential primary , but they assure voters the contest will occur .	election commission spokesman chris whitmire said tuesday his agency has notified the state budget office it wo n't have enough money to run the high-profile jan. 21 contest . "	we do n't know exactly what will happen now , " whitmire said . "	how any shortfall will be made up remains to be seen . "	the state republican party informed the agency monday it wo n't contribute any money beyond the $ 180,000 it collected in filing fees from the nine candidates on the ballot .	state law requires those fees to help pay for the primary , expected to cost up to $ 1.5 million .	the state agency will have $ 1 million on hand for the contest less than six weeks away , including money left over from conducting 2010 elections and the fees the gop turned in last month , whitmire said .	the state gop had previously agreed to pay the balance .	but that was before four counties sued over their costs .	the supreme court ruled last month the state and counties were responsible for the contest ?	a decision gop chairman chad connelly called a " game changer . " "	the state gop simply can not be involved beyond what is written in the supreme court ruling , federal , and state law , " connelly wrote in an email tuesday to gop executive committee members , noting the fee . "	the state party was negotiating in good faith with these four counties through the state election commission , yet they filed a hugely expensive lawsuit knowing that this was one of the potential outcomes . "	while the state 's high court answered questions on authority , it did not address funding .	an attorney for the counties , lee floyd , said the gop incorrectly infers the ruling bars it from contributing . "	if they wanted to contribute , they certainly could , " he said .	whitmire said the commission could ask the five-member budget oversight board to let the agency operate in the red .	the board , led by gov. nikki haley , has let agencies run a deficit in previous years .	but the first-year governor has railed against the practice .	or legislators could vote when they return to columbia in january to transfer money to the agency .	the state 's 2010-11 fiscal year closed june 30 with a $ 128 million surplus .	earlier this year , haley argued no taxpayer money should go toward the presidential primary .	but legislators overrode her budget veto in june of what was estimated at the time to be $ 670,000 from the state .	haley said tuesday the gop response surprised her , and she 'll likely " pick up the phone and find out what happened . " "	i read it and i did n't see that coming , " she told the associated press . "	i have always said that i think primaries should be paid with private funds .	i do n't think taxpayers should pay for it and i stand by that . "	however it 's paid for , it will be conducted no differently from previous primaries , whitmire said . "	we do know we 're required to do it under the law , " he said . "	the supreme court made that very clear . "	the state will reimburse counties as it does for any other statewide election , covering expenses for poll managers , polling places , postage , supplies , ballots and ballot printing .	but counties argued they had other expenses that were n't covered , such as the cost of temporary help , truck rentals to deliver machines and additional electricity .	the state gop agreed to pay for all " legitimate expenses " related to the contest , and the state commission informed counties it would determine whether a claim was a direct cost , whitmire said .	in a dispute over defining " legitimate , " election officials in beaufort , chester , greenville and spartanburg counties sued the state election commission and the state 's republican and democratic parties in october .	they argued the primary was a private affair that the state lacked the money to handle , and said their taxpayers would end up covering part of the tab .	some costs under dispute included a share of maintenance contracts and county employees ' salaries , whitmire said .	the counties offered to dismiss the lawsuit if the republican party put $ 1.9 million in escrow to reimburse all 46 counties for their expenses .	their attorney , joel collins , said the state gop never made a counteroffer , and officials in the republican-dominated counties were trying to be fiscally responsible by sorting out the funding details in advance ?	and get it in writing . "	we were prepared to negotiate down from that number , " collins said .	the state 's high court refused on a 3-2 vote nov. 22 to block the primary , turning back the counties ' challenge that the state lacked the authority to hold the contest .	collins accuses the state gop , the party of fiscal responsibility that 's supposed to oppose unfunded mandates , of reneging on a public promise with monday 's response and leaving taxpayers with the bill .	gop executive director moore said the party was negotiating with the state , rather than separate counties . "	we were in the middle of that discussion , and they filed a lawsuit , " moore said . "	they lost and will have to pay the consequences . "

kentucky lawmakers took $ 700,000 in excess funds from the agency that oversees charitable gaming in 2008 and to help pay off a $ 265 million shortfall in the budget .	should the state have been allowed to juggle the finances like that ?	the state supreme court on wednesday asked that .	the court is examining two cases challenging how much flexibility the governor and legislature have in using fees collected by regulatory agencies for something other than overseeing the industries paying the money .	the question arose in two lawsuits brought against the state .	a group of non-profits , led by the louisville soccer alliance , and a group of home builders challenged the use of the fees to pay off general fund debt accrued by the state .	in both cases , attorneys said fees collected to pay for regulation can be used only for that purpose .	converting the regulatory fees to general use is tantamount to making the fees taxes , which legislators did n't levy on the industries in question , said attorney edward o'daniel , who represents the home builders and contractors . "	that excess money , if taken , constitutes a tax , " said oliver barber , who represents the non-profits .	steve pitt , the attorney handling the case for the state , said lawmakers acted within their legal ability when taking the money .	whether the move is popular or not is n't before the justices , pitt said . "	it 's a political and legislative concern , not a court concern , " pitt said .	the justices did not give an indication as to when they would rule in the two cases .	both the charitable gaming outlets and the home builders sued after gov. steve beshear took $ 700,000 from the office of charitable gaming and more than $ 4 million from the office that regulates home builders and contractors .	they were part of $ 51 million in state money moved around to close the $ 265 million shortfall in 2008 .	a trial court found the move unconstitutional in 2011 , but the kentucky court of appeals reversed that decision and upheld the governor 's decision .	justice michelle keller , hearing her first cases on the high court , quizzed barber and o'daniel on what would become of the excess funds collected each year . "	those funds would be used in the future to reduce the fee paid by the regulated contractors , " o'daniel said .	pitt challenged both assertions , saying there will almost always be excess funds collected by regulatory agencies .	pitt said it is " literally impossible " to precisely match the fee rate and collections to the cost of regulation .	kentucky law requires a balanced budget and shortfalls do n't always occur when the legislature is in session , pitt said .	lawmakers gave their blessing to beshear 's actions ratifying his decision during the 2008 session and suspending the law barring the transfer , pitt said . "	and , just as the general assembly has the constitutional authority to suspend 47 statutes in a budget bill , it has equal constitutional authority to suspend 150 statutes , " pitt said .	as long as the fees collected are related to the regulations set out in the law , collecting them is legal .	pitt relied on a similar move in 1984 , when gov. john y. brown transferred money from regulatory agencies to balance the state budget .	the state high court blessed that decision in 1986 .	justice will t. scott noted the state has gone to the well of excess regulatory funds five times in the last 10 years to cover budget shortfalls .

illinois house members said tuesday that senate president john cullerton 's pension reform proposal saves less than 60 percent of what he has predicted .	reps. elaine nekritz and darlene senger released numbers from an actuarial study of the cullerton plan that showed it would reduce the public employee pension system debt , now at $ 97 billion , by less than $ 6 billion .	cullerton , a chicago democrat , says his plan would reduce that obligation by $ 10 billion .	lawmakers continue to wrestle with the monstrous unfunded liability ; there are just 10 days left in the scheduled session of the general assembly .	nekritz and senger met with reporters to lay out the calculations on the cullerton bill , which was done by pension system actuaries .	but they noted the decrease could vary depending on factors used to compute it ?	house democrats say $ 5.2 billion , the gop says $ 5.7 billion .	nekritz , a northbrook democrat , and senger , a republican from naperville , are behind a house-approved plan they say would reduce the liability by about $ 28 billion .	it awaits senate action while cullerton 's bill is in the house . "	the choice between the two proposals has always been about how does the math add up ? "	nekritz said .

as a kid , gary mechanic did n't think twice about playing along the banks of the chicago river , just a half block from his home , despite the sewage and industrial runoff that fouled the waterway when it rained .	he remembers when the fox river farther west was so polluted it was rare to see people canoeing or fishing .	today , he is paddling rivers that have undergone dramatic yet incomplete transformations as cities throughout illinois spend hundreds of millions of dollars to stop sewage from pouring into them during heavy rains . "	i 've seen a lot of changes in the rivers around here , " said mechanic , a partner in a new canoe livery along the fox river in aurora , about 40 miles west of chicago .	now the u.s. environmental protection agency says it 's time to fix the problem once and for all , even as most local governments face difficult budget problems .	communities from chicago to belleville to galesburg to peoria have been ordered to deal with antiquated sewer systems , many built more than 100 years ago , that route sewage and storm water through the same pipes .	during heavy rains , that means bacteria-laden water pours into rivers , streams and lakes , making waterways unsafe for swimming and other recreational activities .	overflows occur in 121 illinois communities .	they fouled 250 miles of rivers and streams from 2006 through 2008 , according to the illinois epa .	chicago 's system also dumps untreated sewage into lake michigan during heavy storms .	the federal government has ordered cities to develop plans for how they will limit overflows to no more than four per year or capture 85 percent of the volume when the systems do overflow .	most plans must be completed by the end of september , to be implemented over a specific time period , sometimes up to two decades .	for chicago , the solution already includes cavernous underground tunnels that hold storm water until it can be pumped to a treatment plant .	belleville is using large lagoons to do the same thing .	galesburg has four remote treatment facilities to help during storms , and is separating the pipes that carry sewage and storm water .	communities that do n't have approved plans ?	43 in illinois ?	are feeling increasing pressure from state and federal environmental officials to get them done , including violation notices sent to 13 of them , most within the past two years , illinois epa officials said . "	we put a high priority on this because it goes to a number of different issues , including public health , the health of the river system and recreational uses , " said bruce yurdin , who manages the illinois epa 's field offices across the state .	fixes wo n't be cheap , and will require many communities to take out loans and raise sewer and water rates to pay for them .	but advocates say the high price is an investment with big payoffs for the environment , public health and the economy .	chicago already has spent $ 3 billion on improvements over the past four decades ?	including tunnels up to 35 feet in diameter ?	but still has not stopped the overflows .	it plans to spend $ 1 billion more to build two reservoirs , expected to be completed in 2029 , to help .	the city of belleville plans to spend $ 88 million ?	and likely raise sewer and water rates over the next 20 years to pay for it ?	to send overflows to two large lagoons where it can be held until it can be treated .	overflows go into a creek that is n't a recreational waterway .	but the creek empties into the kaskaskia river , popular with anglers and paddlers , said royce carlisle , director of the city 's wastewater division .	he said officials also worry about the city 's ability to grow if overflows are n't controlled . "	we do n't want the epa to say we ca n't add anything to the ... system , " he said galesburg has separated most of its storm and sanitary sewers , built satellite treatment plants in neighborhoods and closed off a dozen outlets that used to dump wastewater into an open ditch .	but overflows still happen ?	seven to eight times a year in the past three years ?	because many houses still divert storm water directly to the sewers , said steve davis , superintendent of the galesburg sanitary district .	so the district will spend an estimated $ 2.5 million to triple the capacity of a lagoon at the main treatment plant , and davis said a rate increase probably will be needed to pay back any loans used to complete the project .	another concern about overflows into waterways is that storm water is n't sinking back into the land and recharging groundwater .	communities should begin looking at ways to slow or stop storm water from getting into sewer systems in the first place , said henry henderson , director of the natural resource defense council 's midwest program .	some communities have set aside green space , built plant-covered rooftops and streets that allow water to soak into the ground .	aurora has done a good job by expanding open space and building streetscapes to help control water runoff , henderson said . "	water is at the heart of sustainability of all our communities , " henderson said . "	investing in and improving water is not just an environmental issue , but it 's about sustainability and the growth of the midwest economy . "	despite the costs , the water-quality improvements to date in many communities have been dramatic ?	and could pay off economically , said the state epa 's yurdin .	in chicago , some parts of the river have improved so much that it 's no longer rare to see schools of paddlers in colorful kayaks , and the banks are lined with restaurants , housing and hotels .	in aurora , the sewer system overflowed 1,100 times in 1983 , but just 178 times last year , after the city spent $ 200 million on controls that included a special treatment plant .	it still plans to spend another $ 120 million over 20 years to build another treatment plant and separate more sewers , said eric schoeny , an engineer with the city 's public works department .	now condominiums are being built along the fox river , the city is redeveloping a park that will include a canoe launch and entertainment space and anglers are returning to a waterway that barely supported aquatic life 25 years ago ?	but now yields smallmouth bass and the occasional walleye and northern pike , schoeny said . "	i do n't think that would have happened before , " said schoeny . "	after it rained there would be all sorts of disgusting evidence of ( combined sewer ) discharges .	now i think a lot more people taking advantage of the river and realizing what a great resource it is . "	mechanic , the canoeist , says he 's seen the payoff first hand along the banks of the chicago river . "	i remember that when my grandparents bought their ( chicago home ) , the property value was depressed by its proximity to the river , " he said . "	today , the river is so attractive that developers are competing to buy and develop million-dollar condos . "

for 33 men found alive after 17 days trapped deep in a copper and gold mine , the toughest challenge now may be preserving their sanity during the months it may take to carve a tunnel big enough for them to get out .	for their families above ground , euphoria and more anxiety meant for a sleepless night at the realization that they may be stuck underground for up to four more months . "	we did n't sleep .	we stayed up all night long hoping for more news .	they said that new images would appear , so we were up hoping to see them , " said one , carolina godoy .	dawn broke behind a cold fog on the surface of the gold and copper mine in chile 's atacama desert , where an intense rescue effort finally reached the miners on sunday after weeks of missteps , new cave-ins and other false starts .	now the plan is to drill a wider tunnel , just big enough for the men to be pulled out one by one .	that equipment that works more slowly , so officials estimate it could take until december to rescue them .	a narrow drill broke through 2,257 feet ( 688 meters ) of solid rock sunday to reach the emergency refuge where the miners have gathered .	the trapped men quickly tied two notes to the end of a probe that rescuers pulled to the surface , announcing in big red letters : " all 33 of us are fine in the shelter . " "	today all of chile is crying with excitement and joy , " president sebastian pinera said at the mine .	and where many were beginning to give up hope , the scene above ground became a celebration sunday night , with a barbecue for the miners ' families , roving musicians , lit candles and chilean flags making the barren landscape seem festive .	the men already have been trapped underground longer than all but a few miners rescued in recent history .	last year , three miners survived 25 days trapped in a flooded mine in southern china , and two miners in northeastern china were rescued after 23 days in 1983 .	few other rescues have taken more than two weeks .	the miners ' survival after 17 days is very unusual , but since they 've made it this far , they should emerge physically fine , said davitt mcateer , who was assistant secretary for mine safety and health at the u.s. labor department under president bill clinton . "	the health risks in a copper and gold mine are pretty small if you have air , food and water , " mcateer said .	still , he said the stress of being trapped underground for a long period of time can be significant . "	there is a psychological pattern there that we 've looked at , " mcateer said .	but " they 've established communication with the guys ; there are people who can talk them through that . "	the hole already drilled will be used to send down small capsules containing food , water and oxygen if necessary , and sound and video equipment so the miners can better communicate with loved ones and rescuers .	that two-way communication may be key to keeping them thinking positive .	a video camera lowered down the probe shaft sunday showed some of the miners , stripped to the waist in the underground heat , waving happily .	but they were n't able to establish audio contact , pinera said . "	i saw eight or nine of them .	they were waving their hands .	they got close to the camera and we could see their eyes , their joy , " the president said .	the miners seemed to be aware that their rescue may take a long time , according to one of them , mario gomez , perhaps the eldest of the trapped men at 63 , who wrote a note to his wife . "	even if we have to wait months to communicate .	... i want to tell everyone that i 'm good and we 'll surely come out ok , " gomez wrote , scrawling the words on a sheet of notebook paper the miners tied to the probe . "	patience and faith .	god is great and the help of my god is going to make it possible to leave this mine alive . "	mine officials and relatives of the workers had hoped the men reached a shelter below where the tunnel collapsed aug. 5 at the san jose gold and copper mine about 530 miles ( 850 kilometers ) north of the capital , santiago .	but they had said the shelter 's emergency air and food supplies would last only 48 hours .	gomez wrote that the miners used vehicles for light and a backhoe to dig a channel to retrieve underground water .	it was unclear whether their air supply was in danger of running out .	rescuers had drilled repeatedly in an effort to reach the shelter , but failed seven times .	they blamed the errors on the mining company 's maps .	according to gomez 's note , at least some of those earlier probes were close enough that the trapped miners heard them .	the eighth attempt finally worked .	gomez 's note , which the president read aloud on live television , focused on expressions of faith and love for his family .	but frustration also showed through in one line , where he declared that " this company has got to modernize . "	chile is the world 's top copper producer and a leading gold producer , and has some of the world 's most advanced mining operations .	but both the company that owns the mine , san esteban , and the national mining and geology service have been criticized for allegedly failing to comply with regulations .	in 2007 , an explosion at the san jose mine killed three workers .	liliana ramirez could n't believe it when chile 's mining minister said her husband had sent a note to his " dearest lila . " "	i know my husband is strong , and at 63 , is the most experienced miner who could lead his co-workers , " she said , but she vowed to keep him above ground once he 's rescued .	authorities and relatives of the miners hugged , climbed a nearby hill , planted 33 flags and sang chile 's national anthem after discovering the miners had survived .	along the length of chile , horns honked , flags waved and people watched the drama unfold live on television and computer screens .	it was a rush of good news in a country still rebuilding from a magnitude-8 .8 earthquake feb. 27 and its resulting tsunami , which together killed at least 521 people and left 200,000 homeless .
only three wrongfully convicted people have received compensation totaling $ 3.2 million under a florida law passed four years ago , and an advocate said tuesday that it 's unlikely many more will be paid .	that 's partly because of a provision excluding exonerated convicts who committed previous felonies or crimes while in prison . "	the problem is that a number of these other folks who have not been compensated yet will never get compensated under the law because they ca n't get past the clean hands provision , " innocence project of florida executive director seth miller . "	what happened to you before your wrongful conviction has no relation to whether the state owes you recompense for wrongfully incarcerating you . "	the innocence project has focused on dna testing to free inmates sentenced for crimes they did not commit .	six of 13 people the organization lists as having been proven innocent by dna testing since 2003 are excluded from seeking compensation by the clean hands provision , miller said .	many others also have the same trouble .	the death penalty information center lists 22 murder convicts exonerated in florida since 1972 .	most have not been compensated , nor have others exonerated for lesser crimes .	the law pays $ 50,000 for each year spent in prison up to a maximum of $ 2 million .	of the remaining seven exonerated people on the innocence project 's list , only two benefited from the compensation law .	as for the rest , one died before he was exonerated , one obtained a monetary settlement from local authorities and three were compensated by the legislature through the passage of claims bills .	before the compensation law , that was the only way wrongfully convicted people could be reimbursed .	since then , lawmakers have passed claims bills for two exonerated convicts who were excluded from the compensation law due to prior felony convictions .	miller was unsure whether the others also plan to seek claims bills .	the department of financial services approved the latest payment under the compensation law in july .	luis diaz-martinez received nearly $ 1.3 million for 26 years he spent in prison for a series of south florida rapes .	he was released in 2005 as a result of dna testing .	the first payment of $ 179,167 went to leroy mcgee of fort lauderdale in 2010 .	mcgee spent three years , seven months in prison for a robbery he did n't commit .	his trial judge cleared him after finding his since-disbarred lawyer failed to present evidence that proved he was innocent .	james bain received $ 1.75 million last year for 35 years he spent in prison .	bain was released in 2009 after dna testing proved he was innocent of kidnapping and raping a 9-year-old boy in polk county .	miller said legislation repeatedly has been filed in the florida senate since the law was passed to repeal or modify the exclusion .	it has n't gone anywhere because advocates have been unable to find a house sponsor . "	it 's not clear there is a political will within the legislature especially in these down economic times to do anything about it , " miller said .

a tornado on friday swept over the barrier island , damaging property and downing some utility lines before twisting itself back out to sea , residents on the island said . "	everybody was running around screaming that a tornado was coming , " said dodie vegas , owner of bridge side marina . "	we saw it come off caminada pass and touchdown on the property .	it did n't do a lot of damage .	it kind of missed everything and the good thing is everybody 's safe . "	vegas said the sky darkened but there was no rain or hail , just strong wind as the tornado ripped about 40 feet of roof off a nearby motel and knocked down some power lines . "	for a minute , it looked like it was gon na come back at us , but it went back into the bay until we could n't see it anymore , " she said . "	there was another water spout there too , but it disappeared . "	meteorologist christopher bannan of the national weather service in slidell could not confirm the twister but said the weather system also spawned a possible tornado in plaquemines parish , where residents reported a sign down near south plaquemines high school in buras .	maj. john marie , a spokesman for the plaquemines parish sheriff 's office , said there was report of substantial damage to at least one trailer in the area too , but no injuries .

the last time colorado enacted gun control measures was in the wake of the 1999 columbine high school shooting , and once the laws were on the books there was little acrimony .	the state 's latest batch of gun control laws ?	coming after a gunman 's deadly rampage at a suburban denver movie theater a year ago ?	has sparked a struggle over guns that shows little signs of fading .	gun rights advocates are trying to recall two state senators who backed the package , and dozens of republican county sheriffs are suing to overturn it . "	this is going to remain a political hot potato for democrats for many , many months , " said gun-rights activist ari armstrong .	ironically , in the months after the gunman 's shooting spree left 12 people dead and injured 70 others , there was little public discussion of gun control here .	the shooting at a midnight showing of the batman film " the dark knight rises " occurred in a key swing county in one of the most hotly contested battleground states in last year 's presidential election .	but president barack obama , seeking re-election , did not bring up gun control in a state that cherishes its western frontier image .	neither did most colorado democrats .	it was n't until december 's shooting at a connecticut elementary school left 20 first-graders and six adults dead that gun control rose in prominence .	by march , colorado became the only state outside the democratic party 's coastal bases to pass sweeping gun control measures , including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines .	after the columbine attack , voters closed a loophole that allowed buyers of firearms at gun shows to evade background checks .	in the wake of the aurora massacre , the prospects for more gun control in this libertarian-minded state seemed shaky at best .	soon after police say a former neuroscience graduate student named james holmes , armed with a rifle and a high-capacity magazine able to fire 100 bullets , wreaked his carnage , the democratic lawmaker whose district is home to the century 16 movie theater where the shooting took place began drafting gun control bills , hoping coloradans would be more receptive to them .	they were n't . "	there was a sense of political fear , " recalled state rep. rhonda fields , who became a legislator after her son and his girlfriend were shot to death in 2005 to stop him from testifying at a murder trial .	in a television interview days after the shooting , democratic gov. john hickenlooper appeared to cast doubt on the effectiveness of new gun control laws .	despite a push by gun control groups and some relatives of those slain in aurora , moderators at the presidential debates did n't bring up the topic .	craig hughes , a top adviser to obama 's colorado campaign , said it felt inappropriate to raise the issue while emotions were so raw . "	the right course here was to not politicize it , " he said .	hickenlooper said he had quiet conversations around the state after that and was struck by wide support for universal background checks .	in november , democrats won both the state house and senate as colorado helped re-elect obama .	and on dec. 12 , hickenlooper declared that " the time is right " to talk about gun control .	two days later in connecticut , adam lanza , 20 , shot and killed his mother , then drove to sandy hook elementary school and opened fire before killing himself .	the attack shocked a country that had grown hardened to mass shootings .	obama vowed an all-out push for gun control .	in colorado , a similar push was already queued up .	new york city mayor michael bloomberg 's gun control organization , mayors against illegal guns , hired four lobbyists to help push gun bills in colorado .	vice president joe biden called state legislators to urge them to vote for the package .	biden told them that colorado , with its western traditions , could help set the tone for national gun policy .	to republicans and gun rights groups , the message was clear . "	the obama administration and these east coast politicians decided that , as colorado goes , so goes the rest of the nation , ' " said republican state rep. mark waller .	republican legislators fought furiously to delay the bills ' passage .	hundreds of demonstrators circled the state capitol and packed the legislative chambers .	democrats were confident voters were on their side .	they have not lost a presidential , gubernatorial or u.s. senate race for more than a decade , powered by a combination of a growing hispanic voting population and an influx of coastal moderates . "	the voices that are the loudest ( in protest ) are not the ones that determine elections here , " laura chapin , a democratic strategist who worked for local gun control groups , said after the bills passed .	for gun rights advocates , the movie theater attack exposed serious problems that democrats were ignoring : bans on guns in public areas , and the issue of mental health .	holmes purchased his guns legally but also had seen a psychiatrist who feared he was dangerous .	the century 16 complex forbade guns .	if viewers were armed , gun-rights groups argued , they could have stopped the attack .	advocates also noted that , from the limited information that has become public , some officials at the university of colorado , denver , where holmes studied , may have been warned that he could turn violent . "	let 's not pretend our options are binary ?	do nothing or pass more restrictive gun laws , " said armstrong , the gun-rights activist .	the legislature agreed to a $ 20 million hickenlooper plan to expand mental health services .	but the gun control package got the most attention .	the bill banning larger-capacity magazines squeaked through by a single vote in the state senate .	meanwhile , democratic strongholds like new york , connecticut and california passed some measures , but gun control packages died in congress and in liberal-leaning states like minnesota , oregon , washington and even biden 's home state , delaware .	in june , colorado gun activists collected enough signatures to trigger recall elections for two state senators , including that chamber 's president .	if democratic efforts to block them fail , the recall votes could be the first electoral test of post-sandy hook gun control .	fifty-four county sheriffs filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the laws as violations of the second amendment right to bear arms .

language , tipiziwin young will tell you , has the power to heal broken cultures .	especially on south dakota 's nine indian reservations , where poverty , alcoholism and violence continue to shatter lives and homes , young is convinced that the lakota language can be their salvation . "	lakota is the language our creator gave us , " young , who wants to become a lakota language teacher , says from her fort yates , n.d. , home . "	there is a beauty and power in our prayers , our songs and our words .	... that i think can be very healing . "	officials at the university of south dakota in vermillion and sitting bull college in fort yates see those possibilities , too .	that 's why they are developing bachelor 's - degree programs to train teachers of lakota as a second language .	the two schools have been awarded a four-year , $ 2.4 million grant by the department of education to institute the programs beginning next year and , within the initial four years , to educate 30 new lakota language teachers .	the grant will pay for one instructor at each school ?	a lakota linguistics expert for usd and , at sitting bull , an instructor specializing in second language methodology .	the schools will be able to share the instructors , either through distance learning or possibly some travel , officials say .	the grant also will allow 16 native american students at usd and 14 at sitting bull college to receive $ 2,000 a month for two years to pay their tuition , fees and living expenses " this is a once-in-a-lifetime shot to build an important teaching force in the state , " said wil meya , executive director of the lakota language consortium , an indiana-based collaboration among tribal leaders , linguistic experts and second-language education officials to revitalize the lakota language .	meya , whose consortium helped put the grant request together and works on everything from teacher training to textbook creation , said there are more than 120,000 potential lakota speakers in the northern plains .	with the lakota tribes having mandated language instruction in their schools in the mid-1970s , the grant will make possible for " the first time that a native american professional development program will focus on language education , " meya said .	for people such as young , the opportunity to teach a language she heard at her grandfather 's knee is highly valuable . "	my grandpa ... he talked lakota to me when i was little , " young , 30 , said . "	he died when i was young .	every time i hear the language , it brings me back to a perfect time in my childhood , when i was happy and carefree and my grandpa took care of me .	when i hear the language , i feel really good . "	though she has studied lakota , " i 've never found fluency in academic settings because of the teaching methods teachers use , " young said . "	for example , every teacher teaches colors and numbers and kinship terms from preschool all the way up to college level .	but they never teach you sentence structure or verb conjugation . "	sunshine carlow , tribal education manager for the standing rock sioux tribe , said the bachelor 's degrees being offered at usd and sitting bull will emphasize those language structures and provide a continuity in lakota language education that does n't exist .	as students move from family member to family member and community to community , " we 've always thought , ' would n't it be nice to have a common curriculum if they go to wakpala or cannonball or fort yates ? ' "	carlow said . "	these new bachelor programs should standardize the training and make it easier for students to continue their studies as they move . "	the programs also will bolster a teaching profession where the average age of lakota speakers is older than 55 , and where few fluent speakers are younger than 50 , carlow said .	at usd , rick melmer , dean of the school of education , said he hopes the program primarily motivates tribal students to get their degrees , go back to their communities or reservations and fuel the fires of young people there to learn their language .	tribal folks have told him they want that , too , melmer said .	in sioux falls , where there are 1,400 tribal youths in the public school system , the programs at usd and sitting bull also could create needed teachers for courses the district offers its lakota and dakota students , said gail swenson in the office of indian and homeless education . "	once we get our lakota language back as an accredited class in high school , we ca n't stretch one person to three high schools , and continue to rotate that person into the middles schools , too , " swenson said . "	as more native american youth come here , we would have a need for these kinds of teachers . "	at usd at least , the program needs approval from the board of regents - a stamp that melmer said is likely to come .	it also will need to be self-sustaining after the grant dollars go away , paid for by students who want to become lakota teachers .	officials at both schools do n't see that as a problem , either . "	we would n't have worked on this grant for three years if we did n't think there was a demand for this profession , " said meya , who noted that as payback for the financial help , graduates need to work in schools with native students in this area . "	the indian population there in south dakota is growing at three times the rate of the regular population , " he continued . "	we know the students will be there .	this will help make sure qualified teachers are there , too . "
a group of students at a madison high school twice omitted the words " under god " when saying the pledge of allegiance recently , but the school district said the pledge is offered on a daily basis as is required by law .	the wisconsin state journal reported wednesday ( http://tiny.cc/tyt4ex ) that an east high school student claimed that the pledge had not been recited daily until january 2013 , and that was circulated widely among conservative media this week .	but madison school district spokeswoman rachel strauch-nelson said the student was incorrect and the pledge has been offered on a daily basis as state law requires .	during two days in march , students reciting the pledge during morning announcements skipped the words " under god " the first day and said " under peace " the second day , strauch-nelson said . "	both students were followed up with , " she said .	benji backer , a 16-year-old who calls himself a conservative activist and columnist , published a post about the situation last week on a conservative blog .	the post , which relied on information provided by a student at the school , has since been shared by more than a dozen conservative media outlets .	school board member t.j. mertz said he supported the students who may have been acting in support of their beliefs when omitting the words .	he also said he applauded murphy for speaking up for her beliefs . "	we want our students to be self-advocating and have beliefs , " mertz said . "	i support them acting on their beliefs . "	it 's unclear whether the students intentionally or accidentally misread the pledge , mertz said .	he said he has heard it characterized both ways .	board president ed hughes said the board considered the pledge dispute to be a small , contained event that had been overblown .	the dispute comes after the school district drew national attention in 2001 when the school board voted not to offer the pledge in district schools , and then reversed its decision weeks later .	the decision was in response to a new state law that required school districts to offer either the pledge or the national anthem daily .

it assaults us with an awkward mix of humor ( which is rarely funny ) and heart ( which is never touching ) , but even more amateurishly , it features copious cutaways to characters laughing at each others ' jokes .	for long stretches of time , adam sandler and co. sit around a new england lake house goofing on each other , telling stories and reminiscing about old times .	given that these other characters are played by kevin james , chris rock , david spade and rob schneider , you would hope that some of the lines would work ( from james and rock , at least ) .	one gets the distinct impression that these guys , four out of five of whom are " saturday night live " alumni , improvised most of their insults and one-liners , and there just happened to be a camera or two rolling .	( sandler and fred wolf are credited with having written the script . )	but then dennis dugan , director of such ignominious sandler films as " happy gilmore , " '' you do n't mess with the zohan " and " i now pronounce you chuck & larry , " incessantly cuts between them admiring each others ' zingers .	this is not just alienating .	it 's downright uncomfortable .	the plot , which is essentially " the big chill " with jokes about flatulence and bunions , finds five childhood friends reuniting for the funeral of the basketball coach who led them to a championship in 1978 .	lenny ( sandler ) is now a big hollywood agent who 's married to a fashion designer ( salma hayek pinault ) with whom he has obnoxious , spoiled kids .	eric ( james ) is also married with kids ; his wife ( maria bello ) still breast-feeds their 4-year-old son , which is played for the kind of gross-out laughs you would expect .	kurt ( rock ) is the sensitive househusband , married to a workaholic ( maya rudolph ) , with two kids and a stereotypically nitpicky mother-in-law ( ebony jo-ann ) who 's like a caricature of a tyler perry character .	then there 's marcus ( spade ) , who 's single and constantly on the prowl for ladies , and rob ( schneider ) , a new-agey vegan married to a woman old enough to be his mother ( joyce van patten ) .	they all get together for a long weekend where not much happens , aside from pratfalls in the woods , plenty of public urination , and an eventual moment of confession which is nothing short of cringeworthy .	halfway through , hayek 's character blows off her own fashion show in milan , supposedly because she feels so compelled to and take part in the bonding .	the payoff : she gets to watch her husband and his buddies in a rematch against the guys they played more than 30 years ago , even though everyone is now middle-aged and out of shape .	this scene , by the way , provides the only truly funny moment in the whole film , as rock and tim meadows confront each other on the court .	then again , meadows ' arrival is yet another reminder of the depressing waste of talent here .	rock is woefully underused .	rudolph is sadly one-note .	there 's also a bizarre cameo involving steve buscemi in a full-body cast .	it 's enough to make you wonder whether watching all these people having dinner ?	without the guise of making a movie with actual characters and a plot ?	might have been more enjoyable .

when a new cap shut off the flow of oil into the gulf of mexico nearly a month ago , some locals read it as a period rather than a comma in the saga .	now , with bp plc and federal officials pondering whether the final plug , or " bottom kill , " is even necessary , those officials fear national disengagement from what remains a crisis of unknown proportions . "	this is going to be a long-term situation , " jefferson parish council chairman john young said . "	i think it 's way too early for the federal government have a ' mission accomplished ' type of attitude . "	work on the final kill to the well has been postponed by bad weather blowing through the region .	crews drilling relief wells to the gusher have stopped their work , and will need about four days to finish once the weather passes , retired coast guard adm. thad allen said wednesday .	allen , the administration 's point man on the spill , said the well may not need to have heavy mud and cement pumped into it from deep underground after all .	he said testing still needs to be done on the well before a final decision is made .	bp and the federal government will check to see whether the cement pumped in through the top went down into the reservoir , came back up and plugged the space between the inner piping and the outer casing .	if so , the bottom kill might not be necessary . "	we think it 's a low probability event , but we ca n't rule it out , " allen said .	allen also hopes he may be able to step down from his post by late september or early october , handing off the responsibility .	allen , who has served in the role since may 1 , said he 'll only do that if the well is definitively shown to be in no danger of leaking again .	the discussion of a possible departure , though , raised the ire of some officials who say washington is too eager to turn the page on the spill . "	are they planning on closing up shop ?	absolutely .	am i sad thad allen is going to be gone ?	absolutely not , " said plaquemines parish president billy nungesser , who has criticized much of the government 's response as lacking a sense of urgency .	but allen 's departure , whenever it comes , may simply signal that the response has entered a new phase , going from crisis response to long-term recovery , jefferson parish councilman chris roberts said . "	despite some of the unforeseen challenges of this event , i never doubted his desire to get the source of oil stopped , " roberts said of allen .	roberts said work is increasingly focused on restoration of wetlands and beaches , and the recovery of the commercial and recreational fishing industries , rather than stopping the flow of oil , which was achieved last month with the cap . "	whether or not this becomes an old story is totally up to the media , " roberts said .	meanwhile , the tropical depression that had threatened to turn into a tropical storm in the gulf fell apart wednesday , a day after crews drilling the final few feet of the relief well halted their work because of concerns about the weather .	allen said wednesday that suspending work at the wellhead while the storm passes will cost crews about 96 hours , meaning work on the bottom kill wo n't be done until at least monday or tuesday .	heavy rain is still forecast for the gulf into thursday and he did not say when the work might resume .	government scientists estimate that almost three-quarters of the oil that spewed after the april 20 explosion of the offshore drilling rig deepwater horizon has already been collected by the temporary containment cap , cleaned up or chemically dispersed , or naturally deteriorated .	also wednesday , u.s. rep. edward markey , a democrat from massachusets , called on bp plc to accept the government 's estimate that 4.9 million barrels , or 206 million gallons , had spilled .	the amount is important because it could help determine what fines bp faces for the spill .	markey sent a letter to the head of bp 's u.s. operations telling him that the oil giant should legally own up to its obligations as one of the responsible parties .	civil penalties can be levied under a variety of environmental protection laws , including fines of up to $ 1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled .	if bp were found to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct , the civil fine could be up to $ 4,300 per barrel .	that means bp could face fines of up to $ 21 billion .
it was a war in iraq that first drew staff sgt. william powell to the army national guard .	and 18 years later , it 's war in iraq that keeps him there .	powell , 51 , was one of 30 army guardsmen who returned to alaska last month after a nine-month deployment to iraq .	it was his third overseas deployment , and second to iraq .	the lifelong fairbanks resident was the only interior guardsmen from f company , 1/207th aviation , which transported cargo , equipment and personnel across kuwait and iraq using c-23 fixed wing aircraft , also known as sherpas .	as a flight engineer , it 's powell 's job to help keep the sherpas flying . "	i love it , " said powell , who figures he has about three years left with the guard . "	it 's something i 'll miss very much when i get out . "	while most guardsmen decide to join out of high school or college , powell came to the guard late , at 33 .	he said he had n't thought much about a military career when he was younger , but he felt a patriotic urge to enlist when the first gulf war broke out . "	back when i was coming out of high school i had n't thought about it much , but when desert storm happened , i thought it was time to join , " he said .	one of the thing that appealed to powell most about the guard , is that it allowed him to continue to work at golden heart utilities , where he has been a pipefitter for 33 years . "	you should think about a career in the guard if you 're not sure you want to be full-time , " he said . "	but you get every benefit of being full-time and the chance to learn a new skill . "	powell , a graduate of lathrop high school , has three deployments under his belt after he returned to alaska last month .	his first deployment , to kosovo in 2004 , was the hardest , but he said each one has gotten a little bit easier , especially as his five children have gotten older .	his youngest is now 21 . "	you need to make sure the car 's running and in good order and anything that needs to be done around the house , make sure it 's done before you 're deployed , " he said . "	fairbanks can get cold and unforgiving . "	powell expects he 'll be deployed one more time before he leaves the guard , though he 's not sure where that might be as the military begins its withdrawal from iraq .	in the meantime , he plans on enjoying an outdoorsman 's life of camping , hunting and fishing in alaska . "	i love alaska and i would n't want to be anywhere else , " he said . "	it 's just such a vast country full of beautiful scenery . "

"	i maintain my innocence .	i have never and nor would i ever violate the public 's trust , " he said , claiming he adhered to the highest standards of conduct while in office and based his actions on the best interests of his constituents and massachusetts residents .	dimasi also took a shot at the recent passage of a state law allowing for casino gambling , noting that he had opposed casinos during his tenure as speaker that ended in january 2009 . "	the irony that the casino culture prevailed after so many years just one week before i traveled to kentucky is certainly not lost on me , " he said .	richard mcdonough , a statehouse lobbyist who was a co-defendant in the case , was also scheduled to report to a federal prison in devens , mass. , on wednesday to begin a seven-year prison sentence .	dimasi and mcdonough had unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to stay their sentences and allow them to remain free on bail while they appeal their convictions .	a three-judge panel of the 1st u.s. circuit court of appeals also denied a stay .	dimasi is seeking to be transferred from the kentucky prison to the facility in devens .	the federal judge had recommended to the bureau of prisons that dimasi be allowed to serve his sentence in massachusetts because he has a history of heart problems and his wife , debbie , is being treated for breast cancer .	the bureau is n't bound by a judge 's recommendation when assigning prisoners .

wet and cool weather that delayed last year 's grape harvest has left winemakers wondering longer than usual about the quality of the vintage .	the st. louis post-dispatch reported that some wineries are weeks behind in the blending and fermentation processes , while others are working with fewer grapes because the weather hurt yields .	and it could still be groundhog day or valentine 's day before winemakers know if they 've had a good year , said chuck dressel , owner of mount pleasant winery in the eastern missouri town of augusta . "	we 're waiting with bated breath , " he said .	winemakers said 2009 separated the inexperienced growers from newcomers who do n't understand the technology . "	it was cool and wet , and they had to monitor the vineyards very carefully .	they had to spray a lot , " said jim anderson , executive director of the missouri wine and grape board . "	the better growers did a really great job .	you had to be a good farmer to keep an eye on everything . "	disease was a major concern this year without heat to dry up moisture .	mark baehmann , winemaker at chaumette vineyards and winery in ste. genevieve , said vineyard workers did a lot of thinning , deliberately keeping yields low , but allowing more light and heat to reach the fruit . "	we had low tonnage this year , " he said . "	i needed every grape i could get . "	but with the region 's variable climate , some vineyards actually experienced some of their best years ever . "	it was a great year for us all around , " said peter hofherr of st. james winery near rolla , the state 's largest winery . "	we had more heat than everybody else ; we 're in a small band .	our reds ripened earlier than everybody else by a couple of weeks . "	although final numbers are n't yet available , anderson expects missouri 's grape growers harvested what has been a typical yield in recent years ?	about 4,200 tons of fruit .	he credits the apparently solid yield to more acreage being put in production than in previous years .	in the past decade , the amount of missouri land devoted to wine-producing grapes has doubled to about 1,500 acres .	the increase coincides with the number of missouri wineries increasing from just over 30 to more than 90 over that same period .

three-year-old carly chandler , the girl who inspired alabama 's first medicinal marijuana law , sits in a specially made rocking chair in front of her family 's christmas tree when her tiny body suddenly jerks .	it 's one of the hundred small seizures she has each day .	the severe grand mal seizures , the ones her parents worry will kill her , mostly happen at night , with a recent one sending her into gasping convulsions for 10 minutes .	in carly 's teal and white bedroom , her father , dustin chandler , said all he could do was bow his head . "	i literally prayed over her bed that she would make it through the seizure , " he said .	families who pushed for alabama 's first medicinal marijuana law hope their children can start trying the potential seizure treatment sometime in early 2015 and hope that it can provide relief where heavy regimens of pharmaceuticals have not . "	carly 's law " funded a university of alabama at birmingham to study the marijuana derivative cannabidiol , or cbd oil , to treat severe seizures .	gov. robert bentley signed the legislation into law nine months ago , but the university had to await federal approval to begin the study .	carly started having seizures at just 8 weeks-old .	she was diagnosed 10 days after her first birthday with cdkl5 , a rare genetic disorder which causes severe neurodevelopmental impairment and is characterized by frequent seizures . "	we worry every day that she could die from what is called sudep , sudden unexplained death in epilepsy , " her mother , amy chandler said . "	the brain literally stops and shuts everything down . "	carly ca n't speak or walk .	she rocks her head side to side when she wants a turn rocking in the infant swing .	like most 3-year-olds , she likes the taste of grilled chicken nuggets , although hers are pureed and spoon fed to her .	she laughs when she gets tickles from daddy and enjoys christmas lights and music .	the chandlers hope that if carly 's brain can just get a rest from the daily onslaught of seizures that maybe she could make some developmental gains , perhaps say a few words . "	her voice would be priceless .	just to hear her talk to us , " amy chandler said .	the chandlers ' fight for the oil came after a cnn special that featured a colorado girl who saw a reduction in her severe seizures , and regained her ability to talk , after taking cbd oil . "	we thought , " why can they have it and we ca n't ?	because they live in a different zip code ? "	amy chandler said .	the oil is an extract from marijuana , but comes from a plant variety with very little tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc , the component that gets a person high .	instead , it is rich in the compound cannabidiol .	the scientific evidence about the oil is limited .	however , the ancedotal accounts from parents were enough to bring scores of parents to colorado , where marijuana is legal for both medicine and recreation , and sparked legislative pushes by parents in statehouses from georgia to utah to make cbd oil available .	dustin chandler , a realtor and pelham police officer , went to montgomery to lobby for the legislation .	the original version of the bill would have given people with seizure disorders a justifiable defense if charged with drug possession over the oil .	it quickly ran into stumbling blocks because of concerns about patient safety and political fears of approving a medicinal marijuana bill in an election year . "	you know this and i know this , it provided the republicans some political cover , " dustin chandler said of using a university study .	however , he said the involvement of university doctors means that dosage and potency are controlled .	both are major pluses for patient safety , he said , in addition to looking for scientific evidence about the oil 's effectiveness . "	i just wish it was a broader bill .	i think we can push for that once we get this started and start letting doctors determine whether this is a valid treatment for these disorders , " dustin chandler said .	the food and drug administration sent uab letters this month greenlighting the two studies , one for children and one for adults .	uab spokesman bob shepard said the fda requested some changes in the protocol and those will go before a review board next month .	unlike studies in which some patients are given placebos , the uab study will provide the oil to all participants .	more than 400 people at one point had expressed interest , he said .	one of them is amy young of wetumpka .	she hopes the oil can help her 3-year-old daughter eleanor , nicknamed " leni . "	who can have a dozen major seizures a day , even on heavy doses of anti-seizure medication . "	we have been on everything .	we have tried everything , " young said . "	i hope and pray , first , that we get into the study and next that she gets some relief , " young said .	leni had a stroke before she was born that destroyed all but about 10 percent of her brain .	still , she was progressing normally as an infant -- laughing , rolling over and reaching -- until the seizures started happening when she was about seven months old .	doctors did n't think she would live and advised hospice .	but the family brought leni home instead , preparing to say good-bye , but hoping for a miracle .	today , leni , like most 3-year-olds , sings along to frozen 's " let it go " but in " her own language . "	she likes looking at a neighbor 's christmas light display , synchronized to the sounds of the same disney film .	but young describes a two steps forward , two steps back existence .	leni will regain a basic baby skill , like rolling over , only to have it wiped out when she has a severe round of seizures .	parents say they realize the oil might not be a miracle cure .	it is hope , where hope has n't existed before . "	we know it 's not a cure for her seizures .	we do n't even know if it will help her seizures .	all we can do is pray that it is going to work for her , " amy chandler said .	her doctors have said that carly will " write her own story " but amy chandler also worries that the seizures , if uncontrolled , could wipe out the abilities she does have .	carly takes physical therapy several times a week to try to build her strength .	on this day , she howls in protest as her physical therapist daphne wallace adjusts a walker that holds carly upright .	protests aside , carly slowly moves one pink sneakered foot forward and then the other . "	she 's stepping more , " wallace says . "	good girl , carly .	i know .	i know , " wallace coos encouragingly .	the walker inches slowly down the hallway .
now that spring is here and the weather is getting warmer , it 's about time for kodiak bears to come out of hibernation .	larry van daele , a biologist with the alaska department of fish and game , told kmxt-fm ( http://bit.ly/h8e40p ) that people have become much smarter in how to prevent attracting bears since he first came to kodiak island 30 years ago .	van daele says once the snow melts it 's time for homeowners to look around the yard and clean up anything that can attract bears , including spilled bird seed and garbage that the dogs may have gotten into .	he also says that when walking in the woods resist the temptation to investigate foul smells or anything that might be dead because a bear might be up to the same thing .

bob hilton calls himself " a great story collector . "	the frederick resident has been a farmer , foundry worker , construction laborer , marine , police officer , insurance agent , private detective , lumberyard manager , newspaper columnist , building contractor and real estate agent .	at 78 , hilton has penned and self-published " all the way home , " which he calls " a 20th-century american love story in black and white and marine green . "	the book is a combination of his own life , as well as the experiences of others , often told with the names changed to protect their anonymity .	it was n't easy to write the book , hilton said , because some of the experiences are painful , even after many years .	hilton grew up in annapolis rock , a small community at the howard and montgomery county line .	he got his first job while attending annapolis rock 's one-room schoolhouse . "	i was in the fifth grade .	we had an old stove .	i got paid 50 cents a month as a ' fireman . '	i would come in a half-hour early and start the fire in the stove .	i shared the job with my cousin david mullinix .	we took turns starting the fire or bringing in the coal for it . "	one morning hilton arrived early at the school to find an inebriated man in the school asleep on the floor .	the man woke up and grabbed hilton , telling him to get the fire going because it was cold . "	i was so frightened i could n't do anything .	then the schoolteacher came in , saw what was going on and began beating the man with a broom .	i grabbed the poker to the stove and started beating him , too , and he soon cleared out of the school . "	after that , hilton said , his mother made him take their dog with him for protection . "	when i got to school and it was safe , i just told the dog to go home , and he would . "	after graduating from lisbon high school at the age of 16 , hilton worked at frederick iron and steel and then in construction .	he joined the marines in 1951 . "	i do n't really feel i did anything , many did so much more , " he said of those who fought in the korean war .	one of his strongest memories is the last day of the war .	he was trying to get machine guns and ammunition to a group of marines getting hit by artillery fire . "	i could n't get to them .	the line to them was blocked .	there was artillery barrages from both sides .	then at 10 p.m. ( july 27 , 1953 ) , flares went up and everything stopped .	it was total silence .	the war had ended . "	returning to civilian life , hilton was a " repo man , " taking back vehicles when the owners were delinquent in payment ; then he was an insurance agent and joined the montgomery county police department in 1958 . "	i solved one murder in a few minutes .	i came to a scene with a dead man , killed with an ax that was still there .	i asked a child standing there if he knew whose ax it was .	he told me whose it was , the guy was standing nearby .	i asked him if he killed the man , he said ' yes , ' and i arrested him . "	hilton then moved to michigan , where he had a pig farm and was a police officer in kalamazoo .	he left the police force to do sales at a lumberyard in battle creek , eventually becoming manager of the business .	asked why he changed careers so much , hilton said he just got bored .	he moved back to maryland in 1968 and went to work for a home-building company and in 1977 started his own firm , custom home design . "	i never built more than eight houses in a year , but they were all from the drawing board custom .	and they are still standing . "	at that time , builders could go to the county permits office , pay $ 6 and build without an inspection , hilton said .	he was active with the frederick county builders association , serving a term as president and often at odds with county commissioners over what he saw as too much regulation on private land .	hilton holds a " spike " designation for recruiting more than 200 people into the building association .	he also wrote the " builders ' block , " an opinion column for the frederick news-post . "	i was trying to keep frederick for the small builders , let them control how growth would go .	instead , it was opened to the big builders and small builders have been pushed out over the years , " hilton said . "	experiences are like a collection of pieces of cloth that make up a quilt .	the pieces together can make something beautiful . "

synthetic marijuana has sent 160 people to hospitals in new york state in a little over a week , a spike that prompted authorities to warn friday that the drug is dangerous and illegal .	over 120 emergency-room visits since april 8 linked to synthetic pot ?	known by " spice , " '' k2 , " '' green giant " and other street names ?	have been in new york city , its health department said friday .	the average earlier this year was two to three synthetic marijuana-related emergency room visits per day citywide .	statewide , poison control center calls stemming from synthetic marijuana also have risen dramatically , gov. andrew cuomo 's office said . "	synthetic drugs are anything but harmless , and this rash of severe health emergencies across the state is direct proof , " he said in a statement .	other states also have expressed concern .	alabama public health officials said wednesday that nearly 100 people had been hospitalized for problems linked to synthetic marijuana within the past month .	police in hampton , virginia , said one person died and two others were hospitalized after synthetic marijuana overdoses last weekend .	in february , over 40 state attorneys general signed a letter asking oil companies to make sure gas station convenience stores do n't sell synthetic drugs .	in new york city , the health department is issuing reminders to stores that it 's illegal to sell synthetic marijuana .	synthetic marijuana generally consists of dried vegetation coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of pot .	some users report that it produces a marijuana-like high , but others experience extreme anxiety , hallucinations , a rapid heart rate , vomiting and other symptoms , the federal national institute on drug abuse says .	the federal substance abuse and mental health services administration estimates over 28,500 people went to emergency rooms nationwide in 2011 after taking the drug , a fraction of the visits linked to actual marijuana , heroin or cocaine . "	there 's no way of knowing exactly what synthetic marijuana contains , " making its effects unpredictable , new york city health commissioner dr. mary bassett said .	she issued a similar warning last summer after 15 people went to e.r.s with bad reactions to the drug in four days .	while the drug 's users often are teens and young adults , the median age is 35 in the recent cases in the city , the health department said .	since 2012 , new york state regulations have banned selling or possessing various chemicals used to make synthetic marijuana .	store owners and employees can be charged with a crime for selling it .

vogue magazine , perhaps the world 's top arbiter of style , is making a statement about its own models : too young and too thin is no longer in .	the 19 editors of vogue magazines around the world made a pact to project the image of healthy models , according to a conde nast international announcement thursday .	they agreed to " not knowingly work with models under the age of 16 or who appear to have an eating disorder , " and said they will ask casting directors to check ids at photo shoots and fashion shows and for ad campaigns .	the move is an important one for the fashion world , said former model sara ziff , who was discovered at 14 and has since founded the model alliance , dedicated to improving the working conditions of models and persuading the industry to take better care of its young . "	most editions of vogue regularly hire models who are minors , so for vogue to commit to no longer using models under the age of 16 marks an evolution in the industry , " she said . "	we hope other magazines and fashion brands will follow vogue 's impressive lead . "	american , french , chinese and british editions of the fashion glossies are among those that will start following the new guidelines with their june issues ; the japanese edition will begin with its july book . "	vogue believes that good health is beautiful .	vogue editors around the world want the magazines to reflect their commitment to the health of the models who appear on the pages and the well-being of their readers , " said conde nast international chairman jonathan newhouse in a statement .	models ' health ?	and especially their weight ?	has been a lightning rod the past few years , especially after the death of two models from apparent complications from eating disorders in 2006-07 , but the focus , until now , has been on runway fashion shows .	the council of fashion designers of america adopted a voluntary initiative in 2007 , which emphasizes age minimums and healthy working environments during new york fashion week , and london fashion week designers sign a contract with the british fashion council to use models who are at least 16 .	the primary fashion organizations in italy and spain banned catwalk models who fall below a certain body mass index level , and earlier this year , israel 's government passed an anti-skinny-model law .	still , there is persistent criticism that the fashion world creates a largely unattainable and unhealthy standard that particularly affects impressionable young girls . "	we know that there is an impact for young girls ?	and boys , by the way ?	of what is put in front of them in terms of media , " said elissa j. brown , professor of psychology at st. john university and founder of the partners program , a specialized therapy program for children and adolescents .	a change in what they see on the pages of prestigious fashion magazines could change the image of what they would strive for , she said .	it would n't hurt for parents to take a look at healthier looking models , too , she added . "	i 'm a mother and i hear other mothers talk about the parts of their bodies they do n't like in front of their daughters instead of talking about health .	if the message becomes about health , it could have a tremendous impact . "	the vogue guidelines are largely similar to the cfda 's ?	no surprise since u.s. editor-in-chief anna wintour was instrumental in crafting them . "	cfda is pleased to see all the vogue magazines unite in support of model health , " cfda ceo steven kolb said . "	this increased level of support makes the message of ' health is beauty ' even stronger . "	conde nast , in its announcement , recognized that fashion models serve as role models for " many women , " and the publisher wants to ensure that the models in its pages " are well cared for and educated in ways that will encourage and help them to take care of themselves , addressing as many of the pressing issues relating to ill-health in the industry as can realistically be tackled . "	ziff said the age restriction is important for other reasons , too . "	the use of underaged models is linked to financial exploitation , eating disorders , interrupted schooling , and contributes to models ' overall lack of empowerment in the workplace , " she said . "	we simply believe that 14 is too young to be working in this very grown-up industry , and we 're glad that cond ?	nast international is making this commitment .	in addition to agreeing not to knowingly work with models under 16 or with eating disorders , the vogue pact says the magazines will help " structure mentoring programs " for younger models and raise awareness of the problem of model health .	the magazines said they would encourage healthy working conditions backstage and encourage designers " to consider the consequences of unrealistically small sample sizes of their clothing , which limits the range of women who can be photographed in their clothes , and encourages the use of extremely thin models . "	conde nast publishes other magazines , including glamour and allure , but a spokeswoman said there are no current plans for these guidelines to be adopted across the company .	runway model coco rocha applauded the changes . "	i 've long been a vocal supporter of setting reasonable standards in the modeling industry , " she said in an email . ?

like the last crumbling outpost of a lost civilization , the ski-hi drive-in theater stands at the junction of two highways just north of muncie .	the remnants of the screen tower where countless comedies and horror flicks played out is dotted with gaping holes .	most of the letters making up the name of the theater have long since fallen from the front of the tower facing ind. 3 and 28 .	the concession stand and projection booth have been vandalized and marred by graffiti .	but could the ski-hi ?	scene of so many fictional vampires and zombies scrambling out of the grave onscreen ?	come back to life ?	michael chalfant is n't opposed to the idea .	chalfant , a muncie businessman , bought the 20-acre theater property two years ago on a whim .	chalfant lives in the far reaches of northern delaware county and drove past one day and noticed a " for sale " sign . "	i pulled over and gave them a call and got a price , " chalfant told the star press ( http://tspne.ws/1723ph2 ) . "	i talked to my wife and said , ' we need to buy it and see what we can do with it . ' "	but what exactly to do with the drive-in has become something of a quandary for chalfant .	initially he thought about bulldozing the remaining structures and trying to develop the property at the busy intersection .	bev brand is hoping chalfant does n't take that step .	brand ?	whose family 's business , brand sheet metal works , built the ski-hi 's screen tower in the early 1950s ?	wants to see the ski-hi rehabbed and revived . "	it 's a family thing , " the muncie woman said , explaining that her interest in the ski-hi goes beyond the sheet metal company 's involvement in erecting the screen more than 60 years ago . "	people went there when they were kids and they want to be able to take their kids there . "	around indiana and the united states , a handful of drive-in theaters survive .	the resurrection of the ski-hi ?	if it happened ?	would be a big reversal to a trend that 's been ongoing for 30 years .	after their birth in camden , new jersey , in 1933 , drive-in theaters quickly spread across the country .	america 's car culture and the rise of entertainment to appeal to teenagers helped fuel the drive-in age .	by the end of the 1950s , more than 4,000 drive-ins were entertaining moviegoers .	among those was the ski-hi , built in 1952 .	the ski-hi and the muncie drive-in , on kilgore avenue , attracted hundreds of cars each weekend .	the muncie , on kilgore avenue , closed in the 1980s .	but the ski-hi survived the twin threats that killed most of the nation 's drive-ins : the home video revolution and an increase in the value of drive-in property for other development .	a handful of east central indiana drive-in theaters remain among some of the 600 or so left around the country , according to usa today .	the ski-hi hung in there until 2005 , when kerasotes theaters ?	at the time the owner of all of muncie 's indoor theaters ?	decided against reopening it .	chalfant brought the property from amc , the company that had purchased local theaters from kerasotes .	almost immediately , chalfant discovered how much of an attraction the drive-in remains . "	you 'd be surprised at how many people stop by when i 'm mowing , " he said .	the curious and well-wishers include past managers and , of course , many patrons .	there 's a deep affection for the ski-hi among those who used to attend movies there .	while star press staffers were at the ski-hi , marcia zigler pulled her pickup truck into the drive-in 's entrance .	zigler acknowledged she 's been a lifelong fan of the theater and hopes something happens to revive it . "	i have a set of speakers from the ski-hi , " zigler said , adding that she happened upon the drive-in when the speakers and posts were being removed years ago and asked for a pair .	chalfant ?	who said he bought the ski-hi for $ 65,000 ?	has tried to maintain the property , although the weather and vandals have taken a toll .	trespassers have broken into not only the apartment at the base of the tower but the concession stand . "	everything 's pretty well gone , " he said . "	thieves have taken the scrap and the wiring .	the snack bar is beyond repair .	the counters are still in there but it 's pretty much been rummaged through . "	local building inspectors have contacted chalfant about the deterioration of the property , although he said he believes he 's addressed their concerns at least in part by keeping the property mowed .	brand said she 's talked to chalfant several times about the property , noting that brand sheet metal works would like a chance to restore the screen tower it built more than 60 years ago .	she said she 'd like to organize a group to explore the possible revitalization of the theater .	chalfant said it would take more funds than he can commit to the project . "	i do n't even know the first thing about it , " chalfant said . "	i would n't know where to begin .	it could take $ 300,000 to $ 500,0000 to do it .	we 're going to keep it mowed , but we ca n't do anything with the structure .	maybe a nonprofit organization would do it . "	in the meantime , chalfant said , " i have no immediate plans to demolish it . "

as netflix and other video services offer thousands of movies streamed over the internet , all those choices are creating a dilemma : what to watch next .	a 2-year-old movie recommendation website called clerkdogs is addressing the problem by offering online chats with former video store clerks , film critics and other movie buffs .	the chat option is scheduled to debut at 7 p.m. et thursday , just as some subscribers to netflix inc.

florida officials are violating federal law by unnecessarily warehousing hundreds of children with disabilities and even babies in nursing homes , often for years , federal investigators told the state in a letter this week .	after visiting 200 children in six florida nursing homes , u.s. department of justice officials warned in a letter to attorney general pam bondi that the state is violating the federal americans with disabilities act by unnecessarily institutionalizing children .	the letter also said florida is violating their civil rights by segregating and isolating them in hospitals .	the average length of stay is three years , according to the letter .	many of them have few interactions with others , rarely leaving the facilities , and are not exposed to social , educational and recreational activities " that are critical to child development , " the letter said .	educational opportunities are limited to as little as 45 minutes a day .	the federal government began investigating last year after being contacted by child advocates in south florida who grew frustrated when state officials failed to make changes after a nearly two-year fight .	advocates said the state is relying on cheaper nursing home care instead of providing services to care for them at home .	the justice department in january asked bondi 's office for data and documents , but despite numerous requests bondi 's office refused to give any information voluntarily , according to the letter .	bondi 's office did not immediately respond to email and phone call requests for comment thursday .	florida 's agency for health care administration said the letter was sent tuesday .	the associated press obtained a copy thursday .	the state agency said it is impossible to formally rebut the letter 's findings yet because they have n't seen the documents the letters is based on .	the state also contends it is providing " medically necessary " care and will likely deny any wrongdoing if it decides to take legal action , according to a statement .	the agency said the complaint mirrors an ongoing class action lawsuit pending in federal court in miami .	the letter gives the state 10 days to respond .	if the state does not comply voluntarily , then the u.s. attorney general may initiate a lawsuit under the federal disability act .	federal investigators identified numerous children who did n't need to be in nursing homes and " would benefit from moving home with their families or other community settings , " according to the letter .	the state fails to look for other placement for children in nursing homes and offers no realistic discharge or transition planning , often leaving children in these facilities for years , according to the letter . "	the kids are all medicaid recipients so they could go in at any age and come out at death because they 're covered by medicaid dollars , " said marjorie evans , who runs broward children 's center , a nonprofit that cares for disabled children and adults .	federal officials concluded the state has made it difficult for children to get medical services that would allow them to move home by making drastic cuts to programs that help disabled children and adults .	that has led to a yearlong waiting list for services .	at the same time , state policies expanded nursing home care by offering facilities an enhanced daily rate for caring for children , according to the letter .	many family members who are still able to care for their disabled children at home have said the state has denied or reduced the number of hours it will pay for an in-home nurse , making it nearly impossible for parents to continue caring for their children at home .	one mother said her 3-year-old daughter who has down syndrome has been in a facility since she was a baby .	the girl requires intensive help so she can eat and breathe .	the mother told federal investigators she wants to care for her daughter at home full time , but the state will only pay for enough home care on certain weekends , according to the letter .	many of the children have been injured in car accidents or near-drowning 's and have physical disabilities , but remember what life was like before their accident . "	they get very depressed " and need psychological services , said evans , who was among the advocates that contacted federal officials .	federal officials visited nursing homes in miami , tampa and orlando , where children live in cold , hospital like settings , rarely leaving the facility , wearing identification bands as they watch tv in a common area or just sit in bed .	at one facility , a common room contained children 's toys along with a sitting area for elderly residents .	brian lee , executive director of families for better care , an advocacy group for nursing home residents , said the doj report brought him to tears , and pointed to the failures of gov. rick scott and the legislature to appropriately fund non-institutionalized care programs . "	can you imagine the quality of life as a child living in a nursing home ? "	asked lee , who was previously the state nursing home ombudsman . "	literally no one to play with ?	it 's heartbreaking . "	he said he hoped the report spurred major change in the system . "	is this just going to be a report that 's just going to be a slap on the wrist for florida ? "	he asked . "	i 'm hoping gov. scott and the legislature have compassion for children , have compassion for nursing home residents and that they 'll actually step up and do something right .

fifteen-year-old audrie pott passed out drunk at a friend 's house , woke up and concluded she had been sexually abused .	in the days that followed , she was shocked to see an explicit photo of herself circulating among her classmates along with emails and text messages about the episode .	and she was horrified to discover that her attackers were three of her friends , her family 's lawyer says .	eight days after the party , she hanged herself .

"	we are talking about a systematic distributing of a photo involving an intimate body part of hers , " allard said .	he said distributing the photo was " equally insidious as the assault . "	she also discovered that her attackers were three boys she considered friends ?	young men in whom she had confided , the lawyer said .	on facebook , audrie said the whole school knew what happened , and she complained that her life was ruined ? "	worst day ever , " allard said .	her parents did not learn about the assault until after her death , when audrie 's friends approached them , allard said .	family members also believe the attackers tried to destroy evidence .	that claim was posted on a facebook page for a foundation set up in the girl 's name .	it did n't provide further details on what type of evidence might have been targeted by the suspects .	however , it asked any students with information to come forward .	in canada , meanwhile , police said friday they have received new information and are reopening their investigation in the case of 17-year-old suicide victim rehtaeh parsons .	parsons was photographed while being sexually assaulted in 2011 and was then bullied after the photo was shared on the web , authorities said .	police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone .	in steubenville , ohio , two high school football players were convicted last month of raping a drunken 16-year-old girl in a crime that was recorded on cellphones by students and gossiped about online .	the victim herself realized she had been attacked after seeing text messages , a photo of herself naked and a video that mocked her .	the suspects in the saratoga case were booked into juvenile hall .	their names were not released .	the news surprised residents of the town . "	people in this town are involved , parents advocate for their kids to get the best education , the best teachers , the best sports , " said jamie perez , who was walking her baby and her dog on friday past a coffee shop .	perez graduated from the local school system , which has one of the top high schools in the state .	family videos of audrie show a bright , cheerful girl standing on a cantering horse , boogie boarding at the beach , playing her violin and singing .	interviewed for her high school newspaper saratoga falcon when she started as a freshman in 2011 , audrie was optimistic and said she was looking forward to playing on the soccer team .

"	however , i 'm not looking forward to all the extra homework .	another thing i 'm really excited about is that in high school , the dances seem so much more fun . "	allard said thursday 's arrests " reopened a wound " for the girl 's family members , and they have gone into seclusion .	but they want to see the boys prosecuted as adults and action taken again those who passed the photo around .

"	the plea agreement says chase sold azano $ 9 million in cars from 2010 to 2013 , as well as watches and artwork .	azano , who heads a conglomerate of construction and security companies based in guadalajara , mexico , and specializes in selling eavesdropping equipment to governments , is accused of secretly channeling donations to support four candidates for mayor and congress in 2012 and 2013 .	prosecutors contend he sought to develop san diego 's downtown waterfront .	no candidates had been named in court documents until thursday 's plea agreement produced the check to the committee backing filner , 71 , who resigned as mayor after less than nine months in office amid a flurry of sexual harassment allegations .	he was sentenced to three months of home confinement .	there is no indication that filner knew about the donation to the independent committee .	his attorney , jerry coughlan , did not immediately respond to a request for comment thursday .	according to the plea agreement , an azano employee gave chase about $ 10,000 in cash around late 2011 to support a candidate .	chase got a stack of envelopes and instructions from azano to find straw donors to sidestep a $ 500 cap on individual donations .	azano wrote the $ 380,000 check to chase 's symbolic motor car co. on oct. 2 , 2012 , according to the plea agreement .	one of chase 's companies , south beach acquisitions , wrote a $ 120,000 check to the pro-filner committee on sept. 28 , 2012 .	last month , ernesto encinas , a retired san diego police detective , pleaded guilty to federal counts of conspiracy to commit crimes against the united states and filing a false tax return .	he is a central figure in the scandal for his role as head of the security detail for azano .	two other defendants , washington political consultant ravneet singh and san diego lobbyist marco polo cortes , have pleaded not guilty .

republican gov. chris christie , whose office is being investigated by legislative committees exploring the role that politics played in traffic jams last fall , must figure out how to address the scandal when he gives his state of the state address tuesday .	christie 's administration has not revealed what he plans to say , but he will have a larger audience and announcements about tax cut plans will no longer be the most anticipated part .	the same could be true at the governor 's inauguration for a second term next week , set to take place on ellis island , historically a gateway to the u.s. for millions of immigrants .	the setting is meant to showcase christie 's inclusiveness and ability to appeal to a broad swath of voters .	the intensifying investigation , which threatens to undermine christie 's second term and his chances at a 2016 presidential run , revealed last week that high-ranking christie aides and appointees were involved in closing lanes on the bridge linking new jersey to new york city as apparent political payback that led to massive gridlock in the town of fort lee .	christie , a rising star in the republican party , has apologized over the lane closings but denied involvement .	he also fired a top aide and cut ties with a political adviser who 'd been widely seen as a potential campaign manager if christie runs for president .	a new special assembly committee will be charged with finding out how high the plot went up christie 's chain of command , said a leading state democrat , assembly majority leader lou greenwald . "	it is clearly an abuse of power , " he said . "	the question is , who abused their power and how high did it go ? "	the scandal widened last week when documents were released showing that , in addition to the apparent political retribution by christie 's team , the mayor of fort lee asked christie 's top deputy at the transit agency whether the lane closings were a punishment for him and why .	the mayor , democrat mark sokolich , had noted that he did n't endorse christie for re-election but told cnn last week that he could n't recall " a specific request to endorse " from the governor 's campaign staff .	sokolich shifted away from that assertion monday , saying in an interview at his law office that he did consider a request from the christie campaign but ended up supporting the democratic candidate .	he declined to say why he changed his account or answer other questions about his interaction with the campaign .

a restoration project has turned up hundreds of young steelhead and other fish in ashland creek in southern oregon , showing that years of restoration efforts are paying off , biologists say .	also in the count were coho salmon , pacific giant salamanders and the bottom-feeding sculpin .	they were recovered while a 300-foot section of the creek was drained for habitat improvement work that included removing a century-old irrigation dam , the ashland daily tidings reported ( http://bit.ly/om1br5 ) .	state fish biologist dan vandyke said the key is " native fish are using ashland creek despite numerous challenges . "	the creek runs through downtown ashland and its lithia park .	it comes off the highest point in the watershed and is a primary source of cold , clear water for bear creek , a tributary of the rogue river .	among the steps to improve the stream taken in recent decades was the removal of three dams in the 1990s from lithia park , where large steelhead can now be seen swimming .	earlier this month , crews finished reconstructing parts of the channel , and removing the irrigation dam , said scott english , principal restoration biologist for northwest biological consulting , the ashland contractor doing the city project , which is expected to cost nearly $ 250,000 .	after removing several tons of sediment that backed up in the stream channel above the dam , crews built a half-dozen horseshoe-shaped barriers made of river rock and root wads to improve the stream 's capacity and fish habitat .	work is to resume later this fall , after rains come , when crews will replant the banks with native trees and shrubs .	among ashland creek 's challenges , said vandyke , are several diversions that take water from the creek and have concrete barriers to fish passage .	the stream also gets surface runoff from storm drains and is used to flush effluent from the city water treatment plant .	it frequently becomes contaminated with e. coli bacteria in the summer , and it 's also the source of the city 's drinking water and some hydroelectric power .

the current ebola crisis in west africa is on pace to sicken more people than all other previous outbreaks of the disease combined , the health official leading the u.s. response said thursday .	the next few weeks will be critical , said dr. tom frieden , director of the centers for disease control and prevention , which is sending more workers into the affected countries to help . "	it will be a long and hard fight , " frieden told a congressional committee thursday .	in his prepared testimony , he estimated it would take at least three to six months to end the outbreak , under what he called a best-case scenario .	frieden said the outbreak , which began in march , is unprecedented in part because it 's in a region of africa that never has dealt with ebola before and has particularly weak health systems .	he said the outbreak 's two main drivers are lack of infection control as both health workers and families care for the sick and risky burial practices .	more than 1,700 people have been sickened in the current outbreak , in guinea , liberia , sierra leone and nigeria .	nearly 1,000 have died , according to the world health organization , or who .	on thursday frieden said there 's no way to know exactly how accurate that count is , or whether some cases are going unreported . "	the data coming out is kind of a fog-of-war situation , " he said .	a medical charity told the house foreign affairs subcommittee that the world was too slow to react to the crisis , until recent headlines about two american aid workers who became infected in liberia and were flown to the u.s. for care . "	ebola is out of control in west africa , and we are starting to see panic now around the world , " said ken isaacs , vice president at samaritan 's purse .	the two american aid workers , who were flown to emory university hospital in atlanta , " seem to get a little better every day , " isaacs said .	frieden did n't rule out the possibility that a traveler could arrive in the u.s. unknowingly infected with ebola .	but he said he is confident there will not be a large ebola outbreak here .	the cdc has put hospitals on alert for symptoms and to check whether people are recent travelers so that they can promptly isolate any suspected cases until proper testing can be done .	frieden said it is possible to stop the outbreak in west africa using tried-and-true public health measures : find and isolate all possible patients , track down everyone they could have exposed , educate the public about risks and ensure health workers follow proper infection control .	the virus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick .	any case missed or exposed person lost to follow-up could keep the outbreak going . "	if you leave behind even a single burning ember , it 's like a forest fire , " he said . "	it flares back up . "	isaacs of samaritan 's purse said that a huge problem will be persuading african communities to abandon the traditional practice of washing the body and kissing the corpse immediately after death , when the body is most infectious .	he said aid workers have been attacked when trying to intervene , and that some physicians in liberia even mocked the existence of the ebola virus , shunning protection around patients .	the state department said thursday night it was ordering all eligible family members of u.s. personnel to leave the american embassy in monrovia , liberia 's capital , because of the ebola outbreak .	the department 's medical office determined that there was a lack of options for routine health care services at major medical facilities due to the outbreak , a spokeswoman said .	liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf declared a national state of emergency this week , and officials said thursday that no one with a fever would be allowed in or out of the country .	in the capital , there were reports of bodies abandoned in the streets .	relatives have been hiding feverish patients at home for fear that if they are brought to isolation centers and do n't have ebola , they will catch it .	troops were deployed there and in sierra leone to stem movement of possibly infected people .	according to the who , liberia and sierra leone account for more than 60 percent of the deaths so far .	on thursday , frieden said guinea was furthest along in responding to the outbreak although it is still spread there .	the world bank group on monday pledged as much as $ 200 million in emergency funding to fight the outbreak , including paying for urgently needed medical supplies , medical staff salaries and lab networks .	on thursday , the u.s. agency for international development said it was sending tens of thousands of protective suits for health care workers .	at least one of the affected countries , nigeria , has requested access to the experimental drug zmapp , used on the two american aid workers .	u.s. health officials have stressed that only extremely limited doses exist , the drug has n't ever been tested in people and there 's no proof it helped the two americans .	they have said it would take several months to make enough even for a small study . "	the plain fact is that we do n't know whether that treatment is helpful , harmful or does n't have any impact , " frieden told the congressional subcommittee .	he added , " i do n't want any false hopes out there . "

gov. peter shumlin said wednesday a new public-private partnership has raised $ 800,000 to help move the state closer to his goal of 100 percent of preschoolers getting access to quality early-childhood education . "	there is no question that quality pre-k programs give kids the best start possible , ensuring they arrive at school ready to learn , " shumlin said at heartworks , a williston preschool packed with adults and children for his announcement .	strong preschool programs lead to better future outcomes , ranging from more high-school graduates going to college to fewer dropping out or ending up in jail , he said .	the funding is expected to help a dozen communities launch public preschool programs for 3 - and 4-year-olds and help pay for them in the first two years , with money after that coming from the state education fund , which provides state aid to local school districts .	of the $ 800,000 , half is coming from the agency of education budget , shumlin said .	the rest is coming from the vermont community preschool collaborative , which raises money from foundations and other private sources .	the effort comes well short of that envisioned in a bill that died in the waning days of this year 's legislative session .	that bill called for making preschool for 3 - and 4-year-olds mandatory .	new state funding would have been about $ 1.2 million in 2015 had the bill passed , said rep. sarah buxton , d-tunbridge , a member of the house education committee and a main backer of the bill .	that was projected to grow to $ 9.1 million in the 10th year of the program .	shumlin had called for a bigger expansion of child care subsidies by using money he wanted to cut from a program that uses a state earned income tax credit to provide cash benefits to low-income working residents .	shumlin 's fellow democrats in the legislature rejected that approach , arguing it amounted to cutting one program designed to help low-income residents to strengthen another .	shumlin spokeswoman susan allen emailed a follow-up statement wednesday afternoon , saying the governor supports the bill backed by buxton and sen. kevin mullin , r-rutland , which is known as the universal pre-k bill .	shumlin " looks forward to discussions about details , costs and funding sources , " allen wrote .

a longshot effort to recall republican gov. rick snyder cleared a hurdle friday and can begin collecting signatures aimed at getting the measure on the ballot , unless the governor files an appeal .	the washtenaw county board of election commissioners voted 2-1 the petition language , which says snyder should be recalled for supporting sweeping new powers for emergency managers , including the ability to void labor agreements .	it also cites snyder 's support for increasing taxes on retirees and low-income workers while substantially cutting business taxes .	the state house passed a package of bills thursday cutting business taxes by $ 1.7 billion by 2013 while raising taxes on retirement income by $ 300 million and doing away with the $ 354 million earned income tax credit for low-income working families in the budget year that starts oct. 1 .	michigan citizens united , a volunteer , non-partisan effort , must collect 806,522 valid signatures to qualify for the november ballot , a quarter of the number cast in the 2010 election , which snyder won with 58 percent of the vote .	lansing attorney john pirich , who represented the governor 's office at friday 's hearing in ann arbor , said he does n't know yet if the governor will appeal .	a call requesting comment from snyder spokeswoman sara wurfel friday morning was not immediately returned .	when michigan citizens united filed its recall petition last week , wurfel said the governor remains focused on policies he says will help put michigan on solid footing for the future . "	he knew full well going into this that it was certainly not going to be easy or a popularity contest , " she said .	but tim kramer , a resident of oakland county 's waterford township and spokesman for michigan citizens united , said he thinks many residents are angry enough at snyder to back the recall .	thousands of protesters have shown up at the capitol in recent months to protest the emergency manager law , taxes on retirement income and measures that would reduce collective bargaining rights .	petitions ca n't be filed until july 1 , since state law forbids a recall petition from being filed until the elected official has been in office for at least six months .	the signatures must be filed no later than aug. 5 to make the november ballot .	an effort to recall snyder 's predecessor , democratic gov. jennifer granholm , fizzled in 2009 .	a 1983 effort to recall democratic gov. james blanchard after he pushed through an income tax increase to deal with the budget deficit also failed to get on the ballot after supporters could n't collect enough signatures .	nationally , only two governors have ever been recalled ?	california gov. gray davis in 2003 and north dakota gov. lynn frazier in 1921 .
the race for wisconsin 's lone open congressional seat pits one of the state 's most outspoken conservative lawmakers against a lesser-known moderate democrat in a district represented by republicans for more than 40 years .	republican state sen. glenn grothman is the favorite to replace tom petri , a moderate who has held the seat since 1979 but decided to retire amid an ethics investigation and rumors of a challenge by grothman .	after winning a tough , four-way primary that included two other state lawmakers , grothman now faces winnebago county executive mark harris , a democrat known for diving deep into policy and attention to detail .	grothman , who made a name for himself in the legislature with outspoken attacks on affirmative action , abortion and welfare benefits , emphasized his conservative credentials and ties to republican gov. scott walker during the primary .	he has noted frequently that he wrote or served as the lead sponsor in the senate on 60 bills signed by walker ?	more than any other state senator .	but with partisanship frequently blamed for the gridlock that has plagued congress , grothman went out of his way during a september debate in fond du lac to note that 51 of those bills passed with bipartisan support . "	while a lot of my accomplishments are on the conservative side of the aisle , sometimes i take pride in the fact that i 'm able to get things done working with the democrats , sometimes even against my republican colleagues , " grothman said . "	an example of that was fighting the predatory loan industry , working with the democrats to make sure they did not get a toehold in this state . "	grothman opposed walker 's proposal to ease regulations on rent-to-own businesses , voted against a gop proposal to allow auto titles to be used to secure loans , and proposed limits on interest rates for payday loans .	grothman and harris both have law degrees and similar backgrounds in accounting .	harris has described himself as a fiscal conservative who proposed balanced budgets and cut spending and debt as county executive .	he has two key disadvantages in the race .	with the exception of john race , who served one term in the 1960s before he was voted out , no democrat has represented the 6th district since 1939 .	grothman also has raised more than three times the amount of money as harris , although grothman spent much of the money to win the gop primary .	as of sept. 30 , both had about $ 140,000 on hand , according to campaign finance records .	both candidates said that improving the economy and creating jobs would be their top priorities , if elected , but grothman also said he would work to reduce welfare benefits .	to create economic growth , grothman would cut corporate income taxes and reduce regulations on businesses .	harris would focus on helping small companies and startups get investment capital to grow .	harris told voters in fond du lac that he thought he was a better fit for the district . "	i think tom petri , who was re-elected so many times , was re-elected because he was a thoughtful , quiet , moderate man , and i feel that i fit that pattern much more than my opponent , " he said .	but grothman said he was n't concerned about his fiery reputation . "	i 'm not afraid of controversy , " he said , " and i think the reason this country is a mess right now is that we have too many politicians in washington who are afraid of controversy . "

a death-row inmate convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two sons in 1993 could have been exonerated by dna evidence had it been stored properly by texas investigators , an expert witness for the defense told a judge monday .	julie heinig , assistant director of a private ohio dna lab , was among the forensic and dna experts who testified during a hearing for hank skinner , whose attorneys are trying to spare him the death penalty .	skinner was convicted of capital murder two years after twila jean busby and her adult sons , elwin caler and randy busby , were found dead in their pampa home .	prosecutors said skinner used an ax handle to kill his 40-year-old girlfriend and stabbed her sons , who were both mentally impaired , on new year 's eve 1993 .	heinig , who was hired as an expert by the defense , testified that she reviewed dna evidence recovered from the house and found them not sufficiently trustworthy to send an inmate to the texas death chamber .	she said it had degraded because it was stored in plastic bags in an environment where temperatures were n't properly controlled .	defense attorneys contend that more sophisticated dna test results collected by an independent lab raise doubts about skinner 's guilt " too weighty " to allow his execution .	attorneys for the state say the dna confirms skinner 's guilt .	the hearing is being held to hear arguments on whether to vacate skinner 's death sentence .	the hearing is expected to conclude on tuesday , after which both sides will submit written arguments to the judge .	it 's unclear when a ruling could be made .	the texas attorney general 's office in november 2012 argued that new testing on 40 items " does not support skinner 's claim that an alternative suspect is the real killer .

for the most part , it 's been no problem for bureau of land management officials to trap wild horses in the pryor mountains this summer .	all they have to do is spread out a little horse kibble ?	hay , pellets and mineral licks ?	and wait for the horses to follow the trail of food into steel corrals .	then the gate is shut behind them . "	we 'd be done in the first three days if we just took the first 40 horses that came in , " said jim sparks , manager of the blm 's billings field office .	but the blm does n't want to cull just any horses from the 175 mares , studs and yearlings that roam across the 39,000-acre wild horse range .	they are looking for 40 specific individuals .	consequently , the agency has invested a lot of time since june setting up the four trap sites , baiting them and then culling the horses .	so far , 25 horses and two foals have been captured that are targeted for removal .	they and the others that are eventually captured will be adopted on sept. 8 by people who prequalify at the blm 's britton springs facility , north of lovell , wyo. .	this summer 's culling is part of the blm 's management plan for the scenic and sprawling wild horse range that straddles the montana-wyoming border .	the agency wants to keep the range 's horse numbers at around 130 . "	as soon as we get over 130 we start picking up the overuse " of the range , said jared bybee , blm wild horse and burro specialist for the blm 's billings field office .	removing horses from the herd that traces some of its genes back to the first horses brought to the americas has long been a controversial matter .	wild horse advocates argue that the range is in good shape without culling the horses .	they say that horses would naturally regulate their numbers and that they should be allowed a larger range that includes adjacent forest service land .	they also worry that culling could harm the herds ' unique genetics .	but the blm has developed a plan with public input and is sticking to it .	in the past , they have used helicopter roundups to herd horses into corrals for adoption .	using bait traps will save the agency money and is easier on the horses , but it takes more man hours spread out over much of the summer , sparks said .	ideally , he added , the blm would gather only 10 horses every couple of years to keep the population stable .	to that end , a contraceptive is also being used to try and reduce the number of wild horse births .	so far this summer , eight mares , six yearlings , seven stallions and three foals have been retained for adoption .	they are being held at blm 's britton springs corrals .	which horses are targeted for removal based on their age , sex and how well their bloodline is represented on the range , said kristen lenhardt , a blm information officer .	any other horses that wander into the traps that are n't targeted for removal are released .	so far , 96 horses have been corralled .	the earliest ones gathered that have been retained for adoption were captured on july 11 and 12 .	the rest came in on july 20 and 27 .	the traps were first set up on the lower elevations of the range on june 20 .	those horses proved the most difficult to trap since they are more skittish about the sight of humans .	on july 9 the traps atop the pryors were set up .	those horses show little fear of humans and have been much easier to trap .	unfortunately for blm , two bands ?	those led by studs duke and jackson ?	have largely avoided the trap sites . "	we 're down to two bands that we need to get horses out of , but they 're the two biggest bands and the studs are reluctant to bring them in , " bybee said .	on wednesday afternoon , however , duke finally showed up in the trap set up atop the pryor mountains above krueger pond .	inside the corral , duke whinnied to his mares hiding in the spruce trees hundreds of yards away as a band of young studs hovered close to the trap site , eagerly waiting for a food handout .	duke was being used as bait to bring the mares closer , hopefully into the trap .	but it 's a waiting game , bybee said . "	it 's kind of like baseball , nothing happens and then , bam ! "
after the christmas tree is down and the new year ushered in , a couple from loretto will lovingly wrap in archival paper thousands of documents about the life and thoughts of prince demetrius gallitzin .	frank and betty seymour , after more than two decades of research and study , will send the documents off to the vatican as the next step in their campaign to have gallitzin deemed a saint .	the scores of information will go to rome for further research and study .	copies will also go to two commissioners established within the altoona-johnstown roman catholic diocese for dissection and research .	the thousands of documents to the vatican must be sealed in wax and the seymours hope , hand delivered early next year . "	we gather all of the research and it must be presented in an absolute perfect fashion , " betty seymour said . "	that will be a great day for us . "	this next step in what has been termed the " ladder " toward sainthood for the man who was a russian prince , marks completion of the " inquiry phase . "	the goal of the seymours and others was to prove gallitzin lived a life full of virtue , something they think they have done .	the research will be reviewed by a historical commission , which will look at gallitzin and his role in the very young america and region .	the theological commission must rule on everything concerning gallitzin 's writings , his theology and his faith compared with the theology of the catholic church at that time .	gallitzin was born in 1770 in the hague , netherlands , the son of russian nobility .	at age 29 , he emigrated to the united states .	it was after he came to this country that he became a catholic and entered the priesthood .	in the winter of 1799 , the russian priest came to mcguire settlement , later to be named loretto .	his efforts are credited with what remains today a stronghold of catholicism in the region .	gallitzin , eventually dubbed " the apostle of the alleghenies , " started it all when he built a log cabin church and held the area 's first christmas eve mass , frank seymour said .	the seymours and a handful of others , including the rev. allen zeth , and msgr. timothy swope , are significant parts of the sainthood effort .	zeth is the diocese 's vocational director and director of diocesan shrines .	swope is rector of the basilica of st. michael the archangel , loretto .	while the seymours and others are satisfied with the work they have completed in the inquiry phase , they acknowledge the biggest hurdle to cross is a miracle that can be directly credited to gallitzin .	it must include a thorough investigation that removes all doubt that divine intervention was involved . "	god provides the miracle , but it 's through the intercession of the saints , " swope said . "	it 's different than saying aunt minnie was a saint .	god works through his family . "	frank seymour added : " it 's beyond all understanding . "	betty seymour tells the story of a woman whose son could not find a job .	they started praying to gallitzin , and after two years he got a job at georgetown university . "	we 've gotten a number of these , but it 's not something we can prove , " she said .	the miracle must be something current , not reports of something done when gallitzin was still alive , the seymours said .	it must be something that can be investigated , people can be interviewed and all doubts removed . "	it ca n't be a miracle from way back when .	they do n't want an old miracle , " betty seymour said . "	it must be something from today . "	the vatican must approve gallitzin for veneration and beatification before he can be considered for sainthood .	research shows mention of gallitzin and sainthood documented in the 1870s , but nothing came of it , frank seymour said .	talk stirred again in the 1960s , but died away .	this latest effort to seek sainthood for gallitzin started when betty seymour , a schoolteacher , took a sabbatical in 1988 .	at the urging of her husband , she spent a winter studying gallitzin documents .	frank seymour , retired after many years of working for the commonwealth of pennsylvania at the ebensburg center , soon joined in what they can only describe as a journey .	word of the seymours ' efforts reached bishop joseph adamec , who in 2005 announced gallitzin had attained the status of " servant of god , " the first of a number of hurdles on the way to sainthood .	the ruling was by the congregation of saints of the holy see , which allowed for the formation of a task force .	in 2007 , the cause for sainthood officially opened and the seymours and others began the inquiry phase . "	the vatican found no impediment that stood in our way for pursuing this , " betty seymour said .	it is the inquiry phase that is coming to an end , with all the translations and research passed onto higher authorities .	while gallitzin died long before the construction of the elegant , gray stone basilica of st. michael the archangel , he is credited with establishing the parish and what is now much of loretto .	the west quad of what is now the parish cemetery was the home of the first log church 221 years ago .	in 1808 , it was enlarged , and in 1817 was doubled in size to a frame church .	records show that in 1853 it was replaced with a brick church on the present site of st. michael 's and in 1899 a new structure built , frank seymour said .	steel magnate charles schwab hired a pittsburgh architect and allocated $ 60,000 for a new church .	the final price was well over budget , he said , with the range between $ 160,000 and $ 170,000 .	economics do not play a role in this modern-day pursuit of sainthood for gallitzin , but the impact could be significant for the region , frank seymour said . "	if sainthood is ever declared , this town will turn into a mecca , " he said .	any idea that the seymours have no personal interest in this pursuit for sainthood , and its importance to loretto , would be incorrect .	two of betty seymour 's ancestors came to the area with gallitzin and one was his carpenter .	frank seymour is a first cousin twice removed to charles schwab .

as powerful as fans and even rival sports leagues believe it to be , even the nfl ca n't do anything about the weather .	yet some 24 hours after the chicago bears closed out a dangerous afternoon at soldier field in light rain with a 23-20 overtime win against visiting baltimore , more than a few people in the windy city were still shaking their heads .	and not just because of dropping temperatures and still-gusting winds that lingered across the chicago area monday ?	remnants of a late-season storm that spawned tornadoes and slammed the midwest a day earlier , leaving six dead and dozens injured downstate .	instead , many wondered why sunday 's nfl game kicked off at its scheduled noon start time , with the threat of lightning , high winds and a torrential downpour bearing down on the city 's lakefront stadium . "	hindsight being 20-20 , it 's easy to say they should have waited , " said steve woltmann , a freelance photographer who has covered games at soldier field for nearly three decades . "	and honestly , i got a few texts from home long before kickoff warning some crazy stuff was headed right at us . "	but as many times as i 've been there , you never know how the lake will affect a front rolling in , " he added . "	it 's why people here say if you do n't like the weather , just wait a few minutes and it will change . "	this time , the change came so suddenly that gene steratore , head of the officiating crew , barely had enough time to put down a cellphone he was using to communicate with nfl officials before informing the crowd of 60,000-plus : " due to the inclement weather , the game will be temporarily suspended . "	seconds later , players scrambled for the locker rooms and announcements over the public-address system and on the scoreboard instructed fans to take cover in the nearest concourse area .	then came the deluge . "	because there 's so many moving pieces , we always try to play games as scheduled .	between our broadcasters and all the other logistics involved , we 're trying to put them on for the widest possible audience , " nfl spokesman brian mccarthy said . "	but we 'd never endanger our fans or our players , officials or stadium .	that 's always concern no. 1 . "	and as soon as the potential for severe lightning became apparent , we took steps to get everybody out of harm 's way . "	the delay began with 4:51 remaining in the opening quarter , following a 52-yard field goal by justin tucker that put the ravens ahead 10-0 , and lasted nearly two hours .	players napped , snacked and walked through formations .	fans eventually returned to find sunshine and calm , but the storm returned again after halftime , turning the stands into a patchwork quilt of ponchos , and the playing field into a quagmire .	the game took nearly five hours to complete . "	the footing was terrible , but it was definitely some ' old-school football ' out there , " bears defensive end julius peppers said afterward . "	it was fun . "	not everyone was quite so charmed .	both the bears and the nfl came in for questioning over the decision , especially in light of how organizers have handled weather threats at other big events .	the league reviews game operations after each week and this one will be no exception .	it could prove especially useful , since the 2014 super bowl is scheduled to be played at new jersey 's metlife stadium in february ?	the first time the season 's biggest game will be played outdoors in a northern city , let alone during a week when some forecasters are predicting blizzard-like storms .	the nfl has already said it could shift the feb. 2 kickoff a day ahead or behind if weather dictates . "	we 've got contingency plans for our contingency plans on that one , " mccarthy said .	ultimate authority to suspend or cancel games rests with commissioner roger goodell , although the review process begins much farther down the chain .	an nfl official at each site every week is in contact with the teams , stadium operations and officiating crews before kickoff ?	and if conditions warrant , with local law enforcement agencies .	the nfl is not alone , of course , in dealing with the weather .	tragically , seven people were killed and dozens injured when storm-driven wind gusts knocked down heavy stage rigging during a sugarland concert at the indiana state fair in august 2011 .	two investigations found the rigging was n't strong enough to meet state building codes and that the fair lacked a fully developed emergency plan .	a month ago , the final day of the austin city limits music festival was canceled after a storm dumped nearly a foot of rain on that city in a 12-hour period .	in july , a severe line of thunderstorms forced officials at wrigley field on chicago 's north side to clear the stage and field during a pearl jam concert before resuming more than two hours later .	the same night at a different concert venue along the lake , a phish show came to an abrupt end as fans were told to leave an open-air amphitheater .	sunday 's delay marked the fourth time this season nfl officials have been forced to suspend play , including a 34-minute halt in baltimore 's opening-week game at denver because of lightning .	oddly enough , it was the third time this year the ravens have been involved , dating back to the super bowl , when an electrical failure knocked out most of the lights inside the superdome . "	we knew storms were on the way , " mccarthy said . "	we have meteorological firms that monitor conditions , both nationally and locally , heading into the weekend , and then we keep monitoring them in real time all the way up to kickoff . "	on sunday , nfl official gary slaughter was charged with making the decision to go ahead as planned in chicago . "	we believed we 'd be able to play the game in its duration in the window we had , " mccarthy said . "	look , it 's one thing if the usta plans their u.s. open during a week when there 's supposed to be a monster storm , because that 's tennis . "	but football is played in tough weather all the time .	our championship games could wind up in chicago , new york or new england in mid-january .	so what happened there is something we 're always cognizant of , preparing for and , " he concluded , " always willing to learn from . "
an analyst raised his rating and price target for mastercard on friday , saying he believes the consumer spending pullback is starting to stabilize .	during the recession many consumers worried about economic volatility , high unemployment and an unstable housing market began to rein in their spending .	now that the housing market is showing some signs of improvement and unemployment is not worsening , shoppers are beginning to spend a bit again .	donald fandetti of citi investment research said in client note that mastercard inc.

heaven is about 10 acres on the tuscumbia watershed , the best-kept secret in prentiss county .	that 's where bob krick 's wife keeps her garden and where he has his shop . "	it 's my home away from home , " the 79-year-old said of his shop , which is separated from the house only by an attached garage . "	you come out here , you can forget about time .	it keeps me out of trouble . "	as far back as he can remember , krick 's had an interest in working with his hands . "	when i was boy , we had an old chicken coop that was converted into a tool shed .	i would go there and make all kinds of stuff , like wooden scooters with roller-skate wheels , " said krick , wearing suspenders patterned after a carpenter 's measuring tape .	he can still hear his grandmother 's worries , and how she repeated , " you 're going to hurt yourself .	you 're going to hurt yourself . "	and to be fair , krick is self-taught , so those early attempts with electricity caused a few sparks . "	no telling how many fuses i blew before i figured it out , " he said .	his early days were spent in hamburg , pennsylvania .	he later served a stint in the marines , got out for a while , then joined the army and made it a career .	he did n't have much of a shop during his military days , but he had friends , as well as others who wanted things . "	the barter system was alive and well , " he said . "	i needed legal work done , but i did n't have money to pay the lawyer .	he said , can you make a counter for the front of my office ? '	i said , sure . ' "	after the military , he took a series of jobs in the northeast and midwest with companies that kept going broke .	he decided to look south . "	i called a buddy i was in the army with .	i said , i 'm coming to ripley . '	he said , good , ' " krick recalled . "	that was in 1980 ; since then , i 've had ups and downs , good times and rough times , but it 's settled down . "	through it all , he 's had his hobby , though it has n't always been a hobby .	he spent several years teaching cabinet-making and millwork to students in corinth .	his students came to him one day looking for a challenge , and krick remembered a 1740 handkerchief table with a folding top he 'd seen in a magazine . "	they made 10 of them out of different kinds of wood , " krick said .	he made one for himself out of black cherry that sits in his guest bedroom .	he also crafted one each for his daughter and granddaughter .	in effect , krick is in the early stages of an antique business .	all he needs is for his creations to survive for a few generations . "	i feel like i 've got to be a perfectionist on some things , " he said .	krick made his grandson a writing table based on the one thomas jefferson used when he wrote the declaration of independence . "	he was tickled to death to get that , " krick said .	he built a musical jewelry box for his wife , and she cried when he gave it to her . "	it was just too sweet , " lucy krick said .	a stepdaughter asked for a wall armoire to hold jewelry .	it 's in process and was sitting on krick 's homemade shop table .	much of his work goes to family , but not all .	he enjoys making wooden bowls and giving them away . "	people say bring them to the fall festival , but it 's not something i want to sell , " he said . "	the look on their faces makes you feel good inside .	it 's something you made and they appreciate it . "	i could sell them , but you ca n't sell everything you make .	sometimes , you just have to give it away . "	several years ago , a guy asked if krick could repair his violin .	the answer turned out to be yes , and krick was intrigued .	he heard about a violin maker from verona who died , so he met the man 's widow and bought a violin .	he took it apart , put it back together and sold it , and repeated the process . "	then one day , i said , ' you need to make one of these things before you die , ' " krick said . "	i got to liking it so much that i made one after another . "	it 's exacting work that appealed to krick 's perfectionist tendencies . "	a violin has to be right , " he said . "	there is no right and wrong about it .	it has to be right . "	he has a stockpile that he 'd tried to sell for $ 1,500 a piece , and recently cut the price to $ 800 . "	but people around here think $ 150 is way too much , " he said . "	any violins i 've sold were out of state . "	no matter what happens to the others , one violin is n't going anywhere .	he spotted a batch of tiger maple on sale on ebay for more than $ 200 , and asked a friend to buy it .	the friend said the purchase had been made but the wood never arrived .	krick was getting worried . "	i was sitting on the back deck and my girls came up with it and said , here it is papa . '	they 'd bought it for me for father 's day , " he said , moments after playing " ashokan farewell " on the tiger maple violin . "	i 'm not going to sell this one . "	the shop 's always ready when he is , and there 's no shortage of projects . "	i 've slowed down but not much , " krick said . "	if something gives me an idea , i 'll do it .	i 'll get down and do a drawing and just do it . "	it should be noted that the bit of heaven he shares with his wife has a fishing lake , so krick does n't have to go to his shop unless he wants to . "	i always say if a man has to be told what to do when he 's retired , he 's not retired , " krick said . "	i can always find something to do . "
the mueller family had taken pains to avoid any unnecessary medical interventions .	they hired a midwife for the birth of young taige and felt relieved when they learned the baby would n't need the routine antibiotics some infants require after birth .	they turned to a naturopathic physician for medical care .	when they took her to a hospital with a fever about five weeks later , their objection to a spinal tap to check for meningitis led to a federal lawsuit that now forces a jury to balance parents ' rights to determine a child 's medical care against the requirements doctors face when they believe a child may be in imminent danger .	the low-grade fever concerned corissa mueller enough to take her daughter to the local hospital for an exam when the family 's naturopathic doctor could n't examine the child right away .	when an emergency room physician asked to perform a battery of tests and treatments , mueller approved some but rejected others . "	yes " to blood and urine tests , she told workers at st. luke 's medical center in boise . "	yes " to intravenous fluids . "	no " to a spinal tap ?	the standard test to check for a life-threatening meningitis infection and other major infections ?	and " no " to a preventive dose of full-spectrum antibiotics .	a few hours later , police officers and state officials seized custody of taige , and doctors performed a spinal tap against corissa mueller 's wishes .	for a time , police barred the distraught mom from calling another doctor or her husband , threatening her with handcuffs and jail .	the muellers were ordered to attend a court hearing for medical neglect .	and when all the tests and treatments were done , the diagnosis came in : taige had a virus , perhaps the same cold that the rest of her family had been battling that week . "	no doctor , no police department can take your child away from you in a violation of your constitutional rights , " the mueller 's attorney , jon steele , told jurors in u.s. district court in opening statements thursday .	in a few weeks , taige will be 8 years old .	she was n't harmed by the spinal tap , nor did the test find any indication of spinal meningitis or other potentially fatal infections .	the muellers filed their lawsuit against the state , the city of boise , dr. richard macdonald and st. luke 's regional medical center in 2004 , saying their constitutional rights and state rules were violated when taige was briefly pulled from their custody in 2002 .	after nearly six years of legal battles , it wo n't likely be an easy decision for the jury of three women and five men .	taige 's temperature was 100.8 when she arrived at the hospital ?	high enough that national medical standards call for spinal taps to automatically be done in a child of that age , attorneys representing the defendants told the jury .	the reason , macdonald 's attorney richard hall told jurors , is that serious infections like meningitis and sepsis can kill babies within hours of the time they fall ill .	antibiotics are given preventatively to begin fighting any major infections while doctors wait for test results .	and macdonald estimated that about 5 percent ?	that 's one in 20 ?	babies with symptoms similar to taige 's will be found to have meningitis , hall said .	those that do face dire risks , including brain damage , loss of limbs and death . "	taige became his responsibility that evening , " hall said . "	but taige 's life and health ran into a contest with corissa mueller 's personal opinion .	... corissa wanted dr. macdonald to roll the dice with taige 's life . "	the city police officers faced the same dilemma , said boise attorney kirt naylor . "	she could n't tell anyone she was sick .	she had to rely on others to care for her , " naylor said of taige .	detective dale rogers , the senior police officer that night , " could n't just walk away if taige was the one out of the 20 .

a new electronic system now in use in jefferson county is designed to speed up the delivery of emergency protective orders in domestic violence cases by making the orders available to law enforcement in as little as 30 minutes .	jefferson family court chief judge steven george said he believes the e-epo system is the first of its kind in kentucky .	george , joined monday by other public officials at a press conference in louisville , said the system should cut the time between someone seeking help for domestic violence and a signed order being made available to sheriff 's deputies .	under the e-epo system , a person can request an emergency protective order , which is then electronically transmitted to a judge for a signature , then sent to sheriff 's deputies on the street through the law enforcement information network , making it accessible through their computers . "	we now have another tool in our toolbox , " jefferson county clerk of court david nicholson said .	an emergency protective order is issued for up to 14 days when an allegation of domestic violence is made and is designed to keep a victim and the accused apart .	the order stays in place until a hearing on the allegation can be held .	after a hearing , a judge may issue a domestic violence order , which can be issued for up to three years .	domestic violence orders are not part of the new electronic system . "	but , very quickly after a domestic violence order hearing , an order is entered " and made electronically available to law enforcement , george said . "	for the victim , time is of the essence , " said marta miranda , executive director of the center for women and families in louisville .	christian county in southwestern kentucky is set to become the second jurisdiction to use the system , with expectations of coming online in a few weeks , george said .	jefferson county started using the e-epo system in august .	the announcement came monday because october is domestic violence awareness month .	louisville mayor greg fischer said since the system went live , nearly 400 epos and more than 110 domestic violence summonses have been issued electronically .	the system also has the benefit of easing the concerns of women who go to the court 's domestic violence intake center , fischer said . "	these folks are in a situation , frequently petrified , " fischer said .	u.s. rep. john yarmuth , d-ky. , said domestic violence costs about $ 8 billion a year in medical services for victims and lost productivity .	the e-epo system means a better chance at protecting victims and preventing lost time , money and , in some cases , lives , he said . "	this makes it easier and faster for victims to get help , " yarmuth said .

the book is called " a new history of mississippi , " and a new approach is what dennis mitchell wanted when he wrote it .	the professor at mississippi state university-meridian casts a critical eye on the " moonlight and magnolias " school of southern history , trying to communicate decades of recent scholarship to readers with a decided emphasis on the post-civil war period .	the first general history of the state for adult readers in nearly 40 years , the book focuses on mississippi 's central dilemma of race .	it 's being adopted by some universities and could be influential for years . "	i felt like there was a real need for it because the last history for general readers was in 1976 , " mitchell said . "	there 's been a huge mountain of scholarship about mississippi published since then . "	the book is deeply informed by all those works .	mitchell said he had " thousands " of sticky notes on books , dissertations and theses that he used as he wrote to flag information he wanted to fold in .	much of that academic scholarship is hard to access for general readers , even those who patronize the best-stocked bookstores and public libraries .	more than half of the 593-page book , published by the university press of mississippi earlier this year , covers 1900 to present . "	if you stop and think about it , there 's been a lot of history since the civil war , " mitchell said .	targeting general readers , though , the book is n't footnoted and tries to account for the lives of regular people as well as political leaders . "	i felt liberated , in a way , to tell the story a little more freely and openly .	it allowed a little better flow in writing . "	mitchell said of skipping footnotes .	mitchell 's book downgrades some traditional pillars , such as l.q.c. lamar , the post-civil war u.s. senator long acclaimed as a spokesman for sectional reconciliation .	lamar went on to serve as u.s. secretary of the interior and later became the only mississippian to ever serve on the u.s. supreme court .	the book finds lamar complicit in the violence of the 1875 state elections , which swept away republican control of state government for more than a century and eventually led to the elimination of black voting in 1890 .	he writes that " old heroes " such as lamar and james z. george have " lost their luster in an age accepting racial equality as a given . " "	i think lamar has gotten a pass for a long time , " mitchell said . "	he was the front man for the violence that the redeemers used to eliminate the black votes . "	the author says a critical look at the state 's past can help mississippi move forward today . "	i thought that mississippians were n't going to progress until they come to terms with their past , " mitchell said . "	people act on their ideas about the past . "	mitchell closes his book on a positive note , saying " the civil rights movement freed all mississippians ?	black and white ?	from an oppressive system that kept both races on the bottom of almost every national yardstick of progress . "	the author says he sees that progress in his own classes in meridian , where he notes white students are descendants of a community that produced the klansmen who killed james earl chaney , andrew goodman , and michael schwerner in the summer of 1964 in neshoba county .	today , he says white students are appalled at those acts . "	what gives me hope about not only the future but our misunderstood past is all the stories i could find of people who were able to cross the racial divide , " mitchell said . "	to me , they 're the best thing about our history . "

two prominent nonprofit organizations in the netherlands have offered widely differing estimates of the harm caused to developing countries by multinationals exploiting the dutch tax system .	the seo , or institute for economic investigation , a think-tank linked to the university of amsterdam , said in a report published tuesday that developing countries lose out on around 145 million euros ( $ 192 million ) annually as a result of dutch tax law .	the report says the system makes it easy for multinational companies to funnel money through the netherlands to tax havens .	the seo study was funded by the financial industry , but researchers were granted access by the dutch central bank to tax information that is not public .	a second study using public sources , carried out by the center for the investigation of multinational companies , estimated that dutch tax practices deprive brazil alone of 147 million euros in annual tax revenues .	the seo study estimated that ?	125 billion euros is routed through the country annually by companies that are registered in the netherlands , but have few employees and comparatively little economic activity here .	these are frequently called " mailbox companies , " though they include large multinationals .	the tax avoidance industry creates around 10,000 jobs in the netherlands for the tax specialists and accountants who help 12,000 such companies lower their tax rates , adding around ?	3 billion to the dutch economy , the seo study said .	the government 's top economic official , frans weekers , responded to the report by denying the netherlands is a " tax haven .

connecticut 's roman catholic bishops are urging parishes to fight legislation that would extend the statute of limitation in civil child sex abuse cases .	the bishops asked pastors to include a bulletin insert this week that warns of potentially " disastrous " financial fallout .	the insert says the bill could dredge up claims more than 70 years old and place all church institutions at risk , even parishes free of claims .	the insert is signed by hartford archbishop henry mansell , bridgeport bishop william lori and norwich bishop michael cote .	current law gives victims until age 48 to sue .	the new law would allow people above that age to join in lawsuits filed by younger people .	state rep. beth bye , a bill co-sponsor , said the bishops ' letter was inflammatory and showed a lack of focus on abuse victims .

animal-welfare activists are preparing to fight a utah law that prohibits undercover filming at farm operations .	the animal legal defense fund is bringing together professors , undercover investigators and a 25-year-old vegetarian who was charged for filming a utah slaughterhouse .	they plan to bring a constitutional challenge to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to trespass on private property to record images or sounds of a livestock operation . "	it just bothered me , " amy meyer said of a meat-packing plant in the salt lake city suburb of draper along interstate-15 . "	i found it shocking what i could see . "	she used her digital camera to take a video of a front-end loader dumping a sick cow outside the slaughterhouse .	the recording included more graphic scenes and drew a large audience on the internet .	in utah , meyer was the first ?	and still only ?	person to be charged under a law dubbed " ag-gag " that gov. gary herbert signed in march 2012 .	prosecutors eventually dropped the charge of " agricultural operation interference " because meyer 's feb. 8 video showed that she recorded the operation from the shoulder of a public street .	the meat plant has since shielded itself from view , she said .	slaughterhouses are brutal operations the public should know about and " unfortunately , no laws protect farm animals , " said meyer , an educator at red butte gardens in salt lake city .	a sponsor of the utah law said it protects private property rights . "	it has nothing to do with animals ?	it 's people trespassing on farms " to make recordings " they go put it on the internet , " said sen. david hinkins , r-orangeville , a cattle operator who also breeds race horses . "	why pay taxes and let everyone have a free run ?	i 'm sick of it , " said hinkins , who owns several thousand acres of land in central utah . "	this is all about people trespassing on your property .	if people can sneak onto anybody 's property , then we do n't have any rights . "	the law undermines free expression , argues justin marceau , a law professor at the university of denver . "	the key is the first amendment , " he said . "	our founding fathers did n't like when government tried to control the message . "	utah lawmakers would n't think to make it a crime to surreptitiously record abuse at a child-care center , and ca n't do it just to protect livestock operators , he said .	iowa has an equally punitive law against filming livestock operations , marceau said .	other states , including kansas and montana , have older laws shielding agricultural operations that have been rarely if ever enforced , he said . "	this will be a really important case , " said marceau , who is helping prepare a lawsuit against the utah attorney general 's office .	it will list a number of notable animal-rights activists and investigators as plaintiffs , including daniel hauff-lazar .	the utah law targets people who trespass to record a livestock operation , leave a device behind for recording , or obtain access by false pretense , including by obtaining employment .	the animal legal defense fund says undercover filming has led to such landmark food safety laws as the federal meat inspection act and the pure food and drug act , which help protect the public from " mad cow " disease , e. coli and salmonella . "	these laws have made it virtually impossible to do any whistleblowing or independent investigation , " marceau said .
the state 's auditor says five ohio school districts have used questionable attendance policies and practices , putting them at a higher risk for scrubbing attendance data to improve their school report cards .	the districts are cleveland , columbus , toledo , marion and campbell in mahoning county .	scrubbing is the practice of removing students from enrollment without lawful reason .	state auditor dave yost released the preliminary findings thursday as part of his investigation into potentially irregular attendance and enrollment practices around the state .	he anticipates the last pre-election update by oct. 23 , two weeks ahead of fall levy votes in many districts . "	my sense is most schools are not doing this , " yost said . "	my sense is also that as we continue this work , we are going to find other schools . "	yost cautioned that his review has not addressed districts ' motives for scrubbing the data .	he said it could be entirely innocuous . "	there 's always been the possibility of criminal referrals .	ohio has a records tampering statute .	it 's a serious matter , " he said . "	that said , it does have a ' mens rea , ' or an intent element , to it .	and so the kind of work we 've done here is necessary to support a criminal prosecution but it 's not sufficient . "	the results released thursday were drawn from a review of an initial 100 school buildings ?	or about 3 percent of ohio 's 3,688 public schools .	the schools , housed in 47 districts , were selected for initial review because they had the highest number of student assessment test takers whose scores were " rolled up " to the state level and removed from district averages .	in a statement , columbus superintendent gene harris said she 'd hoped the preliminary report would offer schools more guidance about improving how they record attendance data , and she expects the auditor to provide specific recommendations in the future . "	i am determined that we will fully address any shortfalls in student record-keeping and/or reporting , " she said . "	this data is vitally important to us as a management tool ?	and it is vitally important that the community can trust our information . "	yost said some schools in the five districts withdrew students based on a pattern of absences , which could have been influenced by lower test scores , without proper documentation .	that included toledo city schools , which automatically withdraws students who have had a total of 20 unexcused absences for the year after five consecutive days of them .	auditors found the district dropped this " 5/20 rule , " then reinstituted it after seeing a decline in local report card rankings .	cleveland failed to document student withdrawals under a similar policy as a matter of routine , yost said . "	so we have to report that cleveland is unauditable , " he said .	in columbus , 81 of 82 files for questionably withdrawn students lacked proper documentation .	their cases were selected from among about 10,000 students who withdrew during the 120-day window when student performance counts toward their school 's overall ranking yet showed up as withdrawing after the window had closed , the report said .	the superintendent said she was troubled that some targeted student files could n't be found but noted that it 's a large district in which many students change schools during the year .	harris said she planned to look into the issue further before drawing any conclusions .	state auditors found that 32 of 40 student withdrawals flagged for examination in campbell were similarly unsupported . "	this is more than nitpicking about pieces of paper , " yost said . "	without the records , there is no evidence that the actions were properly taken by the government . "	he said marion 's scenario was slightly different .	chronically truant students were automatically transferred to a new " digital academy " that administrators believed might serve them better academically .	the policy was in place for only one year .	he said administrators or administrative staff , not teachers , generally perform the withdrawal function . "	it may occur in the superintendent 's office , it may be part of the ( role of the ) principals , assistant principal .	it may be done by clerical staff under the direction of someone else , or perhaps ( by ) the attendance officer at the individual schools , " he said . "	the practice varies by district , even by building . "	his report recommends that the ohio department of education improve the independence of its accountability measures and that report card performance ratings be removed from a location where many people can manipulate the outcome .

"	times square is considered the crossroads of the world in no small part because dick clark 's new year 's eve celebrations there were beamed across the globe , " mayor michael bloomberg said in a statement . "	generations of americans grew up with dick , and yet he seemed forever young .	his spirit will always live on in times square , and in the hearts of millions of new yorkers . "	pat montesione of yorktown , n.y. , recalled watching clark not only on new year 's eve but also on clark 's other television programming .	news of clark 's death was " devastating , " the 63-year-old montesione said .

the former democratic congressman made a national political splash when he left alabama and switched to the gop , garnering a key speaking role at the 2012 republican convention .	now , davis is seeking to run as a democrat in alabama again -- this time for a montgomery county commission race -- and has filed a lawsuit after party leaders refused to reinstate him .	in an interview with the associated press , davis discussed his defection to the gop , his political future and why running as a democrat again is the best fit for him . "	during the period in 2013 , i started to question for myself whether ideologically the republican party was the best fit for me .	i view myself as a political moderate , " davis said .	to win as a republican , he sensed that he would have to campaign as a " ben carson , herman cain kind of figure , one who was very , very conservative . " "	that did n't fit my views , " he said .	davis said he became a republican after moving to virginia , believing a political centrist would be a better fit for the virginia republican party .	but in alabama , where the gop skews farther right , a moderate who supports a minimum wage increase , is more at home among democrats , he argued .	davis for years was a rising star in alabama politics .	the harvard law graduate in 2002 upset an entrenched congressman and party hierarchy in the process .	in 2010 , he launched a bid to become the first african-american governor in the deep south .	however , he lost the democratic primary to ron sparks , a white candidate , after the state 's black political organizations -- with which davis always had a tense relationship -- backed sparks .	he also came under fire from party faithful offended by his vote against the affordable care act .	after losing the race , davis moved to virginia and in 2012 announced his alignment with the gop .	he was rewarded with a speaking role at 2012 republican national convention , telling a cheering crowd , " thank you for welcoming me where i belong " before launching into criticisms of president barack obama , whom he endorsed four years prior .	davis shifted direction with a return to his montgomery hometown to focus on local politics .	he ran unsuccessfully in this year 's nonpartisan mayoral race .	vowing a rematch , he also eyed a run for county commission , a partisan race , but the democratic party executive board refused to reinstate him , citing the " radney rule " that prohibits someone from running as a democrat if they supported another party within the last four years .	davis ' lawsuit argued he is being singled out since the party reinstated every other candidate who asked to come back .	his effort to return to the democratic fold met with opposition from those infuriated by his actions and the party powerbrokers who opposed him in 2010 and other points in his career .	davis blamed long-simmering tensions with joe reed , head of the alabama democratic conference . "	joe reed has used the threat of withholding the black vote as a club over democratic party for a long period of time and continues to use it as a club today , " davis said .	reed scoffed , saying he did vote against a motion to reinstate davis , but so did 19 of the 20 board members . "	he walked off and denounced the party , denounced the president , " reed said . "	he does n't have any inherent right to come back . "	others have argued that democrats , who have been obliterated from statewide office in the deeply red state , should n't be so quick to rebuke someone who wants to rejoin their ranks " voters ought to decide who is elected to office and not committees , " said giles perkins , a former executive director of the state democratic party .	davis said if he loses his fight , he will maintain his focus on the next montgomery mayoral race .	he said he believes he still has contributions to make , if voters , and his former party , will let him try . "	i did n't commit a crime .	i was n't in jail for three years .	i left a political party and joined another , " davis said .
embattled by months of crackdowns , bahrain 's shiite muslim majority held onto its strength in parliament , according to election results announced sunday , but fell short of dealing a humbling blow against the minority sunni rulers of this island kingdom and key u.s. ally .	bahrain 's ruling sunni dynasty hoped that saturday 's vote would showcase one of the rare examples of western-style elections in the conservative gulf arab region and portray a sense of order in a country with strategic links , including being the home port of the u.s. 5th fleet ?	one of the pentagon 's major counterweights against expanding iranian military power in the area .	the shiites , meanwhile , sought political payback with some of their top figures jailed and facing trial later this week on charges of plotting a coup .	each came up short on some counts .	election officials face claims of problems , including at least 2,000 voters reportedly turned away at the polls because of faulty lists .	the biggest shiite bloc , meanwhile , did not even aim for a majority in the 40-seat parliament ?	fielding 18 candidates and winning each race ?	while falling back on its claims that the voting system is engineered to undercut their population advantage .	but the overall advantage appeared to go to the sunni rulers because of the relatively high turnout of 67 percent and the strong shiite participation , said shadi hamid , a researcher on gulf affairs at the brookings doha center in neighboring qatar . "	the big winner here is the government , " said hamid . "	they have a turnout that is higher than most western countries and can use it to point to the international community and say , ' look , we still have democracy here . ' "	election results announced sunday on state television gave 18 of the 40 seats to the largest shiite political group and 13 to pro-government sunnis .	the remaining nine races will go to a second round on oct. 30 .	they are mostly between backers of the ruling system ?	which is almost certain to come away with a majority in the chamber .	many races were hotly contested with billboards and door-to-door campaigning .	but the outcome has little meaning to how bahrain is actually run .	all important decisions rest with king hamad bin isa al khalifa , bahrain 's monarch , and his extended clan .	shiites , however , see parliament as their best forum to press their complaints about perceived second-class status even though they account for about 70 percent of bahrain 's 530,000 citizens .	the leader of al wefaq , the main shiite political group , alleged at least 2,000 voters were blocked from casting ballots because of incomplete lists .	sheik ali salman told the associated press they will not seek to challenge the entire election results .	but he described it as part of their overall complaints about a lopsided system , which they claim includes gerrymandered voting districts to dilute shiite strength and a government-backed program to give citizenship to sunnis from across the middle east to boost their ranks . "	we really are n't satisfied with the outcome , " he said . "	we are the majority of the country and a majority of the voters , but we do n't get a majority of the ( parliament ) seats .	why is that ?	it is clear that the government is doing this to keep us from gaining a bigger voice .	we wo n't be satisfied until the election rules have changed . "	he also listed as priorities : holding officials accountable for political detentions and alleged torture behind bars .	more than 250 people have been taken into custody since the crackdowns began in august . "	we have no intention of remaining quiet over this , " said salman .	washington has taken a cautious line on bahrain .	a flurry of diplomatic talks sought to express u.s. concern about the arrests and the violent backlash , including running street battles last summer .	but washington can not afford to alienate bahrain 's solidly pro-western sunni rulers , who have tribal and marriage ties across the gulf .	there is also the hot-button issue of iran in the background .	bahrain 's sunni rulers see themselves as front-line defenders against suspected efforts by iran to expand its influence in the region ?	although there is no clear evidence that tehran has links to shiite political groups in bahrain .	washington wants to stay on the best possible terms with all arab gulf regimes , which all share deep worries about iran 's ambitions . "	does iran wield influence in bahrain ?	most people would say no .	but do some inside bahrain 's ruling system believe it ?	probably , and it 's a good way to open up a front against what they see are threats to the system , " said toby jones , an expert on sunni-shiite affairs at rutgers university .	the new parliament has just one woman ?	a pro-government candidate who ran unopposed .	one of the most closely watched run-off races involves another woman : retired sunni professor , muneera fakhro , who is considered a leading independent voice and a potential ally of the shiite bloc .	fakhro failed in her parliament bid in the 2006 elections and has accused authorities of rigging the vote against her .
a psychologist testified that a jetblue airways pilot who screamed about religion and terrorists during a flight had " a brief psychotic disorder " due to lack of sleep , according to a transcript of the trial obtained by the associated press on tuesday .	a judge found clayton osbon not guilty by reason of insanity during a brief and unpublicized trial earlier this month in texas .	osbon had been charged with interference with a flight crew for his behavior on a march 27 flight from new york to las vegas .	passengers said they wrestled the pilot to the floor after he ran through the plane 's cabin yelling about jesus and al-qaida .	the flight was diverted and safely landed in texas .	according to the court transcripts , forensic neuropsychologist robert e.h. johnson testified that osbon 's disorder lasted about a week after the incident .	johnson did n't specify how long osborn may have gone without sleep , and his psychiatric evaluation was sealed during the trial , but he said he determined osbon suffered from brief psychotic disorder and delusions " secondary to sleep deprivation . "	osborn , who was taken to a mental health facility after the flight , could not appreciate the nature and quality of his actions and he did n't appreciate their wrongfulness , johnson testified .	jetblue airways corp. declined to comment on the psychologist 's testimony , citing no medical authority on the topic .	but company spokeswoman sharon jones said osbon did not fly march 24 or march 25 , and worked a round-trip flight march 26 that gave him 17 hours of off time leading into the flight march 27 .	the federal aviation administration is still investigating , spokesman lynn lunsford said , adding : " it 's still too early to draw conclusions about any potential actions that might occur as the result of this incident . "	osbon is at a mental health facility in fort worth .	court records show he is scheduled for another hearing early next month where the burden will be on him to show " by clear and convincing evidence " that his release would not pose future danger .	u.s. district judge mary lou robinson sealed johnson 's psychiatric evaluation and said during the trial that it would remain the sealed .	osbon showed up at the airport unusually late for the march 27 flight , and the plane was in midair when he eerily told his first officer they would n't make it to their destination , according to court documents .	he then started rambling about religion , the documents say .	he scolded air traffic controllers to quiet down , then turned off the radios altogether and dimmed the monitors in the cockpit .	he said aloud that " things just do n't matter " and encouraged his co-pilot they take a leap of faith , according to court documents .	the first officer then " became really worried , " according to a sworn affidavit from fbi agent john whitworth . "	osbon started trying to correlate completely unrelated numbers like different radio frequencies , and he talked about sins in las vegas . "	osbon then left the cockpit , according to witness accounts compiled by investigators .	osbon , described by neighbors in georgia as tall and muscular , " aggressively " grabbed the hands of a flight attendant who confronted him and later sprinted down the cabin while being chased .	from inside the locked cockpit , which osbon tried to re-enter by banging on the door , the co-pilot gave an order through the intercom to restrain osbon , the affidavit said .	passengers wrestled osbon to the ground .	one female flight attendant 's ribs were bruised , though no one on board was seriously hurt .	at least 10 passengers sued jetblue after the incident , claiming they feared for their lives and that the airline was " grossly negligent " in allowing osbon to fly .	faa rules going into effect late next year add specifics to how much time a pilot must get to rest .	the new rule requires a pilot have a 10-hour rest period , including eight hours of uninterrupted sleep opportunity .	currently , rules specify that a pilot must get nine hours of rest , reducible to eight hours , but do not factor in sleep opportunity .

a speeding pickup ran head-on into two cars friday on a rural highway in san diego county , leaving four people dead and three injured , including a 5-year-old girl , authorities said .	the chevy silverado was speeding northbound on state route 67 between poway and ramona in damp , misty conditions when the driver apparently lost control , crossed into oncoming traffic , california highway patrol officer brian pennings said .	the truck collided with a toyota camry , then a toyota corolla .	a 78-year-old man who was driving the camry and a 74-year-old woman in his passenger seat were killed , the county coroner said in a statement .	both were wearing seat belts .	the female passenger was identified late friday by the coroner 's office as josefina de dios west .	no hometown was listed .	the male driver 's name was still being withheld because relatives had not been notified .	two men in the front seats of the pickup were also killed , the coroner said .	the driver of the pickup was identified by the coroner 's office late friday as alexander antonio sebastiano , 20 , of poway .	the identity of the passenger was not yet released a woman who was riding in the back seat of the truck suffered major injuries and the mother and 5-year-old daughter who were in the corolla suffered moderate injuries and were being taken to hospitals , pennings said .	none of the injuries were believed to be life-threatening , he said .	he did not immediately know the names or ages of the adults who were injured .	the crash happened on a highway that winds through rocky , scrub-covered hills about 30 miles northeast of san diego .	a long stretch remained closed in both directions for about three hours after the accident .
the dow jones industrial average has logged its first winning week in a month .	the dow rose 39 points friday and ended the week with a gain of 2.8 percent , its best weekly advance since mid-february .	the market slid in morning trading on disappointing retail sales numbers but started to pare its losses after a report found consumers are gaining confidence in the economy .	the market climbed in the last hour of trading to end near the highs of the day .	treasury prices rose , pushing down interest rates , after spiking on thursday .	the preliminary reuters/university of michigan consumer sentiment index for june showed consumer confidence rose to its highest level since january 2008 and came in well ahead of forecasts .	the jump in confidence was an encouraging sign , but still does n't signal the all-clear for the economy , said michael sheldon , chief market strategist at rdm financial group in westport , conn. . "	we recovered some lost ground , but there is still some ways to go , " sheldon said .	that was evident in the disappointing retail sales report , which initially sent stocks lower .	the government reported that retail sales fell 1.2 percent in may .	it was the first drop in eight months .	it was a surprise to economists who had predicted the pace of growth would slow between april and may , but still rise .	companies dependent on consumer spending fell after the report .	proctor & gamble co. , which makes tide detergent and gillette razors , lost 1.5 percent .	j.c.penney co. fell 1.1 percent , while macy 's inc. shares also slipped .	technology shares got a boost after handset maker motorola inc. settled a patent dispute with research in motion ltd. .	motorola climbed 4 percent , while research in motion added less than 1 percent .	the mixed reports come a day after stocks surged on upbeat global economic figures .	the day 's swings extended the volatility that has been seen in recent weeks .	the dow climbed 279 points thursday on reports from china , japan and australia that indicated the global economy continues to improve .	despite the gains friday , analysts said traders are n't on edge . "	the market is nervous , " said joe heider , principal at rehmann financial in cleveland . "	it 's reacting on a day-to-day basis . "	heider said the economy is not growing fast enough to overcome the concerns about europe 's debt crisis and other issues such as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico .	that has led to fluctuations in the market , often within the same day .	as it has done for most of the week , the market shifted direction in the final hour of trading friday .	the dow rose 38.54 , or 0.4 percent , to 10,211.07 .	it had fallen nearly 90 points in morning trading .	the dow 's climb of 279 points , or 2.8 percent , during the week was its best since the week ended feb. 19 .	the standard & poor 's 500 index rose 4.76 , or 0.4 percent , to 1,091.60 , while the tech-heavy nasdaq composite index rose 24.89 , or 1.1 percent , to 2,243.60 .	for the week , the s&p 500 index rose 2.5 percent and the nasdaq rose 1.1 percent .	nearly three stocks rose for every one that fell on the new york stock exchange , where consolidated volume came to 4.1 billion shares , compared with 5.2 billion thursday .	treasury prices rose as some investors sought safety following the retail sales report .	the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury note , which moves opposite its price , fell to 3.24 percent from 3.33 percent late thursday .	friday 's reports follow a trend over the past month showing an uneven recovery , which has added concern to a market that is already struggling with worries about the health of europe 's economy .	the dow has mostly fallen since late april as investors worry about whether debt problems and steep government spending cuts in countries like greece , spain , portugal and hungary will slow europe 's economy so much that the economic slump would spread around the globe .	the euro 's level against other currencies has become a key indicator of confidence in european governments ' ability to resolve their fiscal problems .	the currency , which is used by 16 countries , was little-changed against the dollar .	it stood at $ 1.2108 late friday .	analysts say everyday investors , in particular , are still nervous about the market and economy , and are sitting on the sidelines .	that leaves institutional investors as the main players in the stock market , which explains why volatility has been so high .	institutional traders ' " sense of long-term holding is in minutes , " said bob tull , chief operating officer of old mutual global index trackers .	the quick trades and constant movement of professional money managers means stocks are bound to gyrate more than if there is a steady flow of cash from retail investors heading into the market .	proctor & gamble fell 90 cents to $ 61.01 .	j.c.penney dropped 28 cents to $ 25.99 , while macy 's fell 4 cents to $ 21.24 .	motorola rose 27 cents to $ 7.11 .	research in motion shares rose 39 cents to $ 59.50 .	crude oil fell $ 1.70 to $ 73.78 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange .	the russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.21 , or 1.4 percent , to 649.00 .	for the week , the russell rose 2.8 percent .	britain 's ftse 100 rose 0.6 percent , germany 's dax index fell 0.1 percent , and france 's cac-40 rose 1.1 percent .	japan 's nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent .
a philadelphia judge has halted wednesday 's scheduled execution of death-row inmate terrance " terry " williams and granted him a new sentencing hearing .	judge m. teresa sarmina said friday prosecutors suppressed evidence that williams ' victim was an alleged pedophile who abused boys , including williams .	however , sarmina upheld williams ' first-degree murder conviction .	williams ' lawyers say police and prosecutors withheld evidence about the sexual link between him and victim amos norwood , so the jury never heard about it before voting for a death sentence .	philadelphia prosecutors deny any wrongdoing in the 1986 trial .	williams would be the first person executed involuntarily in pennsylvania since 1962 .
southern california 's metrolink system and connex railroad filed court papers wednesday accepting the maximum $ 200 million in liability for a 2008 head-on collision between a commuter train and a freight that killed 25 people and injured more than 100 .	the sum is the maximum for a train accident under federal law , said keith millhouse , board chairman of the southern california regional rail authority . "	the rationale is this is the maximum that could be recovered in any event and will expeditiously get the maximum compensation to the victims and their families , " millhouse said .	investigators believe the commuter train 's engineer was texting when he ran a red light and collided head on with a union pacific freight train in the chatsworth area of the san fernando valley on sept. 12 , 2008 .	engineer robert sanchez , who was among those killed , was provided by connex .	the court , which has to approve the settlement , would distribute the fund to victims .	the filing noted that 109 lawsuits , almost all involving passengers , are pending in los angeles county superior court and asked that all passenger claims be consolidated into the federal proceeding . "	this ... will avoid months and perhaps years of litigation over liability and causation issues while making compensation available to passengers on an expedited basis , " the filing said .	paul r. kiesel , coordinating counsel for all the lawsuits , said the upside is that victims and families wo n't have to wait years for resolution of claims , but there is a downside as well . "	it is unfortunate that because of the scope of the harm here , the actual recoveries will be far less than the losses they 've truly suffered , " kiesel said .	kiesel said it may be the largest single train accident settlement . "	i 'm not aware of any settlement exceeding this amount , " he said .	neither metrolink nor connex revealed how much each was paying into the fund .	the proposed fund involved the cooperation of several insurance carriers , according to connex , a subsidiary of veolia transportation , which operates bus , rail and other services throughout north america .	a connex statement said the proposed fund would " provide financial recovery to victims of the accident in the full amount available to passengers of a commuter rail accident in the u.s. , and to do so years ahead of when financial recovery for victims would otherwise likely be realized . "	kiesel said that once metrolink and connex deposit the $ 200 million with the court , the process will move on to allocation of funds to claimants . "	it 's anticipated that every single claimant here will have an opportunity to fully present their claims to a judicial officer , " he said .	metrolink , created in 1992 , is a regional heavy-rail commuter system serving los angeles , orange , riverside , san bernardino and ventura counties .	the 2008 eight crash was the system 's second disaster .	in 2005 , 11 people were killed and about 180 were injured when a man who later claimed he was suicidal parked his sport utility vehicle on train tracks in suburban glendale , causing a metrolink train to derail and hit another metrolink train .	the driver of the suv was convicted of murder .
the cape cod commission has rejected a proposed four-turbine wind project in bourne .	the cape cod times reports ( http://bit.ly/zcw5s6 ) that the commission voted 8-4 on thursday that the project would have more detriments than benefits .	new generation wind proposed the project two years ago .	project proponents argued it would directly contribute to the area 's energy needs and provide economic benefits .	but opponents said the turbines posed health risks for abutters and would drag down their property values .	they also said the vegetable-oil-based lubricant to be used in the turbines was hazardous .	the commission denied the project without prejudice , meaning new generation wind can refile it for consideration at any time .
a blacksburg real estate firm can keep using the name hokie real estate under an agreement with virginia tech .	the school filed a lawsuit last year accusing the firm of trademark infringement by using the famous moniker that is the nickname for its sports teams .	the roanoke times reports ( http://bit.ly/qotrka ) that virginia tech alumnus john wilburn may not only keep using the moniker , but now gets free tickets to school football games and other incentives .	he had countersued but the case was dismissed .	as part of the settlement , wilburn agreed that virginia tech owns the rights to the term hokie and said he would never seek to register the name with either state or federal trademark agencies .	spokesman larry hincker said university officials got what they wanted from the settlement .
opponents , including students who stood and sat on the floor in a packed hearing room , argued the proposal is a violation of federal civil rights law .	the soonest that the state 's gop-controlled legislature could act on the bill is january , and it 's unclear whether the measure has enough support to pass .	the issue has roiled communities in wisconsin , including in the district of the bill 's lead sponsor , and across the country as more children identify as transgender at younger ages .	several school districts in wisconsin have their own policies , but rep. jesse kremer said a statewide policy is needed to protect them from lawsuits and create a unified standard .	wisconsin is one of a handful of states looking to become the first to restrict which bathrooms transgender students can use .	similar measures were defeated earlier this year in minnesota and nevada , while other states such as california and massachusetts are moving in the opposite direction and requiring schools to permit transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on the student 's gender identity .	the obama administration said in a friend-of-the-court brief filed last month that it 's against federal law to prevent transgender students from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identities .	during thursday 's education committee hearing , the president of an anti-abortion group said it is " inherently wrong " for schools to allow transgender students to share bathrooms with students who would be uncomfortable with that . "	it is a social experiment that borders on child exploitation , " said julaine appling of wisconsin family action , which supports the bill .	kremer has said the measure is in reaction to a situation in the kewaskum school district in which a student who was born female but identified as male repeatedly used a school bathroom for boys .	under his proposal , school boards would have to designate bathrooms and locker rooms as exclusive to one gender .	kremer , of kewaksum , said the proposal " encourages safe , private and dignified learning environment for all students , " and argued that the obama administration was trying to rewrite federal law to impose an agenda allowing a student to use any locker room they choose no matter their sex .	the bill defines gender as being " the physical condition of being male or female , as determined by an individual 's chromosomes and identified at birth by that individual 's anatomy . "	it would apply only to public schools , not private schools that accept students on taxpayer-funded vouchers .	mike mikalsen , spokesman for bill co-sponsor sen. steve nass , of whitewater , said the state would n't have jurisdiction over private schools despite the vouchers .	democratic state rep. sondy pope , of cross plains , questioned how a student 's gender would be determined , especially if it differs from how they were identified at birth . "	this just does not seem like a solid policy to me , " pope said . "	i would not want to be on your side of the table defending it . "	it 's unclear whether the bill will pass the legislature when lawmakers return in january .	republican leaders in the senate and assembly did not return messages thursday seeking comment .	gov. scott walker said in october that he thought there should be clarity in the law on the issue , but he has not commented specifically on the proposal .	his spokeswoman did not immediately return an email seeking comment .	wisconsin family action is the only group registered to lobby in support of the bill .	opponents include groups representing school boards and administrators , the american civil liberties union , the wisconsin coalition against domestic violence , the wisconsin council on children and families and the wisconsin school social workers association .

a naalehu physician fluent in marshallese is replacing a big island member of the state house of representatives who resigned for personal reasons .	gov. neil abercrombie announced friday that he appointed dr. richard creagan to the seat vacated by denny coffman .	the seat represents naalehu , ocean view , captain cook , kealakekua and kailua-kona .	coffman said last month that he planned to spend time with family as his daughter faces a medical issue .	the democrat was first elected in 2008 and served three terms in the legislature .	creagan was spending friday settling into his office at the state capitol and preparing for next week 's start of the legislative session .

wisconsin sen. russ feingold defended his vote for health care reform during a televised debate friday , and accused republican challenger ron johnson of wanting to replace the program with a system that puts insurance companies in control .	johnson , who calls the health care law an assault on personal freedoms , countered that the nation 's health care system was already the finest in the world , and needed only minor tweaks to become even better .	feingold had been considered a lock to win a fourth term , but recent polls show him slightly trailing johnson .	the two met in milwaukee for the first of three debates ahead of the nov. 2 election , and health care reform proved to be one of the more contentious issues .	while most congressional democrats who voted for the bill have downplayed their support , feingold said he was happy to help pass it . "	the big thing is , we finally get control of the insurance companies , " he said after the debate .	johnson has often said the main reason he entered the race was to help repeal the law .	he slightly modified his strategy friday , saying that since president barack obama would veto such an effort , republicans should be strategic and move to " replace and repeal . " "	if the republicans take over one of the houses of congress , they start writing the replacement bills from day one so we can show the american people , ' this is what we intend to do , ' " he said .	the new bills would start from tort reform , he added .	he also said he would keep the provision that prevents insurance companies from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions .	after all , he said , his adult daughter was born with a serious heart condition , and even now her heart is backward . "	every voter in wisconsin can be sure that i 'll protect people with pre-existing conditions , that they will be able to maintain coverage , " he said .	the businessman also targeted feingold for his support of the stimulus bill , which johnson said drove the country deeper into debt without providing the promised jobs .	johnson also repeated his assertion that global warming is n't a proven science and he played up his recent endorsement from the national rifle association .	feingold touted his maverick credentials , reminding voters he was the only democrat who voted against wall street reform ?	he said it did n't go far enough ?	and the only senator to vote against the patriot act .	he also criticized johnson for supporting trade agreements that feingold said will ship jobs overseas .	feingold and johnson will square off in their next debate monday in wausau .

is this time different ?	silvio berlusconi has survived prostitution scandals , howling gaffes , and seamy courtroom dramas ?	only to bounce back with a billion-dollar grin on his face .	italians have taken to shrugging away their leader 's misbehavior as the foibles of a man accustomed to " la dolce vita " ?	the sweet life that they themselves aspire to .	but the tale of ruby ?	an underage moroccan runaway whom berlusconi freed from police custody ?	has generated strong shudders that some predict could mark the beginning of the end of the media tycoon 's political career .	for one thing , the scandal appears to raise the bar even of berlusconi 's ample capacity for mischief-making : many see it as a clear-cut case of abuse of power that would have swiftly spelled the end of any other leader of a western democracy .	instead of being chastened , berlusconi shocked even the jaded italian electorate by declaring it 's " better to love beautiful girls than gays " ?	adding homophobia to accusations of anti-semitism stemming from the leader 's recent quips about the holocaust .	berlusconi has also seen his fragile center-right alliance slowly disintegrate over the past months ?	with his one-time key ally gianfranco fini now openly suggesting that berlusconi step down .	but while polls show his popularity is sagging and many see the ruby episode as " serious , " he retains much of his support among conservative voters while the opposition is divided . "	he may survive this one , but he 's getting weaker and weaker , " said franco pavoncello , professor of political science at john cabot university . "	this could n't happen in normal , advanced democratic republics . "	berlusconi has succeeded largely because people see in him a reflection of italian society itself .	and his comment about girls and gays taps into a deep sexist and homophobic streak that runs through the country .	but many even in his traditional support groups now feel he 's disgracing the nation . "	i 'm disgusted , " said anna sidozzi , 70 , in an age bracket that has generally backed berlusconi . "	i hope this last phrase about gays will help us to get out of the tunnel .	i feel ashamed . "	berlusconi argues that this is no time to bring down a government because of italy 's severe economic crisis .	critics say he 's being self-serving .	but it 's true that an election could leave the country divided and rudderless at a crucial time ?	a prospect many italians fear .	the latest scandal arose when berlusconi admitted he intervened to secure the release from police custody of the moroccan girl who had previously been at his villa outside milan .	the girl , known publicly only as " ruby , " reportedly told prosecutors she attended dinners at the villa but denied having sex with the premier .	the milan prosecutors office said after an investigation that the girl ?	who was picked up by police for alleged theft ?	had been correctly turned over to juvenile care .	but news media said wednesday that authorities are still investigating whether berlusconi 's original intervention was an inappropriate abuse of power .	berlusconi assured supporters this week that this government still had a majority and would last the remaining half of its five-year term .	but the climate is volatile , particularly after his split with fini , who said the premier has embarrassed the country .	respected political commentator sergio romano , in a front-page commentary wednesday in the leading corriere della sera newspaper , offered support for berlusconi .	he listed some of his government 's achievements , such as supporting overseas military missions and moves toward a federalist tax system , but also urged berlusconi to zip his lips and expressed hope the premier could reach a new accord with fini to end the political turmoil .	if not , he said , italy should return to the polls .	but berlusconi has shown no sign of toning down his rhetoric , blasting newspapers for publishing the stories about ruby and again attacking the judiciary , which he depicts as leftists seeking to destroy him . "	there is a boulder that weighs on this country .	the magistrates , " he said .	berlusconi has proclaimed his innocence in a number of investigations , including some that went to trial , over dealings in his sprawling business interests .	the premier , who jumped into politics in 1994 by creating his own conservative party , has either been acquitted or had charges dropped because of the statute of limitations .	but his coalition is now having troubling passing legislation that would shield him as a sitting premier from further legal woes .	berlusconi 's relationship with an 18-year-old would-be model from naples sparked a scandal last year that prompted his second wife to file for divorce .	soon after a call girl claimed she had spent a night with the premier and had tape recorded their encounter .	newspapers said wednesday that prosecutors have drawn up a report on alleged use of drugs and prostitutes at parties at berlusconi 's villa in sardinia and sent it to the premier 's home base in milan . "	the sooner he leaves , the better is , " said fabio natale , 42 , a consultant for a cell phone company . "	he 's mixing up the power his office gives him with his private interests .	he 's mixing up his duties with his rights . "

"	i took a watchmaking class when i came out of the service in 1946 , and i 've been doing it ever since , " said yax , whose family has been in the jewelry business in downtown howell for more than a century .	repairing watches and clocks is a skill whose time is almost past , yax acknowledges . "	in this age of quartz watches , there 's not much you can do other than replace a battery , " he said . "	when they go , they go . "	that means most of the watches he works on are valued collectibles and family heirlooms . "	people tell me they put some of the watches under glass after i 've repaired them , " he said .	yax conducts his repairs in a well-lighted room just behind the sales counter of his downtown business .	he draws his precision tools from a well-worn wooden box before beginning the process of disassembling the stopped watches and clocks . "	i 'll take them apart , clean them , then take a look for signs of wear , " he said . "	most of the problems come from wear .	people do n't maintain their clocks as they should . "	in most cases , timepieces can be repaired with little more than careful cleaning and lubrication . "	usually , we do n't see damage unless someone has tried to repair it themselves , " yax said .	just in case , yax keeps a stockpile of spare parts ?	some of which date back to when he was the junior partner in the family business .	his father , lawrence yax , founded the business now known as yax jewelers , in 1912 , and passed it to his son several decades later .	donald yax sr. eventually sold that store and founded his current business ?	less than a block down grand river avenue ?	in 1978 .	he passed it along to his son , donald jr. , better known as buss , about 25 years ago .

"	they had one of these in every room , " he said .	others , including glass-domed table clocks , were brought in by customers .	for grandfather and other large clocks , he 'll even make house calls .	yax prides himself on being able to repair even the most challenging cases . "	my favorite was a chiming ( pocket ) watch that sounded every 15 minutes , then sounded the hour , " yax said . "	that one took a lot of work . "	with skill and patience , he said , most watches can be fixed . "	they can pretty much be repaired unless they 're rusted , " yax said . "	then , it 's pretty much a no-go . "	like the items he repairs , yax intends to keep running for a good while longer . "	i 'm generally the first one in each morning , and i can go home when i feel like it , " he said . "	i usually do n't work tuesdays , but most other days , i 'm here . "

"	they moved out here because it reminded them of the land and rolling hills and the weather of germany where they came from , " he said .	jason bartelheimer 's father and uncle incorporated bartelheimer brothers dairy in the 1970s when they bought the farm from their father .	since then , huge changes have overtaken the family 's line of work .	in 1960 , snohomish county was home to an estimated 650 dairies .	by 1990 , there were 111 .	in 2010 , only 27 remain , according to figures from washington state university extension .	during the same half-century , the average number of cows per farm rose nearly tenfold , to 304 now , from 34 in 1960 .	in the current environment , large dairies with , say , 10,000 cows are able to compete , jason bartelheimer said , while mid-size farms like his family 's find it much tougher to stay afloat . "	we used to be considered a large farm and now we 're not large any more , " he said .	ned zaugg , skagit county wsu extension director , called the loss of the bartelheimer dairy " another dagger in the heart of the snohomish county dairy industry and a huge loss of income to many affiliated businesses in the area . "	high-quality feeds and care for their animals set them apart . "	they have been an icon of integrity and quality dairying throughout their history , " zaugg said .	jason bartelheimer said part of his family 's motivation was that his father , dale , is in his early 70s .	they do n't want to face prolonged financial uncertainty just as he 's hoping to retire .	they 're also faced with the expensive task of rebuilding a breached manure lagoon at the farm .	in april , the earthen lagoon broke , unleashing 27 million gallons of waste-laden water on adjacent farmland and the snohomish river .	some of it flowed into french slough , an arm of the river roughly 100 yards from the lagoon .	state and federal agencies determined that an oversight by a federal agency , and no fault of the farm , led to the break .	the failed lagoon was built in the 1990s .	any rebuilding would have to comply with current standards .	before starting work , they 'd have to run expensive seismic tests that might prevent them from putting a new lagoon there at all .	still , environmental regulations would pose little problem if milk prices were high , bartelheimer said .	the impending closure of one of the older and larger local dairies is a sad sign of the times , said jim werkhoven , a longtime dairyman in the tualco valley near monroe . "	you have a whole bunch of farmers who will be going to that sale on tuesday and a lot of them are going to be thinking , ' how much longer am i going to be in business ? ' "	werkhoven said . "	i personally have a lot more optimistic view long-term , but it 's going to take some time to get from here to there . "	werkhoven 's overview of the industry comes partly from his position as chairman of the board at the northwest dairy association , the co-op that runs darigold inc. .	things became especially difficult for local dairies when the export market for their products all but evaporated two years ago , he said .	then there 's been the increased use of corn for ethanol , which has driven up feed prices .	on top of that , reluctance by banks to lend money has been tough , because dairies are capital-intensive businesses .	last year there were times when milk prices failed to cover the cost of feeding the cows , werkhoven said . "	it has dramatically improved since then , but you 're dealing with a brave new world right now , " he said . "	you lose $ 900 per cow and that cow 's only worth $ 1,000 .	in one year 's time you 've basically lost the value of your herd ... and that 's what happened in 2009 . "	recovering from those losses takes years , he said .	when a farm closes , it has ripple effects on the surrounding economy .	the bartelheimer dairy employs eight to 12 people , depending on the season .	local businesses that sell feed and supplies are bound to suffer , too .	the bartelheimers might be getting out of the dairy business , but they hope their farm sticks around .	they have about 500 tillable acres they want to rent out .	jason bartelheimer hopes another dairy farmer might be interested .
a chopin ( shoh-pan ) man and teen have been arrested in connection with a july 2007 hate crime incident .	natchitoches parish sheriff victor jones said wednesday that 19-year-old christopher blake dubois , and a 16-year-old each were booked with a hate crime , terrorizing and aggravated assault with a firearm .	jones said the arrests conclude a federal investigation that led to the december conviction of justin sigler of natchitoches in federal court .	the charges are in connection with an incident reported in july 2007 , where dubois and the juvenile helped sigler dress as a kkk member and shout racial slurs at a biracial couple .	sigler was sentenced to 16 months at the end of the federal investigation .	the case against dubois and the juvenile was transferred to state court .
while the governor entertained john glenn at his official residence in a posh suburb , law enforcers planned to descend on a supplier of contraband tobacco skulking around the perimeter in an attempt to drop goods to a prison inmate working there .	it was a scene gov. ted strickland 's handlers just could n't fathom .	when they pieced together the scenario looming that january weekend , they called off the sting in a flurry that 's since been described by legislators as a " cluster " of such confusion it rivaled " hogan 's heroes . "	the public safety director in charge that weekend lost her job tuesday at the hands of the republican-led state senate , but the fallout is far from over for strickland , a democrat seeking re-election in a closely watched contest against former gop congressman john kasich .	a state inspector general 's investigation found that the now-ousted director , cathy collins-taylor , obstructed the probe and lied under oath .	though collins-taylor vigorously fought the findings , they had already made it by the end of last week into an anti-strickland commercial produced by the republican governors association .	investigators found strickland played no role in the winter weekend 's decision-making .	but their report concluded collins-taylor called off the sting to protect him from political embarrassment , not to protect his safety , as they had claimed .	the case has been forwarded to prosecutors for a possible follow-up .	it remains to be seen whether the scandal will stick to strickland , whose popularity has already suffered amid historic jobless rates , but governors are among the most vulnerable of democratic incumbents this year , said seth masket , a political science professor at the university of denver who follows issues surrounding governors . "	in the last two years , you had substantial downturns in just about all states .	governors are having to do more with less , and they 're being blamed not only for the economic hard times , but for the cuts they 've had to make in areas like education and social safety net services , " he said . "	throw in a scandal ?	it 's difficult to say . "	the inmate-worker program was begun almost a half-century before strickland took office in 2007 and allows low-risk inmates nearing release to perform tasks such as tending gardens , handling minor maintenance and staffing state dinners .	a probe by inspector general tom charles after the aborted raid found the inmates working at the home had ready access to hand tools such as knives , axes and chain saws and relatively free rein at the governor 's 3-acre property in bexley , a columbus suburb with million-dollar homes .	that mobility contributed to the problem with tobacco contraband , the report found .	loose leaf tobacco has fetched up to $ 300 a can and cigarette butts up to $ 25 behind bars since ohio prisons banned smoking last year .	inmates would pick up drops near a perimeter wall , stash them in a bathroom ceiling and take them via body cavity back into prison .	a huge stash of tobacco was found on the site after the sting was made public and .	but prisoner misbehavior is in some ways only a minor element .	the inspector general 's report said high-ranking public safety officials called off the sting to avoid embarrassing strickland as the governor and his wife hosted a dinner that sunday night with glenn , a former u.s. senator and the first american to orbit the earth ; his wife , annie ; strickland chief of staff john haseley ; and haseley 's 8-year-old daughter .	safety authorities learned about the contraband operation from an intercepted letter that told them the woman planned to drop a delivery the night of the dinner , the report said .	the package was to be picked up later by an inmate and delivered to pickaway correctional institution south of columbus , the report said .	the public safety officials gave the unconventional directive to find the woman and warn her off , the report found .	she was never arrested . "	i am saddened that i will not continue to work with this agency and continue the path i started , " collins-taylor said in a statement after her confirmation was dramatically rejected . "	but most of all , i am saddened that recent events have overshadowed the work being done at the department each and every day . "	strickland has said that he believed officials acted in good faith but that anything meant to spare him embarrassment was unnecessary .	his detractors paint it as further evidence for their arguments that he has overly centralized and politicized ohio government .	an ad launched friday by the governors association criticizes him over the economy and includes a woman saying , " i read that his aides lied to investigators . "	before collins-taylor was accused of playing politics to " protect the boss , " as one e-mail she wrote put it , his human services director had stepped down amid accusations she improperly accessed government information on samuel wurzelbacher ?	the man who came to be known during the 2008 presidential debates as " joe the plumber " ?	in an effort to discredit him .	but strickland stood behind collins-taylor amid the sting controversy , spending precious political capital headed into the november election and taking a risk by sending her up for confirmation .	the governor 's nominees for the post generally begin work upon appointment , and they are rarely rejected .	she was among a notable number of women in his cabinet ?	they make up a full half , including the directors of development , insurance and workers ' compensation .	female lawmakers of both parties raised collins-taylor 's gender as an issue in how she was treated during the scandal .	with a stint as a prison psychologist among his credentials , strickland has stood behind ohio 's work program for inmates at the residence .	he expanded the number of low-risk prisoners participating and in 2008 thwarted an effort by corrections officials to beef up the program 's security .	it is not the first time a governor has grappled with controversy involving such programs .	then-south dakota gov. bill janklow 's skirting of rules was blamed for allowing two female inmates to hold a clandestine party at his state residence in 2000 .	janklow won his bid for congress that year .	in south carolina , then-gov .	jim hodges fired his prisons director in 2001 after guards allowed inmates working at his official residence to have sex in the basement .	hodges lost his re-election bid the following year to mark sanford ?	who shared kasich 's credential as a former congressman .

u.s. rep. david wu tried monday to reassure constituents following reports about his odd behavior on the campaign trail and concerns over his mental health .	wu took questions from a largely sympathetic audience at the washington county democratic central committee , four months after an angry address to the group prompted a complaint from a democratic activist and fueled concerns among staff that wu needed psychiatric care .	seven staff members resigned following wu 's re-election in november .	the seventh-term democrat from portland thanked the group of party activists for hard work that he said helped secure his win last year and helped boost democratic gov. john kitzhaber to a narrow victory .	he listened praise of his courage to speak publicly and was greeted with two standing ovations .	but he also fielded questions from weary voters .	michael crabbe , of beaverton , wanted to know how wu planned to talk with voters about his health following more than two weeks of reports about his inappropriate behavior . "	you 're answering the bell for us tonight , " crabbe told wu . "	i need to hear from you how you 're going to answer the bell from the voters in district 1 . "	wu responded that he 's reached out through the media and plans to continue holding meetings in his district to talk face-to-face with constituents .	robert seward , a retired physician from forest grove , wanted to know specifics about wu 's mental and physical health and the treatment he 's received . "	this whole issue is your fitness to command , your fitness to be our congressman , " seward said . "	the burden of proof is on you to show us that you 've had an evaluation and you 're fit . "	wu said he 's had a physical since the election and that wright would be impressed with his doctor 's reports .	crabbe and seward both said afterward that they felt more comfortable that wu was capable of serving them in congress , but seward would still like to know more specifics about wu 's last psychiatric evaluation . "	i feel a lot better about him than i did before , " seward said . "	he 's going to the voters .	that takes courage .	that takes openness . "	but dennis rychlik , of hillsboro , was less convinced .	he felt wu was more careful about hiding details than he was about revealing them .	he wants to know when wu last had a mental health exam and the precise reasons his staffers resigned . "	this did n't settle anything for me , " rychlik said .	earlier in the day , wu spoke briefly at the washington county public affairs forum in hillsboro .	he told about 50 people that he 's capable of doing his job and took responsibility for his " inappropriate " behavior . "	i am very capable of taking care of my constituents here in oregon , very capable of discharging the obligations that you have entrusted me with in the last election , " wu said .	wu has said he will run for re-election , and the reports about his mental health have forced him to get an unusually early start on his bid .	he spent the weekend crisscrossing his district in northwestern oregon , which is home to a number of high-tech firms and some of the largest employers in oregon , including intel and nike .	he also previewed a campaign message , declaring himself " the education guy " and a leader in science and technology policy .

the woman who intervened when an officer pulled over one of her sons , leading to a racially-charged scuffle that set off the 1965 watts riot , has died .	rena price died of natural causes june 10 in los angeles , her son wendell price told the los angeles times ( http://lat.ms/12hwwfy ) .	she was 97 .	on august 11 , 1965 price rushed from her home in south los angeles to a nearby traffic stop where a white california highway patrol officer had pulled over her son marquette frye .	accounts vary on what set off the scuffle , but a patrolman hit frye on the head with a baton , his mother jumped on another officer , tearing his shirt , then another officer pulled out a shotgun .	a growing crowd witnessed police arrest price , frye and his brother ronald , who was a passenger in the car .	after rumors spread that police had roughed up a black woman , angry mobs formed and six days of rioting raged across the city .	thirty-four people were killed , more than 1,000 injured and hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed .	the riot exposed deep fractures between blacks and an overwhelmingly white law enforcement community .	after the fryes ' names appeared in news accounts about the riot 's inception , most of the family began using the last name price , which belonged to the father of one of her children , her son wendell told the times .	marquette was arrested dozens of times after the riots and died of pneumonia in 1986 , when he was 41 .	price also struggled , telling the times decades later that nobody would hire her after the arrest .	she was found guilty of interfering with police officers ?	a misdemeanor ?	and was given a 30-day jail term which was later reduced to two years ' probation .	in 1966 an appeals panel reversed her conviction , citing prejudicial remarks the prosecution had made to the jury blaming price and her sons for causing the deadly riots .	as time passed , price eventually found work and moved past the events of 1965 , especially after they were eclipsed by the more destructive 1992 riots . "	what was the name of that king guy ?	rodney ?	you hear more about that than the '65 riots , " she told the times in 2005 . "	oh , it 's been years .	i 'm through with it .

"	kids like to skate .	it 's a place for them to go and meet and be safe . "	the building dates to 1947 , but the roller skating business has been in bentzinger 's family for 75 years .	her late father , john scott , and his brother albert scott started in business together upstairs on the carthage square , then went their separate ways and opened their own rinks .	albert 's descendants have scottie 's skateland in quincy .	john and his late wife millie operated the crystal ball .	bentzinger ran the business for her mother after her father died in 1975 and took it over after her mother 's death in 2001 .	the next generations , bentzinger 's children and grandchildren , now are involved .

fred anderson , a tenor saxophonist known for having a smooth , velvety playing style and a chicago club that was considered one of the cradles of contemporary jazz , has died .	he was 81 .	his sons , eugene and michael anderson , said their father died thursday , but they declined to provide additional details .	anderson , a native of louisiana , performed in relative obscurity for years , saying he was determined to stay in chicago and help foster cutting-edge jazz instead of going to new york or elsewhere .	he took odd jobs until he opened the velvet lounge in 1982 , naming it after someone 's praise for his playing style . "	the idea was to keep young musicians going ... ( so ) they could develop their music here before taking it out to the world , " anderson told the associated press in 2006 . "	those who come through here learn how to listen and how to play with each other ?	which is very difficult .	that 's how jazz has developed from the beginning . "	he kept the club going almost single-handedly for decades as owner , sometimes bartender and resident mentor .	at times , anderson did everything from collecting the $ 10 cover charge to jamming on stage to taking out the garbage .	in deference to his influence , some artists have gone so far as to refer to the club as fred anderson university .	dozens of acclaimed albums have been recorded at the club , including 2005 's " blue winter , " featuring anderson , drummer hamid drake and bassist william parker .	performers typically made a modest amount of money compared with what other clubs paid .	but anderson never considered money the point .	instead , he believed the goal was to give aspiring musicians a place to hone their skills and to experiment playing harder-edged , freewheeling jazz that posh , more commercially minded jazz clubs tended to shun .	anderson rose to prominence in the 1990s , when music companies began to release recordings of his work to favorable reviews and he became a regular on the jazz-festival circuit in the united states and europe .	in 2006 , anderson described what he called the most difficult task of his life : moving the club to a new location and watching as crews bulldozed the much-beloved venue to make way for a housing complex .	velvet lounge devotees helped raise money to help anderson move the club half a mile away .	forty years ago , anderson joined other black artists in founding the association for the advancement of creative musicians , a groundbreaking group dedicated to reviving a faltering 1960s jazz scene in chicago .

"	the state does not know when college costs too much to be affordable for state residents because there is no definition of higher education affordability , " auditors write in an audit released as part of the legislature 's november interim meetings . "	cost management for higher education is not emphasized . "	auditors listed five recommendations for the state higher education policy commission to consider .	the recommendations range from developing specific affordability measures to creating a policy governing cost-controls at the state 's public colleges .	the audit said lawmakers established an affordability target in 2000 , but evidence suggested that between 2000 and 2008 higher education became " less affordable for state residents and that an increasing cost burden has been placed on students through rising tuitions and fees . "	the total cost to attend a four-year college increased by 34 percent between 2004 and 2009 , the audit said .	financial aid is not keeping pace and only about one-fifth of low-income students attend college .	a marshall student could pay $ 4,360 to go to school in 2007 .	in 2009 , the cost was $ 5,236 .	the lowest increases at a four-year college were at fairmont state university , where rates went up 7 percent over the past three years .	at west virginia university , tuition increased 12 percent in three years .	the legislature has capped the average increase each year over four years at 7.5 percent .	auditors said the increases can be tied to stagnant state funding for public colleges and universities .	since 2002 , the state 's support of higher education grew by 3.22 percent .	at the same time , inflation grew at a rate of 27.2 percent .	in 2002 , tuition and fees covered about 46 percent of costs .	by the 2008-09 school year , it had grown to nearly 62 percent .	now , nearly 70 percent of four-year college students have to borrow money to go to college .	and as students borrow defaults rates are climbing .	about 7.5 percent of students who borrowed to go to a four-year college defaulted on their loans .	at community colleges , 15.3 percent eventually defaulted .	the national default rate is 7 percent .	bluefield state college and west virginia state university have default rates over 10 percent .	auditors found that the state 's northern community college has a default rate of 21.3 percent ; southern and eastern have default rates of 17.9 percent ; and new river has a default rate of 17.5 percent .	the state higher education policy commission has been reviewing college costs since the summer of 2009 .	a report is expected next month .
los angeles county voters have approved a measure requiring porn performers to wear condoms while filming sex scenes , prompting a pledge by the adult entertainment industry to sue to overturn the measure .	with 100 percent of the county 's precincts reporting , measure b passed 56 percent to 44 percent in tuesday 's election .	the measure requires adult film producers to apply for a permit from the county department of public health to shoot sex scenes .	permit fees will finance periodic inspections of film sets to enforce compliance .	the aids healthcare foundation , which sponsored the initiative , says the measure will help safeguard the public , as well as porn workers , from sexually transmitted infections .	but the adult film industry , which is largely centered in the san fernando valley in suburban los angeles , says the requirement is unnecessary since the industry already polices itself by requiring performers to undergo monthly tests for hiv and other infections .	the industry also says the requirement would damage it since porn viewers will not watch sex scenes with condoms , and force adult film producers to relocate to where they can make movies that will sell .	on wednesday , the free speech coalition , a trade group representing the adult entertainment industry , said it plans to file a lawsuit to overturn the condom requirement on constitutional grounds .	in a letter sent to the county board of supervisors , the industry also requested that it be involved in discussions as to how the county will implement the requirements .	it will also explore moves to neighboring states as soon as possible , the coalition said .	the aids healthcare foundation says the issue is a public health and safety issue , not a free speech issue .

"	currently , washington has both a presidential primary and a caucus system .	the cut would not affect the top-two primary for other races .	a statewide presidential primary had been established in 1989 after voters approved an initiative , but the state 's political parties , especially the democrats , have largely ignore it , preferring to choose their candidates in caucuses of the party faithful .	in 2008 , the republican party appointed about half of its delegates from the statewide primary , said peter graves , spokesman for the state republican party .	while comparably small to others , the $ 10 million cut from the secretary of state 's office is part of the governor 's all-cuts budget to tackle a projected deficit of $ 5 billion in the next two-year budget .	the primary has been suspended in the past , in 2004 .	reed , a republican , said his office has lost 28 percent of its budget , adding that the elections department has gone down from 22 workers to 10 . "	this is our budget cut .	as much as i hate to do it , that is what we 're advocating , " reed said .	the proposal , though , spurred some concerns from the democratic and republican parties .	both parties are lobbying lawmakers to delay the decision of the suspension until after april , saying the state would not lose any money by delaying it until then . "	right now , we 're reevaluating whether we 're going to elect delegates via the caucus process or not , " said cody arledge of the democratic party , adding that there were many complaints in 2008 with the system .
billionaire investor carl icahn said thursday he will try to buy all of the outstanding shares of cvr energy inc. through a tender offer , if the petroleum refiner 's board refuses to put the company up for sale .	the $ 30-per-share offer represents a 6.7 percent premium over the company 's wednesday closing stock price of $ 27.60 .	the news sent cvr shares up $ 1.60 , or 5.8 percent , to close at $ 29.20 in heavy trading thursday .	the offer also includes a " contingent value right , " that would entitle holders to an additional cash payment if the company is eventually sold for more than $ 30 per share .	icahn also said that he plans to nominate a slate of candidates to fill the nine director positions on the company 's board , setting up a proxy fight .	the activist investor said he still believes that the company should be put up for sale .	if that does n't happen before the tender offer expires in late march , icahn said he will go forward with the offer and a proxy fight in an attempt to get shareholders to back the sale of the company .	icahn is known for buying and shaking up struggling companies , with mixed success .	he said thursday that if the company were to be put on the market , it would draw interest from major oil companies .	icahn said he plans to start talks with some of those buyers and expects cvr to sell for at least $ 37 per share .	icahn said the tender offer is contingent on his slate of nominees being elected so they can eliminate cvr 's " poison pill " measure , which is intended to ward off unwanted attempts to acquire the company .	about 36 percent of the shares will need to be tendered in order for icahn , who already owns a stake in cvr , to take control .	based in sugar land , texas , cvr energy owns a refinery in coffeyville , kansas , and markets fuel in central kansas , oklahoma , western missouri and southwest nebraska .	a spokesman for cvr did not immediately return a call and an email seeking comment .
georgia 's largest school district will soon find out if it won a prestigious national prize for urban education .	gwinnett county schools is one of five public school districts nationally competing for the broad prize .	the districts will find out oct. 19 if they win .	the districts could win up to $ 1 million in scholarship money for high school seniors , with $ 250,000 going to runners-up .	it 's the second year in a row gwinnett county , which has 150,000 students , has been nominated for the prize .	the prize , created in 2002 by the eli and edythe broad foundation in los angeles , is designed to reward schools for narrowing the achievement gap between minority and white students , increasing graduation rates and improving student performance for low-income students .
lawrence resident paul kincaid says the embarrassment of defeat led him to choose dentistry as a career more than 60 years ago .	kincaid , 90 , said his high school in braymer , mo. , did n't have an organized track team .	nonetheless , one saturday a school bus drove around town and picked up students who wanted to compete in the county track meet .	he got on the bus . "	when i got there , i decided to do hurdles , " he said . "	i thought it looked easy . "	kincaid fell over the first hurdle and landed on the cinder track .	the embarrassed teenager got up and tried to " get lost " in the crowd .	instead , he ran into an old friend and they started talking about what they wanted to do after they graduated .	his friend said he wanted to be a dentist , work for 25 years and then retire . "	i thought that sounded good , " he said .	after graduation , kincaid attended three years at william jewell college in kansas city , mo. , and then entered the university of missouri-kansas city school of dentistry , graduating in june 1945 .	his friend , however , did n't go to dental school . "	he became a school superintendent , " he said .	kincaid 's dental office has operated continuously for 66 years , and according to the kansas dental board , he is the longest active practicing dentist in kansas .	he continues to work half-days monday through thursday .	each evening , he calls patients who have undergone procedures that day to ask how they are doing .	when kincaid was a dental student , he worked in the laboratory at the school .	a lawrence dentist who used the laboratory told kincaid he could make enough money to pay his rent by working two hours a day as a contract dentist for haskell indian nations university in lawrence .	at the time , kincaid was making $ 225 per month working at the lab .	kincaid , who had a wife and young son by this time , said he visited the dean and told him he had a chance to be a contract dentist in lawrence .	the dean noted he would earn more money if he set up his own dental practice .	so , kincaid went into debt $ 3,000 to purchase furniture and used equipment and set up a dental office over bunny black 's shoe store at 8391/2 massachusetts st. the office had two operating rooms and no air conditioning .	in 1953-54 , during the korean war , kincaid served in the u.s. army and was stationed at an army disciplinary barracks in new cumberland , pa. .	a dental school classmate came to lawrence and ran his office during his absence .	when he returned to lawrence , kincaid moved from massachusetts street to a bungalow office at 306 e. 23rd st. , near haskell indian nations university .	in 1956 , dentist phil falkenstein joined his practice .	they worked alongside each other for about 30 years .	kincaid said he was thrilled when his youngest son , charley kincaid , joined the practice 35 years ago .	his other son , paul kincaid jr. , is a chiropractor in oskaloosa .	today , kincaid dental clinic has about 15 employees , including five hygienists and three dentists .	dental assistant cheryl cooper has been with the practice for 45 years , while hygienist jane getto has worked there for 35 years .	in 1983 , kincaid and his son charley received a letter from his pastor saying he thought it would be a good thing if they joined a mission to haiti sponsored by the east kansas conference of the united methodist church .	it would be the first of three trips the dentists would make to the poverty-stricken country . "	we mainly did extractions , " he said . "	we pulled 800 teeth in five days . "	in addition to the kincaids , the team included a pediatrician who tended to children with diseases , a veterinarian who talked to residents about how to take care of their animals and an agronomist who talked to farmers about crops .	kincaid 's efforts in haiti earned him the paul harris award from the lawrence rotary club .	kincaid , a prostate cancer survivor who enjoys woodworking , said his wife , mary bess , died earlier this year .	being able to work with staff and visit with longtime patients at the dental office has helped filled the void of that loss . "	we 're friends , " he said of his staff and patients . "	we 're almost relatives now . "	kincaid said he has no desire to retire . "	i 've retired already ?	for one day , " he joked . "	i came back the next day . "
the sponsor of a bill to allow guns on college campuses abruptly withdrew the bill more than an hour into the debate on allowing concealed handguns into college buildings and classrooms , state sen. jeff wentworth asked that debate resume on monday .	he apparently did not have enough votes to move it forward .	several republicans asked for amendments to the bill .	the bill lets texas concealed handgun license holders , who must be 21 years old and pass a training course , bring their weapons on campus .	the measure has met stiff resistance from higher education officials .	supporters call it a key gun rights issue and critical self-defense measure .	texas would become the second state , following utah , to pass such a broad-based law .	colorado gives colleges the option and several have allowed handguns .
india announced the successful test launch thursday of a new nuclear-capable missile that would give it the ability to strike the major chinese cities of beijing and shanghai for the first time , a significant step forward in its aspirations to become a regional and world power .	the agni-v missile , with a range of 5,000 kilometers ( 3,100 miles ) , still requires a battery of tests and must clear other bureacratic hurdles before it can be inducted into india 's arsenal .	but officials hailed the launch as proof the country has taken its place among the world 's most powerful and scientifically advanced nations . "	the nation stands tall today , " defense minister a.k. antony said , according to the press trust of india .	the test came just days after north korea 's own failed rocket launch , but sparked none of the same global condemnation aimed at pyongyang , an internationally isolated regime that has been banned by the u.n. from testing missile technology .	video released by the government showed the agni-v taking off from a small launcher on what appeared to be railroad tracks at 8:07 a.m. from wheeler island off india 's east coast .	it rose on a pillar of flame , trailing billows of smoke behind , before arcing through the sky .	the missile hit an altitude of more than 600 kilometers ( 370 miles ) , its three stages worked properly and its payload was deployed as planned , the head of india 's defense research and development organization , vijay saraswat , told times now news channel . "	india has emerged from this launch as a major missile power , " he said .	the chinese government did not immediately comment on the missile launch .	state-owned china central television called the test " a historic moment for india and it shows that india has joined the club of the countries that own ballistic missiles . "	the state broadcaster then enumerated some of the missile 's shortcomings , from a problem with guidance systems to its 50-ton-plus weight , which it said would require it to be fired from fixed , not mobile positions and thus make it more vulnerable to attack . "	it does not pose a threat in reality , " cctv said .	the agni-v is a solid-fuel , three-stage missile designed to carry a 1.5-ton nuclear warhead .	it stands 17.5 meters ( 57 feet ) tall and was built almost completely with indian-made technology at a reported cost of 25 billion rupees ( $ 486 million ) .	it can be moved across the country by road or rail and can be used to carry multiple warheads or to launch satellites into orbit .	prime minister manmohan singh hailed the launch as " another milestone in our quest to add to the credibility of our security and preparedness and to continuously explore the frontiers of science . "	the missile will need four or five more trials before it can be inducted into india 's arsenal at some point in 2014 or 2015 , indian officials said .	china is far ahead of india in the missile race , with intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in india .	currently , the longest-range indian missile , the agni-iii , has a range of 3,500 kilometers ( 2,100 miles ) and falls short of many major chinese cities . "	at the moment there is a huge assymetry in china 's favor , " said c. uday bhaskar , the former head of the institute of defense studies and analyses .	after it inducts the missile into its arsenal , however , " india 's deterrent profile in the region would be appropriately burnished . "	india hailed thursday 's test as a major step in its fight to be seen as a world power . "	india has today become a nation with the capability to develop , produce , build long-range ballistic missiles and today we are among the six countries who have this capability , " saraswat said .	analysts say france , russia , china and the united states have this technology , while israel is also believed to have developed such missiles .	others were more cautious .	defense analyst rahul bedi said much needed to be done , noting that a government that is notoriously slow with defense decisions now needs to push forward with more tests , work out strategic doctrines , define targets , figure out manufacturing issues and how many missiles to build among a host of other issues . "	we need to build on today 's success ... to build in a very capable dissausive deterrence capability , " he said . "	but going back to past records i do n't know if we can sustain it . "	india and china fought a war in 1962 and continue to nurse a border dispute .	india has also been suspicious of beijing 's efforts to increase its influence in the indian ocean in recent years .	india already has the capability of hitting anywhere inside archrival pakistan , but has engaged in a splurge of defense spending in recent years to counter the perceived chinese threat .	the indian navy took command of a russian nuclear submarine earlier this year , and india is expected to take delivery of a retrofitted soviet-built aircraft carrier soon .	the new agni , named for the hindi word for fire , is part of this military buildup and was designed to hit deep inside china , bedi said .	government officials said the missile should not be seen as a threat . "	we have a declared no-first-use policy , and all our missile systems , they are not country specific .	there is no threat to anybody , " said ravi gupta , spokesman for the defense research and development organization , which built the missile . "	our missile systems are purely for deterrence and to meet our security needs . "	the test came days after north korea 's failed long-range rocket launch .	north korea said the rocket was launched to put a satellite into space , but the u.s. and other countries said it was a cover for testing long-range missile technology .	one delhi-based western diplomat dismissed comparisons with the international condemnation of north korea 's launch , saying that pyongyang was violating u.n. security council resolutions requiring it to suspend its missile program , while india is not considered a global threat .	the diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on india 's security affairs .	in washington , state department spokesman mark toner said the united states urges all nuclear-capable states to exercise restraint regarding nuclear capabilities . "	that said , india has a solid non-proliferation record , " he told a news briefing . "	they 're engaged with the international community on non-proliferation issues . "	associated press writer matthew pennington in washington contributed to this report .
coal interests that a veteran environmental regulator says played a role in his forced resignation have contributed about $ 50,000 to republican gov. john kasich since he took office ?	a fraction of the well-funded politician 's re-election campaign haul .	the industry 's larger financial investment over the past three years appears to have been in the gop-dominated state legislature , where associates of the state 's two most powerful coal firms ?	boich cos. and murray energy ?	have directed nearly $ 170,000 since 2011 , according to an associated press review of state campaign finance filings .	state lawmakers hold sway over the state 's clean energy quotas and other environmental laws .	george elmaraghy , a 39-veteran of the ohio environmental protection agency , said in an email widely distributed last week that his departure was being forced by kasich and ohio epa director scott nally after " considerable pressure " from the coal industry .	elmaraghy headed ohio epa 's division of surface water , which issues permits for mining and other activities . "	because of the industry 's interpretation of the federal clean water act and state water pollution control laws , dsw staff worked under difficult conditions but you have done your jobs honorably , " elmaraghy wrote .	the administration declined to discuss elmaraghy 's personnel situation but defended the integrity of ohio epa 's permitting program .	nally rejected a request thursday by elmaraghy to reverse his resignation , which elmaraghy says was forced .	data compiled by the nonpartisan national institute on money in state politics show coal companies and executives , energy companies operating coal-fired power plants in the state and others have donated more than $ 500,000 to kasich 's state campaign coffers ?	the bulk of that coming during the 2010 election cycle .	kasich has amassed political contributions totaling more than $ 5.3 million since 2011 , of which just under $ 50,000 came from interests that could readily be identified as having a coal interest .	the institute found about $ 35,000 came from electric utilities , the other $ 15,000 from mining .	boich and murray executives and family members also have given $ 27,000 to the state republican party , and wayne boich jr. gave $ 10,000 to the national federation for independent business since 2011 , records show the head of an association representing ohio 's coal industry rejects the idea that coal companies ?	or their campaign contributions ?	might have played a role in elmaraghy 's resignation . "	the ohio coal association does not have any influence over personnel decisions made by state agencies , " president zane t. daniels said . "	we have and will continue to work with state and federal regulators on a day-to-day basis to ensure we 're operating within the perimeters of the clean water act . "	jed thorp , a former ohio epa employee who now heads the state chapter of the sierra club , said he is prone to believe elmaraghy . "	having worked over there for five years , i 'm inclined to take him at this word , " thorp said . "	i just heard ( murray energy ceo ) bob murray complain to the legislature about the epa not issuing permits in a timely manner a few weeks ago .	i 've spoken with all sorts of people over there in the division .	the consensus is that 's probably why he was let go . "	the sierra club is among the state 's most politically generous environmental groups , giving some $ 3,000 to legislative candidates since 2011 .	it wields its most significant influence on the national stage .	its super pac contributed $ 1.2 million directly to candidates and did $ 1.9 million in outside spending in 2012 , according to data compiled by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics .	in that year , boich and murray made political donations of $ 1.9 million , all to candidates , the center calculated .	kasich spokesman rob nichols said criticism surrounding elmaraghy 's departure was being fueled by " the democrat political attack machine . " "	fortunately for ohio , their style of politics does n't rule the day anymore , " he said . "	what does rule the day is the administration 's common sense approach to energy , which seeks a balanced fuel mix for ohio : coal , gas and alternatives .	that can help keep prices low and , with sound regulations , protect people and the environment . "	he said " environmental extremists " want policies that will cost eastern ohio coal mining families jobs .	republican strategist terry casey said the philosophical tug of war between industry and environment goes back a long way in ohio . "	politically , al gore lost badly in 2000 in eastern and southern ohio over some of these economic issues and questions , " he said . "	some have debated whether people and their jobs are more important and valued than some salamanders in a creek in eastern ohio .	and how much are consumers willing to pay in higher electric costs to satisfy the environmental desires by some interest groups ?

"	it 's good to come home today .	it helps me a lot , " hall said . "	it lets me know they support me a lot .	they are not worried what i look like or how i will act .	they are just happy for me to be here .

egyptian officials say the death toll from a train crash south of cairo has risen to 26 , after two of the injured died in hospital .	the train slammed into at least three vehicles , including a truck , crossing the tracks early on monday near the village of dahshur .	most of the dead and injured were family members returning from a wedding in cairo .	the head of egypt 's emergency services , ahmed el-ansari , says 28 people remained in hospital , mostly with fractures , crush injuries and lost body parts .	egypt is notorious for train collisions and has a poor safety record blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment .	a year ago , a train crashed into a bus , killing 51 school children in southern egypt .
numerous speakers told a state senate committee tuesday that they oppose the rapid increase in railcars carrying crude oil from the bakken fields of north dakota and montana through the state .	the senate energy , environment and telecommunications committee met in spokane , a major railroad hub for the northern united states , to take testimony on a bill that seeks to improve the safety of those oil shipments .	but nearly all the members of the public who spoke attacked the measure as too friendly to the oil and railroad industries .	numerous people referred to last year 's explosion of a rail car in quebec , canada , that killed 47 people , and worried that could happen in washington . "	i personally do n't believe we should send these ' bomb cars ' through our community of almost half a million people , " said mike petersen of the lands council , a spokane environmental group .	an explosion like the quebec blast would be catastrophic in downtown spokane , where elevated railroad tracks run near or adjacent to office towers , hotels and hospitals , speakers said .	but officials of the bnsf railway noted there has n't been a rail accident involving hazardous materials in the spokane region in decades , and said rail traffic is getting safer .	patrick brady of bnsf said the railroad has had one flammable release this year in 900,000 shipments of hazardous material . "	it 's pretty rare for them to occur , " he said .	the oil boom in north dakota and montana has created a sharp increase in rail shipments to west coast refineries and ports .	there were no crude oil shipments by rail through the state in 2011 , but that increased to 17 million barrels in 2013 and is projected to reach 55 million barrels this year .	that has raised concerns in communities across the state about a derailment and explosion in a populated area .	a bill to regulate crude oil shipments failed in the legislature last year , but senate bill 6582 will be introduced in the next session .	the measure calls for the state department of ecology to study the safety of the shipments .	it also seeks to train emergency responders , and create caches of emergency gear in rail communities .	it would be funded by an extension to rail of a 5-cents-per-barrel tax that currently applies only to oil shipments by sea . "	we want to prevent something catastrophic , and to be prepared if something happens , " said state sen. mike baumgartner , r-spokane , a sponsor of the bill .	baumgartner noted the state 's ability to regulate the shipments is limited because interstate commerce is a federal issue .	critics of the bill included katie evans , of the local chapter of the sierra club , who said it spends too much money on accident response and not enough on accident prevention . "	we want a moratorium on any increase in crude oil shipments , " she said .	bonnie mager of cheney worried that if an oil tanker exploded near her home , " we 'd be incinerated . "	other speakers complained that bnsf should be forced to use only the most up-to-date rail cars for the shipments , and should be required to alert local leaders when shipments are coming through their towns .	kari cutting of the north dakota petroleum council told lawmakers that rail tankers are safe to contain the bakken crude , which is not more volatile than other crude oil .	but she acknowledged there was no way to ensure that an accident did not punch a hole in a tanker car . "	you ca n't reach zero percent probability , " she said .	she said about 40 percent of the oil shipped by rail is transported in older cars that are not as safe as newer models .	johan hellman of bnsf said about 5 percent of the railroad 's cargo was crude oil .
traffic deaths fell slightly in wisconsin in february .	twenty-eight people died during the month , eight fewer than last year and four fewer than the five-year average .	sixty-nine people had died this year by the end of february , also down from a year ago .	state transportation officials say the numbers are preliminary .	they 're still determining if all the deaths were directly caused by crashes .
ingredients for success : with three quarters of the states now dominated by one party or the other ?	the highest ratio in recent history ?	candidates from the opposition often seem to have little chance on election day , unless they have chutzpah ?	and a lot of money .	not so fast : it 's still tough to buck the dominant party trend .	in democratic-leaning california , republican meg whitman , who built a fortune as ceo of ebay , resoundingly lost the 2010 governor 's race despite spending $ 140 million of her own money .

south carolina 's technical colleges are getting more flexibility on tuition as they deal with state funding cuts .	the greenville news reported the governing board of the state 's technical college system agreed tuesday to give the local schools more choices on tuition .	students have paid a flat rate , even if they took more than the 12 hours each term to be designated as full-time students .	greenville technical college president keith miller says the school is considering three options .	one option would be to change nothing .	the second would add a fee to students who take more than 12 hours .	the third plan would charge all students by the number of hours in each course , regardless of the number of courses taken .	the new options would apply starting in the fall term .
a longtime morris county freeholder has been removed from office by a state appellate court .	the panel took the action tuesday after ruling that a lower court judge erred in declaring that margaret nordstrom had won the republican nomination over challenger hank lyon .	the panel also voided nordstrom 's win over her democratic opponent in the november elections and declared her freeholder seat vacant .	lyon had defeated nordstrom by four votes in the gop primary in june .	but nordstrom sued and lyons win was overturned .	nordstrom was later chosen as the party 's nominee during a special convention attended by county gop officials .	the appellate panel said it did n't have the authority to appoint lyon to the freeholder board .	instead , republican leaders will likely hold another special convention to fill the vacancy .
the first phases of a reimagined fantasyland at florida 's walt disney world , the new cars land at california 's disneyland based on the " cars " movies , and universal studios hollywood 's new transformers ride top the list of new attractions at theme parks across the country in 2012 .	and thrill ride enthusiasts wo n't be disappointed , with at least 20 new roller coasters debuting at parks from maryland to california .	disney says the renovation and new construction at fantasyland inside the magic kingdom in florida is the largest expansion project in the park 's 40-year history , doubling the size of the current fantasyland .	part of it ?	including one of what will eventually be dueling dumbo rides and the rethemed barnstormer family roller coaster ?	opened in april .	much of the construction is still in the middle stages , but disney says most of the new elements will be open in time for the winter holidays this year , with the rest opening later .	it 's going to include new " attract-areas " ?	immersive mini-parks that include attractions , restaurants and retail ?	built around the stories of " snow white " and " beauty and beast , " as well as a new dark ride based on the adventures of " the little mermaid . "	replacing snow white 's scary adventures in fantasyland will be princess fairytale hall , where visitors will be able to interact with all the disney princesses . "	the opportunity to greatly expand and relaunch fantasyland , which has been largely unchanged since 1972 , is just a huge opportunity , " tom staggs , chairman of disney parks and resorts , told the associated press earlier this year . "	every time i go down and look at the progress in construction i get more excited about it . "	industry consultant dennis speigel said the fantasyland expansion with detail-oriented areas immersing guests in disney-themed worlds is expected to pay dividends for years , much like the hugely successful harry potter mini-park at universal orlando , where visitors feel like they 've been dropped right into meticulously decorated movie sets . "	it 's a big deal , " speigel , president of cincinnati-based international theme park services , said of the fantasyland project . "	it 's the largest expansion ever in the history of the park .	the last number we heard is that it 's approaching $ 500 million ... parks have realized it takes more than a space mountain by itself or one ride and attraction .	it has to have a combination of all the elements now . "	in june , disneyland california adventure is opening cars land , replicating the town of radiator springs from the movies , including a race-course ride and two other new little-kid-friendly attractions .	universal studios hollywood in los angeles is expected to debut the new transformers ride ?	a dark ride with motion-simulator vehicles inspired by the science fiction action film ?	on friday ( may 25 ) , with gates opening early memorial day weekend ( starting at 7:30 a.m. saturday ) due to expected interest in the ride .	on may 8 , universal orlando introduced a daily interactive character parade and nighttime pyrotechnics show celebrating universal 's 100 years of making movies .	a new 3-d ride based on the " despicable me " movie will open at universal orlando sometime this summer .	in april , seaworld orlando opened a new attraction centered on sea turtles , including a first-of-its-kind 360-degree domed theater showing a 3-d movie about the endangered creatures .	legoland , which opened in october in central florida , is renovating and reopening an existing water park at the site in time for the summer season .	busch gardens tampa bay this spring rolled out an elaborate ice show called " iceploration , " which features everything from bombastically costumed skaters to real live exotic birds flying around the indoor theater .	the show tells the story of a kid who , with the help of his wise grandfather , puts down his electronic devices and discovers the natural wonders of the world .	and entering the cool indoor theater for the 30-minute show will undoubtedly be a welcome respite for park visitors in the heat of the florida summer .	the international association of amusement parks and attractions trade group reports 135 new attractions opening this year , including water parks , rides and shows , spokeswoman colleen mangone said .	among those are 20 new roller coasters . "	it 's almost like timing is everything , " mangone said . "	and in 2012 we 're seeing short-term and long-term projects coming to fruition at the same time , which certainly should create some great thrills at amusement parks . "	among the new coasters debuting are manta at seaworld san diego , which will simulate underwater flight ; and superman-themed launch coasters at six flags discovery kingdom in vallejo , calif. , and six flags magic mountain in valencia , calif. .	six flags great america in gurnee , ill. , introduces a new coaster called x-flight , in which two riders sit side-by-side with their feet dangling , experience a 12-story drop and turn upside down five times .	hersheypark in hershey , pa. , introduces a 200-foot-tall coaster called skyrush , which will reach speeds of 75 mph and includes five zero-g airtime hills .	dollywood in pigeon forge , tenn. , opened the 210-foot-tall wild eagle coaster in march .	busch gardens williamsburg in virginia unveils a half-mile-long indoor-outdoor coaster called verbolten .	apocalypse at six flags america in largo , md. , is a 100-foot-tall stand-up coaster , and the stinger at dorney park & wildwater kingdom in allentown , pa. , is a scorpion-themed boomerang-style coaster that features six inversions and face-to-face seating .	based on attendance trends and season-pass sales , speigel said the theme park industry is expected to see 7 percent growth or more this year , which is much better than expected .	he attributes it to the number of new attractions , an improving economy , pent-up demand and other factors .
the candidate most responsible for keeping u.s. senate hopeful and lt. gov. david dewhurst from winning an outright majority in the texas primary ?	former dallas mayor tom leppert ?	is now in dewhurst 's corner , but it still might not be enough .	the mainstream gop favorite , dewhurst earned more than 44.5 percent of the vote for the republican nomination to replace retiring sen. kay bailey hutchison on may 29 ?	besting tea party favorite ted cruz by 10-plus percentage points .	but he fell about 700,000 votes short of avoiding a july 31 runoff .	round 2 of balloting may well be decided by about 21 percent of texas republicans who voted for neither dewhurst nor cruz , choosing one of the race 's seven other gop senatorial candidates .	enter leppert , who took about 13 percent of the primary vote and endorsed dewhurst late tuesday night .	the lieutenant governor was also previously endorsed by fourth-place finisher craig james , a former nfl running back and espn commentator . "	the endorsements are going to create some excitement and help get voters out , " dewhurst spokesman matt hirsch said wednesday . "	it definitely gives us momentum heading into the last two weeks . "	but there 's some evidence that cruz has seized the momentum with the runoff now just 13 days away ?	he raised about $ 200,000 more than dewhurst between may 10 and the end of june , and motivated voters have given him a slight edge in some public opinion polls .	leppert 's endorsement could change that , though many of his supporters might have flocked to dewhurst anyway .	leppert campaigned on his decades of experience directing companies large and small before running for mayor , and promoted fiscal conservative values ?	but not at the expense of occasional compromise between republicans and democrats .	dewhurst owns an energy company and has a personal net worth of over $ 200 million .	he says he 's a conservative fighter , but has also occasionally compromised with democrats to pass key legislation while heading the texas senate since 2003 .	cruz , a former ivy league debate champion and the son of a cuban immigrant , is the former state solicitor general .	he strikes a more populist tone , vowing never to back down from the kind of staunchly conservative values popular with grassroots organizations .	leppert made his announcement in dramatic fashion ?	appearing unexpectedly with dewhurst just moments after a dewhurst-cruz debate in dallas .	further explaining his endorsement on 660-am in dallas the following morning , leppert said he spoke with both sides but decided to give the nod to dewhurst because of his business background . "	he 's actually been out there , created jobs , seen the successes and failures of business , understands ?	not from a theoretical standpoint from a practical standpoint ?	what tax policy does to investment , what regulation does to creating jobs , " leppert said .	he added , " that 's the experience that we do n't have .	we 've got a lot of people who have made great speeches , but it has n't given them experience . "	cruz has n't issued any response to the endorsement , except to offer mild congratulations to dewhurst .	but his campaign spokesman , james bernsen , said wednesday it likely would n't result in a major bump for dewhurst . "	it 's not surprising that david dewhurst received another endorsement from the political establishment , " he said .	dewhurst also has endorsements from gov. rick perry and many top gop state lawmakers , solidifying his role as the establishment party 's favorite .	cruz , meanwhile , is backed by tea party superstars like south carolina sen. jim demint and former alaska gov. sarah palin .

a first-of-its-kind statewide review found instances of voter fraud in ohio during last year 's presidential election but not rampant abuses , the elections chief in the battleground state said thursday .	republican secretary of state jon husted said the investigation he ordered in january by ohio 's 88 county election boards resulted in 135 substantiated cases being referred to law enforcement for further investigation out of 625 reported cases of voting irregularities .	that included 20 individuals husted was referring to ohio attorney general mike dewine on thursday who appear to have registered and cast ballots in both ohio and another state .	they included a man who voted in person in both ohio and kentucky on election day and a woman who cast an absentee ballot in virginia then voted in person in ohio . "	voter fraud does exist , but it 's not an epidemic , " husted said .	while noting that fraud cases represented a tiny fraction of the 5.6 million ohio votes cast last year , husted said he wanted to send a message that even one instance of fraud is unacceptable . "	if you cheat , you will get caught and we will hold you accountable , " he said . "	to the vast majority of voters who did it the right way in the state of ohio ?	and i say the vast majority of voters ?	your vote will not be diluted by the people who have cheated . "	most of the 135 cases were caught before fraudulent votes were counted , husted said .	fraud was detected through cross-checks with voter records in 21 other states working to protect election integrity , he said .	husted said boards of elections were also instructed to look for voter suppression , but no cases were documented of voters being denied ballots and no referrals were made ?	a finding questioned by democratic state rep. kathleen clyde of kent .	she said she knew of at least 52 voters whose ballots were n't counted in tuscarawas county alone " and i can direct him to voters ' sworn testimony to prove it . "	clyde said she was pleased overall that husted 's review found the system works . "	i hope this process shows the secretary 's fellow republicans in the legislature that there is no need to revive the photo id bill that died last general assembly , " she said . "	i also hope the secretary 's office will turn its attention to investigating real problems such as the 208,000 provisional ballots cast in 2012 , the 34,000 rejected provisional ballots in 2012 , and the ongoing problems complying with the federal motor voter law . "	husted said he hoped the review would provide facts to counter " a lot of pre-election hyperbole " ohio voters face each election season , including allegations of systematic scheming by voter groups and political campaigns , students , illegal aliens and others . "	in the aftermath of the election , time after time when things calm down , these issues go away , and then no one revisits them again until the next major election , " he said . "	what i wanted to do in the aftermath of the election was to get the facts . "	husted said he anticipated different political factions would interpret the findings in different ways ?	describing the policy issue as " finding the correct balance between access and accuracy . "	he said it looks to him as if ohio has struck a good balance .	substantiated fraud involved double voting , voting for other people ?	including those who had died , and voting from an address from which the voter was n't eligible .	husted said photo id " would n't have mattered in most of these cases " but he would use the experience to lobby for more technological advancements in the area of voter tracking .	more than half of states are not part of the interstate crosscheck program through which duplicate votes and registrations were found .	husted said he was ordering a further review thursday of voters registered to a u.s. postal service or commercial mailbox storefront address .	under ohio law , a voter can receive mail at such an address but must list a residence for voting purposes .

"	we have a pretty open-door policy as far as who can go on the trips , " filardi said .

with chicago election officials printing mayoral ballots that include rahm emanuel 's name , it 's up to the illinois supreme court to decide whether voters will actually see him among their choices during next month 's election .	the state 's highest court agreed tuesday to decide whether emanuel can run for mayor , and the justices ordered election officials not to print any ballots without his name until they can rule .	the action bought valuable time for the former white house chief of staff , who a day earlier was kicked off the ballot by an appeals court because he did n't live in the city for a year before the feb. 22 election .	the state supreme court said it would expedite the matter but gave no specific time frame .	with less than a week to go before the first early ballots are cast , a number of potential scenarios loomed , including the possibility that emanuel would have to resort to a write-in campaign or wage a desperate bid to take the matter to federal court .	emanuel , who had been the heavy favorite to lead the nation 's third-largest city , pressed ahead with confidence and said he was doubling his campaign by adding more stops to his already busy schedule . "	i am clear that i think that we will succeed because of the thoroughness of our argument , " he said tuesday at an event where he received an endorsement from the teamsters .	he said he was " more determined to see this through so the people have a right to make the choice for themselves . "	until october , the former chicago congressman had been living in washington working for president barack obama .	the high court was to review legal briefs and would not hold oral arguments , a sign the justices want to decide the case quickly .	that plan is " absolutely a reflection that they understand the tightness of the time schedule , " said dawn clark netsch , a professor emeritus at northwestern university 's law school .	chicago election officials said they had printed nearly 300,000 ballots without emanuel 's name before they abruptly stopped .	the board of elections had hurriedly authorized the printing after monday 's appellate ruling . "	things are changing in an unprecedented fashion , " board chairman langdon neal said .	if the supreme court does not put emanuel back on the ballot , he could consider a write-in campaign .	he would have to declare himself a write-in candidate by feb. 15 .	emanuel has declined to say whether he would entertain such a drastic step .	he also has refused to say whether he would consider other legal remedies , such as finding a way to get his case into the federal courts , possibly all the way to the u.s. supreme court .	but netsch said there was little chance the matter could make the leap to federal court .

continued improvement in the state economy means iowa is likely to collect $ 48.6 million more in taxes during the current budget year than previously expected , a state budget panel said friday .	overall , the state is now expected to collect more than $ 6.6 billion during the budget year that ends june 30 , an increase of 3.9 percent compared to the previous budget year , the three-member revenue estimating conference estimated .	the panel also said it expects state tax collections to increase by another $ 38.3 million next fiscal year .	those estimates reflect continued improvement in the economy , with growing employment and the addition of 11,000 jobs .

"	it 's a victory for common sense and plain meaning , " said jim yavorcik , an attorney representing a bluffton player who was severely injured in the march 2 , 2007 , crash .	the baseball team was making an annual spring training trip to florida when the bus flipped off a georgia overpass and plunged 30 feet onto interstate 75 .	investigators said the bus driver thought he was staying in an hov lane when he drove onto an elevated ramp just north of atlanta , plowing through a stop sign at highway speed .	the driver and his wife were killed , along with the five student athletes .	twenty-eight others were injured .	the bus company had $ 5 million worth of coverage , which was insufficient to pay all the claims resulting from the crash , yavorcik said .	the ohio supreme court ruling has the potential to provide up to $ 16 million in additional coverage , he said .	attorneys for the insurance companies did not immediately return calls for comment on tuesday .	the two supreme court justices who were not part of the majority opinion said bluffton had not " hired " the bus because the bus company selected the vehicle and employed the driver . "	the majority 's narrow interpretation expands the scope of coverage beyond what the parties to the insurance policy intended , " justice evelyn lundberg stratton wrote in her dissent .

some people who saw jeremy mcdole , 28 , in the days before he was killed wednesday said he did not appear to be sad or to be acting strangely . "	when i saw him , he was happy , " said bishop anthony slaughter , a community evangelist who talked to mcdole last monday .	eugene smith , an uncle who said he spoke with mcdole about 15 minutes before the shooting , also said he did not sense anything unusual .	court records reviewed by the associated press show mcdole , who had at least 16 arrests , expressed suicidal behavior in 2010 and was accused of being combative with law enforcement .	in pleading guilty in 2011 to a drug charge , mcdole was given a form asking him several questions , including whether he had ever been a mental hospital patient .	his public defender responded affirmatively , adding in parentheses : " 2010 suicidal . "	public defender kester crosse also indicated mcdole was taking the antidepressants cymbalta and zoloft at the time of the plea .	a criminal history form included in another of mcdole 's case files noted that he " will resist police . "	the file shows that mcdole had a juvenile adjudication for resisting arrest and other crimes in 2004 , and that he was charged with resisting arrest in connection with a 2009 drug charge .	the latter resisting charge was dropped in a plea deal .	in that incident , a police officer wrote that mcdole repeatedly pulled his arms away from officers trying to take him into custody , and fought with officers after arriving at a police station . "	do n't disrespect me ! "	he shouted as officers tried to prevent him from putting his hands in his crotch area , according to the report .	law enforcement officials also said in court records that mcdole , who was shot in the back by an associate in 2005 , used his wheelchair to hide things . "	the last three felony arrests indicate that mr. mcdole has used his disability to enhance his opportunities to become a better drug dealer , as since his shooting incident he can hide contraband easier in his wheel chair , " a probation and parole officer wrote in october 2014 .	wilmington police say they encountered mcdole , who was black , on wednesday after receiving a 911 call about man who had shot himself in the parking lot of an auto parts store and was still armed with a handgun .	officials have released a portion of the call , in which a frantic woman repeatedly says the man still has a gun and warns other people to stay back .	cellphone footage taken by a bystander shows police repeatedly telling mcdole to drop his weapon and mcdole reaching for his waist area before shots erupt .	authorities have said they recovered a .38 caliber handgun near mcdole 's body .	repeated attempts by the associated press to talk to the mcdole family were unsuccessful .	family members have previously suggested that he did not have a gun , and that police had no reason to kill him .	wilmington police chief bobby cummings has said he does not know whether mcdole was depressed or suicidal , or what might have led him to shoot himself before police arrived .	slaughter , the community evangelist , said he told mcdole on monday that he would pray for him . "	he said , ' i 'm done doing anything crazy . '	... he wanted to change his life , " slaughter recalled .	delaware gov. jack markell and mayor dennis williams , who attended a peaceful prayer vigil and spoke with mcdole 's family on thursday , met relatives again sunday . "	the governor made a brief visit to jeremy mcdole 's grandmother to offer condolences and thank her for working with the naacp to try to maintain calm , " markell spokeswoman kelly bachman said in an email .	the delaware naacp is seeking an independent probe of the shooting , which is being investigated by police and the state attorney general 's office .
a baton rouge lawmaker withdrew her anti-bullying proposal wednesday after the house education committee gutted it , taking out any reference to the type of activity that would be banned .	the proposal has become an annual flashpoint over the rights of gay students , and both the jindal administration and the conservative louisiana family forum opposed the bill by rep. patricia smith in its original form .	bullying of students is prohibited in current louisiana law , with school boards required to include such bans in student codes of conduct and determine punishment .	smith , d-baton rouge , proposed rewriting the state 's anti-bullying statute to spell out that harassment and intimidation would not be allowed for race , ancestry , national origin , religion , disability , sexual orientation , gender identity and other listed factors .	opponents said the list would create favored and protected classes of people .	the committee stripped the list in a 10-5 vote , so smith shelved the bill . "	members , rather than you degrade a bill that was meant for safety for children , which is what you 've just done by this amendment , i am pulling the bill , " smith told the committee .	teachers and parents of students who were bullied pleaded with lawmakers to pass smith 's original bill , saying teachers , school counselors and other education leaders need more guidance and training on what constitutes bullying and harassment .	tiffany phelps , executive director for an arts school , described the suicide of 17-year-old student tesa middlebrook , who hanged herself in march from her high school 's football bleachers .	phelps , urging passage of smith 's original bill , told lawmakers wednesday that middlebrook was " bullied relentlessly . " "	when she would get off the bus every day , she would shake .	she was scared to death .	we reported it .	we reported it to the right people .	her friends reported it ... nothing happened , " phelps said , her voice breaking .	she told the committee , " i beg you , i beg you to please , please , please vote yes . "	critics of the original proposal said it could be deemed an unconstitutional restriction on free speech and could face legal challenges because terms like " abusive " and " harm " were n't clearly defined .	gene mills , head of the louisiana family forum , said the bill would n't treat all children equally and would introduce sexual politics into the classroom . "	you 're creating categories and levels of protection that are favorable to some but not equitable to all , " mills said .	during debate , education committee chairman steve carter continually urged people to speed their testimony , including parents describing their child 's suicide and others describing bullying incidents .	carter , r-baton rouge , was attending a jindal bill signing shortly after his committee ended with the shelving of smith 's bill .	the house has rejected similar anti-bullying measures in recent years .	last year , the house watered down and then rejected the bill after an angry debate in which opponents claimed the measure was an attempt to promote a " gay agenda " in schools .	bill proponents said they are trying to protect children and that intolerance should n't be supported in schools . "	children in our schools today should never feel like that they are not safe at a place where they spend six hours a day , and far too often that is not the case , " smith said .	louisiana 's current law leaves gray areas where teachers and principals are n't told what constitutes bullying , rather than simple teasing , she said .	several speakers talked about children who struggled through school amid repeated harassment because they were disabled , were gay or wore a head scarf reflecting their religious beliefs . "	one of the bullies was given an award for being an outstanding student , " said adrienne critcher , of shreveport , who talked of her son 's harassment because he is gay .	rep. jeff thompson , r-bossier city , said while he agreed to require teacher and school personnel training about how to recognize bullying , he could n't support the list . "	when you start creating a list of the motives of something , you 're going to leave something out .	and if you leave something out , you 're going to create a loophole , " thompson said .	smith could try to revive the proposal , but wednesday 's vote appeared to make it unlikely she could get it through the full legislature in its original form .

the man who planted a car bomb in times square boasted that he thought it would kill at least 40 people and that he planned to detonate a second bomb two weeks after the first , prosecutors said wednesday , quoting the former financial analyst in a video where he said he 'd hoped " to join my brothers in jihad " ever since the sept. 11 attacks .	faisal shahzad should get life in prison when he is sentenced oct. 5 , prosecutors said in a filing , arguing that he " had every intention of delivering a powerful and terrorizing strike to the heart of new york city . "	the government noted that shahzad showed no remorse when he pleaded guilty on june 21 after confessing to investigators .	in fact , prosecutors wrote , " he spoke with pride about what he and his coconspirators had done . "	included in the government submission to the sentencing judge in u.s. district court in manhattan was a 40-minute video in which shahzad fires a machine gun in what appears to be the mountains of pakistan as he announces that he has met members of the pakistan taliban and has decided " we are going to raise an attack inside america . "	prosecutors also included a video of the government 's explosion of a bomb the size of shahzad 's , saying the results last june in a pennsylvania field show the attack would have been " devastating to the surrounding area " had it succeeded .	through most of the first video , shahzad is seated and quoting from the quran but makes his intentions clear toward the end when he states : " i have been trying to join my brothers in jihad ever since 9/11 happened .	i am planning to wage an attack inside america , " prosecutors said .	shahzad was arrested two days after his may 1 bomb attempt in tourist-filled times square , where the explosives he had packed into the back of a sports utility vehicle sputtered and failed to detonate .	prosecutors said he tried to ignite the bomb before he abandoned the vehicle and that he was " prepared to conduct additional attacks until he was captured or killed . "	the government did not list other locations that shahzad might have chosen as targets .	the second video shows an explosion shot from various angles , sometimes in slow motion .	it caused a giant fireball that ripped apart the mock car bomb and five other vehicles positioned around it to simulate traffic .	it also sent debris flying into a nearby pond .	a lawyer for shahzad did not immediately return a request for comment wednesday .	shahzad chose a warm saturday evening to carry out his attack in a part of times square he believed would be most crowded based on streaming video of the world-famous tourist magnet that he 'd looked at online , prosecutors said .	he lit the fuse of his bomb , then left the vehicle to head to grand central terminal and , from there , his connecticut home , pausing along the way to listen for the explosion that never came , the filing said .	a street vendor spotted smoke coming from the suv and alerted police , who quickly cleared the area .	the bomb attempt set off an intense investigation that culminated two days later with investigators plucking shahzad off a dubai-bound plane at a new york airport .	the government made clear that much of its information came from shahzad , who waived his right not to incriminate himself .	prosecutors quoted extensively from the video that they said was posted online by the pakistan taliban on july 14 , titled " a brave effort by faisal shahzad to attack united states in its own land . "	prosecutors said the video , which includes publicly released photographs taken in times square following the attempted bombing , includes a segment in which shahzad explains that " jihad is one of the pillars upon which islam stands " and later advises that " jews and christians have to accept islam as a religion and if you do n't do that , then you are bound to go in hellfire . "	the pakistan-born shahzad , 30 , pleaded guilty to 10 terrorism and weapons counts , some of which carry mandatory life sentences . "	i want to plead guilty and i 'm going to plead guilty a hundred times forward , " he said .	he defiantly called himself a muslim soldier at the proceeding and warned that unless the u.s. leaves muslim lands alone , " we will be attacking u.s. , and i plead guilty to that . "	he admitted that the pakistan taliban provided him with more than $ 15,000 and five days of explosives training late last year and early this year , months after he became a u.s. citizen .	then , he said , he built his fertilizer-fueled bomb packed in a gun cabinet , with a set of propane tanks and gas canisters rigged with fireworks to explode into a fireball .	he also revealed that he was carrying a folding assault rifle , which he said was for self-defense .	prosecutors said in their court document that shahzad had practiced firing the gun at a range in connecticut " to ensure he was fully prepared if confronted by law enforcement authorities . "	prosecutors noted the irony of shahzad 's plans to attack the united states , where he 'd succeeded academically and professionally over the past decade and created a life with his wife and two young children that was " full of promise . "	they said that much of his personal success was built on opportunities the u.s. had provided , including the chance to earn a college degree while on a student visa and permission to remain in the country on a working visa sponsored by a u.s. company .	he lived comfortably with his family in connecticut until he chose " a nihilistic path that celebrated conflict and death cloaked in the rhetoric of a distorted interpretation of islam , " prosecutors said .	they added : " the premeditated attempt to kill and maim scores of unsuspecting innocent men , women and children with a homemade bomb can only be described as utterly reprehensible . "

an idaho conservation group is pressing ahead with a federal lawsuit challenging the bonneville power administration 's plan for managing winter water levels in the state 's biggest lake .	the idaho conservation league initially filed the lawsuit in 2012 , but after months of negotiations has been unable to reach a settlement with bpa over winter pool levels and fluctuations at lake pend oreille .	the icl renewed the case recently by filing a brief with the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals asking the court to force bpa scientists to do more rigorous study of its flexible winter power operations plan , according to a story published wednesday by the bonner county daily bee ( http://bit.ly/1asfffo ) .	that plan allows the lake pool to be fluctuated within a 5-foot range up to three times each winter to maximize power generation at the albeni falls dam located on the pend oreille river .	icl contends the plan , which is already in effect , speeds up shoreline erosion , destroys ecologically-rich wetlands and pollutes the lake with silt .	icl attorneys say the bpa violated the national environmental policy act by doing an environmental analysis instead of a more thorough environmental impact statement and failing to take a required " hard look " at the proposal using up-to-date analyses .	the dam inundated and destroyed 6,000 acres of high-value wetlands when it was completed in 1957 and made the clark fork , pack and priest river deltas vulnerable to erosion .	bpa is still grappling with compensating for impacts caused by construction of the dam .	the agency has yet to take up mitigating the operational impacts of the dam .	meanwhile , erosion is chewing into the clark fork delta by as much as 15 acres a year , and icl officials believe the flexible winter operations plan exacerbates the problem . "	water is a powerful force of erosion and manipulating lake pend oreille like a yo-yo will erode shorelines , threaten wetlands and add more silt into this treasured lake , " brad smith of icl said . "	at the very least , we need to look before we leap , when it comes to this precious natural resource . "	a bpa spokesman declined to comment on the litigation . "	we 're currently reviewing the brief and we 'll be preparing our own response for the court , " said kevin wingert of bpa .

"	the governor 's push came the same day advocates both for and against the tax cap gathered in albany .	a pro-cap rally quickly devolved into a back-and-forth shouting match tuesday morning , with opponents chanting " tax the rich " while lawmakers tried to voice their support for the bill .	soon after things wrapped up , the two sides argued their case on the floor of the legislative office building - at times loudly and inches apart - as reporters snapped photos and television cameras rolled .	opponents of a cap have pushed for a " circuit breaker " approach , which would limit property-tax rates for low - and middle-income taxpayers .	ron deutsch , executive director of new yorkers for fiscal fairness , said the circuit breaker is the choice of the people , and the only way to provide meaningful relief . "	the reality is what the governor is talking about is increasing taxes for people on an annual basis , " deutsch said . "	so if i ca n't afford my property taxes now , what good is a tax cap going to do me ?	only a circuit breaker would help me in that situation . "	assemblywoman ellen jaffee , d-suffern , rockland county , was critical of a tax cap , calling it a " sound bite , not sound policy " at an anti-cap press conference .	her concerns echo those of many county , municipal and education leaders , who have said a cap without relief from mandate costs would spell trouble for local governments ' finances . "	it is a policy that is a recipe for disaster in our education system , and in our municipalities in new york state , " jaffee said . "	it does not provide tax relief , and while we all recognized the need for property-tax relief , we need to move forward with the appropriate legislation that will actually offer that . "	but assembly speaker sheldon silver , d-manhattan , told reporters tuesday he has no plans to take up circuit-breaker legislation .	senate republican leader dean skelos said he supports a hard cap , with no exemptions for pensions , health care or other expenses .	the senate passed cuomo 's tax-cap proposal in january , but the democrat-led assembly has been reluctant to take it up .	assembly democrats plan to reveal a compromise bill in the coming days that will cap taxes at 2 percent , but will include some exemptions , silver told reporters tuesday . "	we are finalizing the bill , " silver said . "	we 've briefed the governor on it .	he 's aware of it , and we will introduce it one of these days . "	silver declined to discuss the specifics of his conference 's proposal , but some assembly democrats said last week that talks had centered around allowing the bill to expire in three to five years and exempting pension costs from the cap .	skelos said tuesday his conference will " look at it " if cuomo decides to " weaken " his proposal , but reiterated senate republicans ' support a hard cap . "	the governor has been very clear , and we stand with the governor , that he wants a hard property-tax cap , " skelos said .	but speaking with reporters after presenting his agenda in syracuse , cuomo said the bill must pass both houses for the senate to claim success . "	if the tax cap passes and people have tax relief , then government will have done its job , " cuomo said . "	if a tax cap does n't pass , government will have failed .	it 's that simple .	to me , it 's binary . "

there were a raft of hazards and regulatory failures at a contaminated ground zero tower where two firefighters died , but that 's not a reason to toss out manslaughter charges against three construction company figures who worked there , a judge ruled friday .	the ruling puts the case on course for trial as soon as january .	mitchel alvo , salvatore depaola and jeffrey melofchik ?	the only people criminally charged in the deadly august 2007 blaze at the former deutsche bank building ?	have pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and other charges .	prosecutors say the men knew about , failed to fix and even covered up a break in a crucial firefighting water conduit , called a standpipe , and that was a critical factor in the firefighters ' deaths .	the men , who were working to dismantle the toxic tower , say they were unfairly blamed for a fire fueled by others ' failures .	they asked a court earlier this year to dismiss the charges .	manhattan state supreme court justice rena k. uviller noted that the raging fire was a result of a range of actions and inaction , from a worker 's careless smoking to the fire department 's failure to conduct required inspections .	but the allegations against alvo , depaola and melofchik represent enough of a role in the tragedy to sustain their indictments , she wrote . "	although there were several factors contributing to these fatalities , the grand jury reasonably inferred that defendants ' conduct in dismantling the standpipe and the failing to take corrective action was an actual contributory cause of the deaths , " uviller wrote .	melofchik lawyer edward j.m. little declined to comment on the ruling but said his legal team was " looking forward to the trial , when our client jeff melofchik can finally have his day in court . "	depaola 's lawyer , rick j. pasacreta , said he was confident depaola would prevail at trial .	alvo 's lawyers had no immediate comment ; nor did prosecutors .	the world trade center 's south tower collapsed into what was then a bank building across the street on sept. 11 , 2001 .	the impact heavily damaged the bank building and filled it with toxic debris .	a laborious process of dismantling the now government-owned building has taken years .	on aug. 18 , 2007 , a construction worker 's discarded cigarette sparked a fire that tore through several stories of the building .	firefighters contended with a roster of hazards , including deactivated sprinklers , stairwells that had been blocked to contain toxic debris , an air system that was supposed to control toxins but ended up concentrating smoke , and the broken standpipe .	with the standpipe severed , it took 67 minutes for the firefighters to get water by other means to fight the blaze .	firefighters robert beddia and joseph graffagnino became trapped on the burning 14th floor .	they died of smoke inhalation after their oxygen tanks ran out .	the standpipe had broken during asbestos removal work in the building 's basement in november 2006 , manhattan prosecutors say .	alvo , the director of abatement for project subcontractor john galt corp. , and depaola , a galt foreman , ultimately had a 42-foot-long section of the standpipe cut up and removed from the building , according to prosecutors .	melofchik , the site safety manager for general contractor bovis lend lease , filled out checklists saying the building 's fire suppression equipment was working despite the broken standpipe , prosecutors say . "	while ( the three men ) choose to point their fingers at other entities who they claim bear responsibility for the deaths of the two firefighters , this case is about these defendants and their actions that caused two deaths and nearly caused numerous others , " assistant district attorney noah d. genel wrote in court papers in may .	defense lawyers say the men did n't realize the pipe was a standpipe ?	and they note that a raft of inspectors never flagged it .	regardless , the attorneys argue , the broken standpipe was n't the key cause of the firefighters ' deaths .	they point to the many other perils and oversights that prosecutors and city officials have acknowledged . "	why are they scapegoating a few defenseless people at the bottom of the line ? "	little asked uviller at a hearing in july .	when the case was unveiled in december 2008 , then-district attorney robert morgenthau pointedly said there was blame to go around among the maze of government agencies and companies that had worked at the building during its dismantling .	the city agreed to fire safety reforms , and bovis agreed to pay the firefighters ' families $ 10 million in a memorial fund .	if convicted , alvo , 58 , depaola , 56 , melofchik , 48 , could face up to 15 years in prison .	galt also faces the same charges and has pleaded not guilty .	the company is seeking a separate trial .

a woman in washington state died from measles in the spring ?	the first measles death in the u.s. since 2003 and the first in the state since 1990 , health officials said thursday .	the woman lacked some of the measles ' common symptoms , such as a rash , so the infection was not discovered until an autopsy , washington state department of health spokesman donn moyer said .	this is the 11th case of measles in washington state this year , moyer said .	it follows an outbreak of measles at disneyland in california late last year , which sparked an intense debate around america about mandating vaccinations for schoolchildren , which some parents oppose .	measles is highly contagious and spreads when an infected person breathes , coughs or sneezes .	however , dying from it is extremely rare , moyer said .	officials did n't say whether the woman was vaccinated , but they did note she had a compromised immune system .	they withheld her age to protect her identity but said she was not elderly .	the woman was hospitalized for several health conditions in the spring at a facility in clallam county , which covers the northern part of the olympic peninsula .	she was there at the same time as a person who later developed a rash and was contagious for measles , moyer said .	that 's when the woman most likely was exposed .	she was on medications that contributed to her weakened immune system , he said .	an autopsy concluded the cause of death was pneumonia due to measles . "	this tragic situation illustrates the importance of immunizing as many people as possible to provide a high level of community protection against measles , " moyer said . "	people with compromised immune systems can not be vaccinated against measles .	even when vaccinated , they may not have a good immune response when exposed to disease ; they may be especially vulnerable to disease outbreaks . "	the last active case of measles in washington was reported in late april .	it 's possible to develop measles within three weeks of exposure .	since three weeks have passed since the last measles case , no one who had contact with the known cases is at risk , moyer said .	this case was not related to the measles outbreak at disneyland , which started in december and sickened more than 140 people across the country and in mexico and canada , moyer said .	no deaths resulted from that outbreak .
a man was arrested tuesday after his unruly behavior aboard a southwest airlines flight from los angeles to kansas city compelled the flight crew to make an emergency landing in texas .	ali reza shahsavari , 29 , of indialantic , florida , has been charged with interfering with a flight crew , said patrick rhodes , amarillo 's aviation director .	he was booked into the randall county jail in canyon , texas , where he awaited an appearance before a magistrate .	flight 3683 landed without incident and the man was taken into custody for questioning by federal officials .	none of the 136 passengers and five crew members was injured , and the aircraft resumed its flight after a security sweep , said brad hawkins , spokesman for the dallas-based airline .	initially , authorities said the man had tried to break into the cockpit but rhodes later said he was " not trying to break into the cockpit , but was unruly and had confronted the cabin crew . "	passenger doug oerding told the amarillo globe-news that shahsavari started screaming obscenities at other passengers during the flight .	flight attendants attempted to calm shahsavari and then he went to the bathroom at the back of the plane and started making a commotion , oerding said .

a maine farmer is headed for a legal showdown for ignoring state law and following a local ordinance that exempts farmers from state and federal regulations if they sell their products directly to consumers .	dan brown , owner of gravelwood farm in blue hill , was issued a three-count civil summons last week for selling milk and other food products without state licenses from his farm stand and at farmers ' markets .	blue hill is one of five towns where voters passed local ordinances this year allowing small-scale farmers like brown to bypass state and federal regulations on foods sold directly to consumers .	the attorney general 's office has issued an opinion stating the local laws were pre-empted by state and federal laws , thereby making them invalid .	brown is the first farmer in those communities who 's been cited for not following state agriculture laws since the local ordinances passed , said bob st. peter , who owns a farm in sedgwick and heads a group called food for maine 's future , which advocates local food control .	the outcome of brown 's case likely will set a precedent on the legality of the local ordinances , he said . "	i think if dan loses this suit and the state is able to require licenses from him , then anybody in our ordinance towns will be forced to comply , " st. peter said . "	that 's a concern to people . "	brown declined comment wednesday , saying he needs to hire a lawyer first .	but he 's put a video on facebook and youtube in which he said he 's been selling milk and other products without a license for a couple of years ?	even before the local ordinance was passed in blue hill ?	without any problems . "	i did n't change what i was doing , " brown says in the video . "	they changed the rules . "	maine agriculture commissioner walt whitcomb , who is a dairy farmer and sympathizes with small-scale farmers , said regulatory oversight is critical when it comes to food safety and public health .	state inspectors in the past have found people changing a baby 's diapers or working on outboard motors on food preparation surfaces , he said when the towns first passed their local ordinances .	brown failed to heed repeated warnings that he needed a state license , so the department had no choice but to follow through and take him to court , whitcomb said .	whitcomb 's office has been swamped with hundreds of emails from maine and beyond the past two days , he said .	most emails have asked that the matter against brown be dropped , with some people applauding the state for stepping in . "	it 's become a popularity contest versus human health , " he said .	maine has hundreds of small family farms that grow fruits and vegetables , raise cattle , sheep and pigs , and process food products such as strawberry jam , cheese and baked goods .	they typically sell their food products at farm stands , from their farmhouses or at farmers ' markets .	besides blue hill , townspeople in penobscot , sedgwick , trenton and hope passed ordinances this year exempting farmers from state and federal regulations as long as they 're selling their products directly to consumers .	officials delivered a summons to brown last week alleging he was in violation of maine agriculture laws by selling milk and other foods at farmers ' markets and his farm stand without the necessary state licenses .	it also said he was illegally selling unpasteurized milk in a container that was n't labeled as such .	he faces a fine of up to $ 500 for each violation .	furthermore , milk , cottage cheese and butter samples taken from brown 's farm stand in july were tested and found to be in violation of state health standards for milk and milk products , the summons reads . "	the milk and cottage cheese samples , in particular , had bacteria counts 10 to 15 times greater than allowable limits , " the court document reads .	supporters of the local ordinances say existing regulations are burdensome and cost-prohibitive , and that family farmers and food processors do n't pose a significant public health risk .	a rally is planned on brown 's behalf friday in blue hill , and supporters have launched a letter-writing campaign urging people to write whitcomb and gov. paul lepage asking that the lawsuit against brown be dropped and that blue hill 's local ordinance be respected .	organizations that work on issues affecting family farms say they 're aware of a small number of towns and counties in california , washington and arizona that have passed resolutions or ordinances aimed at streamlining the regulatory process for small-scale farmers and food producers .	the goal is to make it easier for farmers to sell food to their neighbors , while giving the public more access to locally grown foods , said pete kennedy , president of the farm to consumer legal defense fund . "	but as far as passing ordinances , maine is farther along than other states , " he said .
neighbors of a bosnian-born man accused of making a fake bomb threat at florida 's jacksonville international airport said he lived a quiet life with his wife and children and they were shocked to see him under arrest .	zeljko causevic remained jailed thursday on $ 1 million bail on charges that he falsely told a security screener he had a bomb in his backpack as he tried to enter the airport 's passenger area tuesday night .	that caused a five-hour closure at the airport , the cancellation of dozens of flights and the stranding of passengers overnight .	the 39-year-old truck driver 's backpack only contained an electronic scale , two batteries and a microchip , authorities said .	news of his arrest spread quickly on the quiet jacksonville cul-de-sac where causevic lives .	neighor eldina kadiric said that when she saw his picture on television wednesday , she immediately thought , " wait , i know him . "	the news left her stunned , she said . "	it just seems like they 're normal .	they 're just very normal , " she said . "	they have two kids who i see playing outside all the time . "	she said she does n't know their ages , but one is nearly a teen and the other younger . "	i feel for the family and what they are going through , " kadiric said . "	even if it was a joke , that 's a pretty bad joke to play . "	authorities and a witness say causevic , a naturalized u.s. citizen , tried to bypass the airport 's security checkpoint and then a transportation security agency agent stopped him .	according to a jacksonville sheriff 's office arrest report , causevic told the agent he had a device in his backpack that was " supposed to be a bomb , but it 's not . "	he also told authorities he had a " detonator , " which was a remote control device .	catherine swan-clark , who is seven months pregnant , was waiting to get a pat-down when she saw security agents gather around a man she believed to be causevic . "	so you 're telling me you have a bomb ? "	swan-clark heard a tsa agent ask him . "	and he responded yes , ' i have a bomb . ' "	causevic remained silent during his brief hearing before duval county court judge russell healey on charges of making a false report about planting a bomb and possessing a hoax bomb .	phone numbers listed for causevic were disconnected .	there was no answer at the door of the family 's home .

online retailers can start gathering signatures for a referendum to overturn california 's new law that requires more of them to collect sales tax from customers in the state , officials said monday .	attorney general kamala harris on monday approved ballot language for the measure to overturn the so-called amazon tax .	supporters must collect nearly 505,000 valid signatures to put the measure before voters as soon as june 2012 .	online retailers must collect sales tax if they are " engaged in business " in the state , which usually requires having a physical presence in california .	lawmakers passed a bill in june to expand the definition to include sister companies or marketing affiliates with a presence in the state , saying the change would bring in $ 200 million in taxes that the state is owed but can not collect .	retail giant amazon.com inc. and other online retailers cut ties with thousands of california affiliates and have refused to collect the taxes .	they have argued that forcing them to collect hundreds of different taxes and tax rates across the nation is a burden and that a streamlined national approach is needed . "	now that it 's approved , they 'll begin gathering signatures , " said steve merksamer , a sacramento attorney who represents the campaign committee backing the referendum .	backers of the internet tax include california retailers that lose business because the online players effectively offer a discount by not charging the tax , as well as online retailers who have physical stores in california and are required to collect the tax on internet sales .	one retail group suggested that the referendum will be challenged in court . "	regardless of whether the courts find this referendum to be constitutional , which is certainly in question , there is no doubt that californians will not be bullied or fooled by amazon as it does whatever it takes to get a special tax advantage at the expense of california small businesses , jobs and taxpayers , " the california retail association said in a prepared statement .	the chairman of the state board of equalization said the approval marks the start of a battle between law-abiding businesses and scofflaw companies . "	this is a question of equity and fairness , " said chairman jerome horton . "	will out-of-state companies have to pay their fair share and contribute to the essential services of california , or can they exploit california 's consumer market without contributing to california 's infrastructure ?

dubbed " super pacs " and flush with millions of dollars , outside groups backing and attacking mitt romney and newt gingrich include a hotel magnate , a casino mogul and former partners at romney 's private equity firm .	they 're all over the airwaves in the early voting states , at times spending as much as the republican presidential candidates themselves .	the names of these super political action committees ? "	winning our future " and " restore our future , " for example ?	do n't give any clues to the average voter who 's behind them .	and though big money has always been a part of big elections , this

least weeks longer .	but some are known .	last week , the pro-gingrich winning our future pac received $ 5 million from las vegas billionaire sheldon adelson .	the group is expected to use the cash for new television advertisements in this month 's primary elections ?	$ 3.4 million of it in south carolina ?	as the former house speaker tries to overtake front-runner romney in the race for the gop nomination .	the group said sunday it was planning to run a half-hour film assailing romney 's tenure at the investment firm bain capital .	adelson is one of wealthiest people in america , and his huge contribution coincides with tough comments by gingrich in support of israel , a signature issue of adelson 's .	gingrich in december said that palestinians were an " invented " people , and he has warned about the consequences of iran developing nuclear weapons , an important issue to israel .	the film and expected ad purchases by winning our future are the latest salvos in support of gingrich , who was hammered by the pro-romney group , restore our future , with $ 3 million in attack ads during the iowa caucuses .	that romney-boosting group is planning at least $ 2.3 million in south carolina .	it 's a sign that ad spending among super pacs is ramping up dramatically .	some outside groups , such as gop-leaning american crossroads , are largely holding off spending until the general election .	the latest help for gingrich is a timely boost for the candidate , whose campaign only months ago reported more than $ 1 million in debt .	the aid is largely thanks to adelson , the head of the las vegas sands corp. .	gingrich 's major campaign support by longtime allies is n't unique .	while a casino mogul has come to his aid , so have venture capitalists for their old boss , former massachusetts gov. romney .	restore our future , run by former romney adviser carl forti , raised more than $ 12 million during the first half of 2011 , bolstered in part by former bain executives and romney friends .	edward conard , a bain vice president who sat on the boards of several of the firm 's companies , gave $ 1 million in april ?	a donation that was initially credited to

"	i can hear parents getting the tar and feathers ready , " said ben strawn , a third-grade teacher at summit elementary in bloomington .	strawn told the herald-times that many of the frustrations are tied to glitches with portions of the test that are taken online .	students took paper-and-pencil exams during the first round of testing , but many will take the second portion online .	many schools reported frozen computer screens and other problems during stress tests of the online system .	some districts decided to seek state permission to use pencil and paper for the second part of the test .	fairview elementary parent beth rosales said she un-enrolled her fourth-grader , marybeth , during the last round of istep + testing because she thinks educators have been forced into preparing for tests , and that interrupts learning time .	she re-enrolled her after the test window closed .	by withdrawing her daughter , rosales ensured the school was n't penalized by a zeroed score .	rosales said she is considering un-enrolling again but does n't want her daughter to miss out on things such as musical concerts , which coincide with this spring 's test window .	the changes to this year 's test , which came after indiana withdrew from the national common core standards and created its own measurements , also mean it will be more difficult for parents and teachers to know how well students did .	the daily journal reports administrators were told by the indiana department of education not to expect results until this fall , and to expect their scores to drop from previous years .	clark-pleasant assistant superintendent john schilawski said intense attention paid to the revised test and the distractions those brought mean this year 's data might not reflect students ' true capabilities . "	that 's one of the hardships whenever you do changeover , because you ca n't rely on the trends from the past except in negative connotations , " schilawski said .	greenwood assistant superintendent of learning rick ahlgrim said administrators will focus on individual section scores to see where students have mastered the concepts and lessons , or where they need more help . "	istep 's usefulness to us is still a skill-by-skill analysis of student performance , " ahlgrim said . "	regardless of what the score is on the test as a whole , we 'll still be able to drill down into specifics in skill areas . "	administrators say the istep + data can be applied even after students have moved on to the next grade level . "	we are always , always analyzing data , " said deb brown-nally , executive director of curriculum and instruction for franklin schools . "	istep is just one piece . "

the former mayor of bayou la batre will be sentenced friday on charges that he used federal funding meant to aid the recovery after hurricane katrina to buy land from a family member at an inflated price .	a jury convicted stan wright on march 1 of conspiracy , theft of government funds and witness intimidation .	assistant u.s. attorney maria murphy asked in a court filing for the maximum prison term , arguing that wright abused his office by arranging the use of federal funds to purchase a family owned property needed for a housing project after hurricane katrina .	prosecutors also said that wright deserves punishment for trying to retaliate against a police captain who reported the incident to the fbi .

a state-owned industrial park created 20 years ago in lenoir county has made progress recruiting businesses and well-paying jobs despite failing to meet early expectations , the north carolina legislature 's watchdog agency said tuesday .	now , the agency says , lawmakers must decide whether to keep operating and investing in a venture that 's still operating in the red .	the north carolina global transpark has received $ 94 million in state funds since it began in 1991 but currently only has 14 tenants employing more than 400 workers to show for it , raising the ire of critics who have called it a boondoggle .	several hundred more jobs are expected by 2014 from aircraft parts supplier spirit aerosystems , thanks in part to $ 100 million in incentives from the state 's share of tobacco settlement funds for onsite building upgrades .	the transpark authority , the project 's governing board , has fallen short of a 1994 master plan predicting 3,600 jobs within five years in part because there has n't been enough spent to date on infrastructure to improve access to the park by rail and roads , the general assembly 's program evaluation division said . "	the global transpark today is different from what was originally envisioned , " the report said of the park about 80 miles southeast of raleigh .	a feasibility study conducted when then-gov .	jim martin sought the project to help eastern north carolina projected more than $ 700 million in investments would be needed to create the air cargo jetport .	instead , the transpark has received nearly $ 250 million from state , local , federal and private sources since it began , the report said .	the average salary of the current tenant worker is $ 53,750 , or 80 percent higher than the average wage in lenoir county , the report said .	still , report principal author sean hamel said the transpark could do a better job managing its efforts to recruit targeted industries to eastern north carolina to create jobs .	although the n.c. department of commerce and the regional economic development board market the global transpark , less than 10 percent of the transpark authority 's staff is focused on economic development .	the report also said the industrial park does n't have an internal management system that monitors whether progress is being made on meeting goals .	the transpark still is n't self-sustaining , the report said , pointing out that its operating expenses still exceed operating revenues . "	current operations do not allow the authority to be self-sufficient , " hamel said .	the cumulative benefits of the transpark project in the form of taxes generated from jobs at the site wo n't meet the cumulative costs of the project until 2025 , the report said .	the general assembly has to choose whether it should remain committed with a $ 4 million annual investment for the transpark or get the state out of the project , according to the report .	the state could n't leave the project immediately ?	a job and work force training center at the transpark paid for with the federal funds must remain open to the public until 2017 , and spirit aerosystems has a priority use at the site until 2020 . "	immediate divestiture from the global transpark is not possible because of land and property restrictions , " hamel said .	in the meantime , lawmakers should establish a repayment schedule for the $ 40 million owed to the state 's escheats fund .	the project initially received $ 25 million but the debt has grown with interest as lawmakers have extended the loan repayment five times since 1999 .	the full balance is due again in october , hamel said .	global transpark executive director darlene waddell said the legislature should continue to commit to the project .	commerce secretary keith crisco said the spirit aerosystems project , announced in 2008 , has generated more interest from firms wanting to expand , he said . "	let the global transpark and the state finish what it started to do , " waddell said . "	it 's a long time for economic development and it takes a lot of patience .	we 're well on our way to becoming the economic engine for eastern north carolina . "	members of an oversight committee that heard the division 's report had several questions .	the committee will make recommendations based on the report to the full legislature , including whether north carolina has received a real return on its investment there .	sen. rick gunn , r-alamance and a real estate developer , suggested that the perceived shortcomings of the transpark in some parts of the state are still an obstacle to be overcome . "	this is a place that you never would send anybody because it 's got this stigma attached to it , " gunn said .

a federal judge said wednesday that he was reluctant to remove a court-appointed trustee pushing for the reorganization of a bankrupt montana power cooperative .	members of southern montana electric generation and transmission are seeking to oust trustee lee freeman and liquidate the troubled co-op .	that would let thousands of customers largely off the hook for an $ 85 million loan used to build the little-used highwood power plant near great falls ?	a scenario that freeman says ignores southern montana 's obligation to its lenders .	u.s. bankruptcy judge ralph kirscher did not issue a final ruling on the trustee 's fate during a four-hour hearing wednesday .	but he said he was inclined to let creditors decide on which course the co-op should take , rather than ousting freeman now .	kirscher said that after two years of bankruptcy proceedings , the case is finally on the verge of a vote that could settle southern montana 's future . "	why would i pull the plug on the trustee at this point ? "	the judge asked robert baldwin , an attorney for the members seeking to oust freeman . "	i really am reluctant to remove the trustee at this time , when we have competing plans .	why do n't we get it done ?	why do n't we vote on it ? "	southern montana 's members serve an estimated 11,000 consumers in central and southern montana .	the reorganization plan offered by freeman calls for electricity rates for those consumers to steadily increase over the next 12 years , in part to generate money to pay back highwood 's lenders .	freeman 's attorney , john parks , said lenders including prudential insurance and modern woodman agreed to accept repayment of only $ 60 million under the trustee 's proposal .	a competing plan was offered last month by southern montana 's four members ?	fergus electric , beartooth electric , mid-yellowstone valley electric and tongue river electric .	their liquidation proposal would provide prudential insurance and other lenders only as much money as the members could get for selling assets such as highwood .	the members have valued the plant at just over $ 16 million .	if the trustee were removed , the members ' plan would be the only one on the table , although kirscher said the lenders could step in and offer their own plan .	the financial problems that led to southern montana 's 2011 bankruptcy were rooted in a failed attempt to build a 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant and sell much of the electricity it generated on the market .	the project was later scaled back to a 40-megawatt gas plant that has sat dormant most of the time since its completion .	adding to southern montana 's woes was a 2009 contract with ppl montana that obligated the co-op to buy more power than it needed .	the excess power was dumped on the market at low rates , freeman testified , undermining the co-ops already tenuous financial situation .	ppl 's contract was later cancelled by freeman , and the company has a pending claim against southern montana for more than $ 370 million .

greece 's international creditors are criticizing the country 's handling of reforms promised in return for a euro110 billion ( $ 161 billion ) bailout and warn that the next loan installment can not be paid out until financing gaps have been closed .	the summary of a report from the european union , the european central bank and the international monetary fund says the implementation of the bailout program " has come to a halt in past quarters . "	the summary , obtained by the associated press thursday , also details further austerity measures promised by greece , including steep cuts to public services .	it says greece 's economy will likely shrink 3.8 percent this year , more than the 3.5 percent predicted in may , and that without further measures this year 's budget deficit would remain above 10 percent of economic output .	this is a breaking news update .	check back soon for further information .	ap 's earlier story is below .	athens , greece ( ap ) ?	workers at greek state-run companies walked off the job thursday to protest the government 's privatization plan , part of the country 's renewed push to meet the terms of its international bailout .	about two thousand strikers marched through central athens , hours before prime minister george papandreou was to convene his cabinet to approve more austerity measures through 2015 .	the ministers will then send the plans to parliament .	papandreou and his ministers have come under intense criticism from their own socialist party deputies in a series of marathon meetings over the plans , which include a remedial euro6 .4 billion ( $ 9.4 billion ) package of cuts and tax hikes for this year , a renewed austerity drive for 2012-2015 and a euro50 billion ( $ 73 billion ) privatization program .	under the slogan " we wo n't sell , " workers at state companies were holding strikes throughout the day .	public transport workers were walking off the job in the early morning and late evening , while port workers , post offices and banks called a 24-hour strike .	television station technicians were also on strike , as were journalists at the state-run broadcaster , disrupting live news programing .	a general strike has been called for june 15 .	the prospect of new measures has led to outrage .	angry greeks have taken over the central syntagma square , setting up a tent city in a sit-in , while tens of thousands of people thronged the square , which lies in front of parliament , last sunday .	while deputies from papandreou 's governing pasok party have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of ministers , none have said outright they will not vote for the plan in parliament , where pasok holds a six-seat majority in the 300-member legislature .	since may 2010 , greece has been relying on funds from a euro110 billion package of rescue loans from the international monetary fund and other eurozone countries to prevent it from defaulting on its massive debts .	in return , it has taken a series of austerity measures , including cutting civil service salaries , trimming pensions and increasing taxes across the board .	but they have not been enough , and it is now clear that consistently high interest rates will almost certainly prevent the country from borrowing on the international bond market next year , as the bailout plan had initially envisaged .	this means greece risks defaulting on its debts next year unless it receives additional help beyond the current bailout .	it also raises problems for the continued disbursement of the current bailout loans , which greece has been receiving in installments .	athens expects to get the next tranche , worth euro12 billion , next month , but imf regulations stipulate that the institution can not release the money until the funding gap greece faces next year is corrected .	eu officials have been working on trying to find a solution , such as a new package of rescue loans .	the country has been consistently slipping on many of its targets under the initial bailout , and the government now finds itself forced to push through the new spending cuts and tax hikes .	the latest economic indicators released thursday continued to disappoint .	gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2011 was down a steep 5.5 percent on the year ?	although it did see a small increase of 0.2 percent compared with the last quarter of 2010 , the national statistical agency said .	it said inflation eased to an annual rate of 3.3 percent in may from 3.9 percent in april .	the growth figures , combined with the uncertainty over greek funding , helped push the country 's borrowing costs back up , with yields on 10-year bonds at 16.4 percent , compared with germany 's benchmark rate of 3.1 percent .	while all the details of the austerity plans have not been officially released , leaks have indicated they will include tax increases on fuel , property , soft drinks and tobacco , as well as on restaurants and bars .	the threshold below which income is not taxed will be reduced significantly , while more taxes could also be imposed on pensioners .	derek gatopoulos in athens contributed .

crook county officials in northeast wyoming are assessing damage from flooding that washed out roads and damaged bridges this week as weather forecasters warned of more rain and snow ahead for the state .	the belle fourche river surged six feet over flood stage this week in crook county but was falling on wednesday , crook county emergency management spokeswoman katie allen said .	the river was at highest it 's been since 1954 when it peaked earlier this week , allen said .

"	they did n't go about this right , " lueders said .	transitory records are deemed to be of such temporary usefulness that they do n't need to be retained for any specific period , according to the filing .	one day after the aug. 24 board meeting , the rule changes were cited in the denial of an open records request from the madison state journal .	the newspaper was seeking any texts pertaining to a $ 500,000 loan that a state agency , the wisconsin economic development corp. , gave to building committee inc. , a struggling construction company run by a walker donor .	the rule changes also were raised in response to a request from one wisconsin now , a liberal group seeking a list of visitor 's to the governor 's residence .	the department of administration released a partial list and said other records had been deemed transitory and had n't been retained .	the complaint was filed through the dane county district attorney 's office .	prosecutor ismael r. ozanne , however , did n't immediately respond to messages seeking comment .	walker administration spokeswoman laurel patrick said monday that the governor 's office willingly complies with open records law and noted that the public records board receives no direction from walker 's office .	neither georgia thompson , who heads the public records board , nor the department of administration immediately responded to a phone messages seeking comment .	a phone number listed for building committee inc. had been disconnected .	lueders said that given the scope of their impact , the changes should n't have been made by the public records board .	instead , he said , they should have been handled by the legislature or through a formal rule change , both of which would involve public comment and debate . "	they need to go back to square one , " he said , " and begin again . "

america 's oldest street railway , the st. charles line of green new orleans streetcars , has been added to the national historic landmark list .	it will be the second moving site in the country to make the list .	the other is the san francisco cable cars , which date back to 1873 and made the landmark list in 1964 .	camille strachan , president of the saint charles avenue association , says the designation is a high honor . "	it connects neighborhoods and is an important component in our city 's history , " strachan said .	the new orleans streetcar line opened in 1835 under mule power as the carrollton line .	it carried passengers some 13 miles from downtown new orleans , up st. charles avenue to what was then the separate municipality of carrollton .	the line was converted to electricity in 1893 and renamed the st. charles line .	today , the line is operated by the regional transit authority , which also manages the newer canal street line of red streetcars and city buses .	they have a combined annual ridership of more than 18 million people .	saint charles association member laura claverie said the group worked for 10 years to get the historic landmark designation .	she said the streetcars and san francisco cable cars are both icons and symbolize their cities .	national historic landmark recognition is reserved only for those few things in the united states that represent the culture , history , and development of the nation , she said .	there are fewer than 2,500 in the u.s. and only 53 in louisiana , she said .	the transit authority is holding a celebration on howard avenue at lee circle on tuesday to commemorate the occasion .	plans call for a decorated streetcar to carry dignitaries to the site , where the national historic landmark designation will be officially announced .	the other eight national sites added to the list this year include brown bridge in rutland county , vermont .	it was constructed in 1880 and is one of the longest-surviving examples of a town lattice truss .	it also includes the duck creek aqueduct in metamora , indiana , which was built around 1846 .	it represents a rare surviving component of an american canal system that was a significant mode of transportation in the first half of the 19th century .	u.s. secretary of the interior sally jewell and national park service director jonathan b. jarvis recently announced the designations .	jarvis said , " from artists and architecture , to the accomplishments of explorers and entrepreneurs , these sites highlight the mosaic of our nation 's historic past .

the look combined suspicion and warning , and visitors found they no longer had the urge to give the old girl a pat on the head .	since 2001 , the hansen family has been raising bison on their farm about two miles south of orfordville .	it 's something ben hansen 's parents , marilyn and jim hansen , started after selling their dairy herd .	all their lives they had collected antiques , and they were especially interested in native american culture and history .	after much debate -- they also considered getting long horn cows -- they bought seven buffalo . "	my dad was really intrigued by them , " hansen told the janesville gazette ( http://bit.ly/1l9wdre ) .	the animals ' role in the history of the native americans and the growth of the american west was endlessly interesting to the elder hansen . "	he was just always intrigued whenever a documentary would come on , " hansen said . "	they were saying that the buffalo population was getting down to extinct , and he thought , ' you know , why not ? ' "	when his father bought the first animals , they were just for his own pleasure . "	he 'd come down here and stand by the fence for part of the day just watching them , " hansen said .	when his father died in 2009 , his mother suggested that ben come home and manage the farm .	he had been laid off from his job in town and decided to make the move .	his wife , renee , and his daughter kelsey work on the farm , and his mother is part owner , as well .	the family also runs a custom harvesting operation and runs about 350 acres of corn and hay .	the meat is sold to three restaurants , and customers also buy it at the farm .	about eight families buy a half a steer from him every year .	the meat is lean and low in cholesterol .	it tastes different than beef but does n't have " the wild , gamy taste like venison , " he said .	the animals are grass fed , and that appeals to many customers .	raising buffalo is n't anything like raising dairy or beef cattle .	the animals on hansen 's farm might be less wild than their great plains ancestors , but to call them domesticated would be a mistake .	these are dangerous animals .	along with their horns , the tops of their spines contain a series of vertical bones that strengthen their necks and shoulders .	it 's a body that 's designed to plow through 4 feet of snow on the western plains .	the bulls fight each other during mating season , and the females will engage in battles to determine status .	even the hansens , who know the animals , do n't interact with them in the pastures .	the most challenging part of raising bison is loading them into trucks for processing .	the joints of their back legs have a wide range of motion , allowing them to maneuver in tight spaces such as the chutes leading into the trailers .	they can run between 35 and 40 mph and are great jumpers . "	we had a bull that jumped over a 6-foot metal cattle fence , " hansen said .	they stampede , too .	the first night they brought buffalo to the farm , the first animal out of the trailer took off at a run and the rest followed .	they charged across the field in the dark , straight into the fence .	the fence held , but only just .	the cow that led the charge ended up with a twisted horn .	she 's still alive and well , and looked willing to take another run at the fence -- or anybody who messed with her .	despite the challenges , the hansens like the animals , and plan on expanding their herd to about 100 .	according to the wisconsin bison producers association , the state is home to about 70 herds .	in the rock and walworth county area , there are bison farms in sharon , elkhorn and janesville .

retail sales in the 17 countries that use the euro unexpectedly rose 0.2 percent during july despite darkening forecasts about european growth , according to official data released monday .	compared with july last year , retail trade was down only 0.2 percent , the eu statistics agency eurostat said .	both the monthly and annual figures were better than many analysts had expected .	some had foreseen a drop of as much as 1.0 percent from the year earlier .	the uptick in july comes despite downbeat headlines about eurozone leaders ' struggles to contain a crisis over too much debt in several eurozone countries .	the volume of bad news has not only shaken financial markets but is also beginning to frighten businesses and consumers and weigh on production and consumption .	weakening growth indicators have led many observers to rule out further interest rate increases by the european central bank , which holds its monthly policy meeting this week , with an announcement on thursday .	the july figures follow an increase of 0.7 percent in june from the previous month , revised down from 0.9 percent , and an annual drop of 0.7 percent , revised from a decrease of 0.4 percent .

the army psychiatrist charged in the deadly fort hood shooting rampage apparently will be allowed to keep his beard during his military trial , after a new judge indicated tuesday that she wo n't force him to shave .	the previous judge 's order requiring maj. nidal hasan to be clean-shaven or be forcibly shaved before his trial had tied up the case for more than three months , but an appeals court ousted that judge earlier this month .	hasan , 42 , an american-born muslim , faces the death penalty or life in military prison without parole if convicted in the 2009 rampage that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others on the texas army post .	the new judge overseeing hasan 's case told him during a hearing tuesday that the beard , now thicker than when he first appeared in court with it in june , violates army regulations .	the judge , col. tara osborn , said she wo n't hold it against him but that military jurors might .	hasan answered " yes , ma'am " when osborn asked if he grew the beard voluntarily .	in a previous court hearing , he said he grew the beard because his muslim faith requires it and not as a show of disrespect .	osborn asked defense attorneys to draft jury instructions about the issue .	jurors likely will be told not to consider hasan 's appearance when deciding on a verdict .	osborn was appointed to the case two weeks ago , after the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces removed the former judge and tossed his order regarding hasan 's beard .	the ruling said col. gregory gross did not appear impartial while presiding over hasan 's case and that the command ?	not a judge ?	is responsible for enforcing military grooming standards .	hasan 's trial date has n't been set .	osborn first has to rule on several pending motions .	defense attorneys also want osborn to reverse gross ' rulings on nearly two dozen motions , including requests for change-of-venue , a couple of experts and some investigative reports .	defense attorneys also said they will again ask that hasan be allowed to plead guilty .	at an august hearing , gross said he was not able to accept a guilty plea on the 13 charges of premeditated murder because army rules prohibit a judge from accepting a guilty plea in a death penalty case .	hasan also is charged with 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder .

a rhode island lawyer convicted of facilitating bribes for three former north providence town councilmen wants a federal judge to disregard a " draconian guideline calculation " recommending he go to prison for eight to 10 years and sentence him at most to home confinement for his role in the scheme .	in a sentencing memorandum filed on monday , robert s. ciresi 's attorney said he should not be sent to prison because of his advanced age , 52 years of law experience , public service record and " overall good character . " "	the defendant 's age , long history of faithful adherence to the law profession , his stints at public service and his overall good character suggest that the draconian guideline calculation is unreasonable , " wrote defense attorney john f. cicilline . "	if any jail sentence is deemed necessary by the court , it should be in the form of home confinement . "	cicilline also noted ciresi 's role in the scheme was " minor , " and points out that at age 78 he has outlived the male life expectancy rate by 2 ?	years .	ciresi suffers from high blood pressure , gout and acid reflex , cicilline wrote .	in the first bribe , a supermarket developer paid $ 25,000 to the then-councilmen ?	john zambarano , joseph burchfield and raymond douglas iii ?	in exchange for votes to approve a zoning change needed for the project to go forward .	ciresi , who represented the developer , delivered the bribe to zambarano in february 2009 at a brief nighttime meeting in the parking lot of an italian restaurant in cranston , which was observed by the fbi , prosecutors said .	ciresi was also accused of putting zambarano and the others in touch with the middleman in the second bribe in early 2010 .	through that middleman , prosecutors say , the councilmen demanded a $ 75,000 bribe from another developer who needed a zoning change to convert a defunct mill into housing .	the developer had only paid $ 21,000 by the time the councilmen were arrested .	the developers have not been charged .	a jury convicted ciresi in april of conspiracy , bribery and extortion .	he faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge .	bribery and extortion carry sentences of up to 10 years and 20 years in prison , respectively .	federal sentencing guidelines recommend ciresi serve at least eight years , cicilline said .	chief judge mary m. lisi will sentence him on aug. 3 in u.s. district court in providence .	zambarano was sentenced in may to just less than six years .	burchfield was ordered to prison for five years and four months , while douglas received 6 ?	years .	ciresi said he plans to appeal his conviction .	cicilline has said the evidence does not support the jury 's verdict .	the appeal will be filed once ciresi is sentenced , cicilline said .	he is also asking to be granted bail while his appeal is pending .	federal prosecutors oppose that request .	ciresi is currently free on unsecured bond , cicilline said .	he added no action has been taken against his law license yet .	in court filings , cicilline wrote ciresi 's conviction means he will not be allowed to practice law anymore .

fortune-telling for a fee is protected by free speech , maryland 's highest court ruled on thursday .	the maryland court of appeals reversed a montgomery county court decision that supported an ordinance banning fortune-telling for money .	judge clayton greene jr. , who wrote the court 's opinion , concluded that while fortune-tellers may sometimes deceive their customers , it 's not up to the court to pass judgment on the validity or value of their soothsaying . "	if montgomery county is concerned that fortune-tellers will engage in fraudulent conduct , the county can enforce fraud laws in the event that fraud occurs , " greene wrote in the majority opinion .	judge glenn harrell jr. , who wrote a dissenting opinion , concluded that the ordinance is limited in its application to fortune-telling for remuneration , instead of all of it , and that the ordinance restricts no more speech than is necessary to prevent fraud .	the lawsuit was brought in 2008 by nick nefredo , who had been denied a license to open a fortune-telling business in montgomery county .	the american civil liberties union praised the majority opinion . "	while individual fortune-tellers can be punished if they fraudulently exploit their customers , banning all fortune-telling is overbroad and unconstitutional , " said ajmel quereshi , an attorney with the aclu of maryland .
a father who was intentionally misled about the birth of his child should have been able to stop the baby 's adoption , the nebraska supreme court said friday , reversing the ruling of a lower court .	the father , listed only as jeremiah j. in court documents , appealed after a hall county court ruled last year that he could not stop adoption proceedings for his biological daughter .	the lower court said jeremiah had failed to object to the adoption within five business days after the birth , as required by state law .	but nebraska 's high court reversed that ruling , noting that the girl 's mother , identified only as dakota d. , testified she had purposely misled jeremiah regarding the child 's date of birth to prevent him from complying with the state 's law .	one nebraska supreme court judge even suggested that nebraska 's five-day filing deadline is too short .	court documents say jeremiah learned in june 2011 that dakota , his ex-girlfriend , was pregnant .	five months later , jeremiah was contacted by an adoption agency caseworker , who told him that he had been identified as the baby 's father and that dakota planned to put the baby , due feb. 18 , 2012 , up for adoption .	jeremiah told the caseworker he did not want that , then tried many times to reach dakota by phone , but she refused to return his calls , records said .	the child was born feb. 9 , but jeremiah was not told about the birth .	jeremiah finally contacted dakota on feb. 13 , but she did not tell him the baby had been born .	jeremiah also repeatedly called the hospital and caseworker to try to learn of the birth , but they refused to tell him , citing privacy policies .	dakota later testified in court that she did not tell jeremiah of the child 's birth because she did not want him to know about it during the five days he had to object to the adoption .	a hall county court issued summary judgment in the mother 's favor , and said jeremiah could have hired an attorney sooner .	in reversing the lower court 's ruling , nebraska 's high court noted the mother 's deception . "	a biological mother may not deliberately misrepresent or withhold information as to the date of the child 's birth in order to prevent the biological father from timely objecting to the adoption of the child , " judge john wright wrote . "	the 5-day notice set forth in ( state law ) is not meant to be used as a subterfuge for deception to prevent an alleged father from objecting to the adoption of the child in question . "	nebraska supreme court judge william connolly took issue with nebraska 's adoption laws . "	in nebraska , if a biological mother withholds or misrepresents information about the child 's birth to a ... father , the adoption statutes are inadequate to ensure he has an opportunity to claim paternity , " connolly wrote .	connolly said nothing in state law requires the mother , her representatives or state officials to notify a biological father of his child 's birth .	he also indicated that nebraska 's five-day filing deadline after the birth of the baby is too short , noting that most states have a 30-day deadline . "	nebraska 's 5-day filing deadline after the child 's birth appears to be the shortest of any state statutory scheme , " connolly wrote . "	and unlike some state statutes , nebraska 's statutes do not contain an exception for ... fathers who did not receive notice of the child 's birth . "	neither attorneys for jeremiah nor dakota immediately returned messages left friday by the associated press seeking comment on the high court 's opinion .
u.s. senators from states along and near the nation 's northern border requested thursday that the department of defense provide military radar to crack down on what they said is a growing problem of using low-flying aircraft in drug trafficking .	drug smuggling across the border with canada is much more prevalent than indicated by the number of cases in which drugs have been seized , according to a federal report from november .	less than 1 percent of the 4,000-mile border is considered under the operational control of u.s. border officials , a general accountability office report found this month .	most areas of the northern border are remote and inaccessible by traditional patrol methods , the report said .	pennsylvania 's u.s. sen. bob casey , who requested the study , said that 's " not acceptable .

" "	we hear about the path of illegal drugs from chicago and the spread of meth from our western borders , " kohl said , " but securing our northern border is too often overlooked . "	customs and border protection said it believes it can detect illegal entries and respond to and deal with them on only about 32 miles ( 50 kilometers ) of the northern border .	the border patrol was aware of all illegal border crossings on only 25 percent of the border , or 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometers ) , the gao report said .	the effort by the democratic senators comes after the department of homeland security said it added border patrol agents , new technology and more .	more than 2,200 agents are assigned to the northern border , a 700 percent increase since the 2001 terrorist attacks .	the tools include thermal camera systems and mobile surveillance systems .	recent u.s.-canada agreements allow law enforcement to share information and cross-training involving the royal canadian mounted police , the u.s. coast guard , customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement .	homeland security spokesman adam fetcher said the agency will review the letter and respond directly to the senators .

"	some members of canada 's parliament have dismissed american worries about security along the countries ' border .	immigration minister jason kenney has said canada has improved security .	use of radar in washington state from 2005 to 2008 by the departments of defense and homeland security was considered a success in identifying low-flying , drug-smuggling aircraft that had n't been previously identified , said sens. charles schumer , of new york , and jon tester , of montana . "	given what is at stake in combating illegal cross-border activity , and given its past success , i write to ask your agencies to coordinate in determining whether there are any available military technological assets anywhere around the world that can be more effectively deployed along our northern border to combat drug smuggling , " the senators wrote in the letter .
protesters from the occupy harrisburg group are delaying the start of a hearing on a plan to redraw the boundaries of pennsylvania 's legislative districts .	the protesters began call-and-response chants in the hearing room where the legislative reapportionment commission meeting is to meet friday .	dozens were expected to testify at the hearing in an office building adjacent to the state capitol .	the republican-backed plan would reshape the state 's 203 house districts and 50 senate districts .	the proposal would move one senate seat from southwestern pennsylvania to monroe county in the pocono mountains .	in the house , it would add districts in lehigh , berks , chester and york counties while eliminating districts in allegheny , philadelphia and erie counties .	occupy harrisburg protesters have been staging demonstrations outside the capitol for more than a month .
the nature conservancy says it has protected nearly 150 acres of prairie and wetlands it will add to its 650-acre ordway prairie preserve in pope county in west-central minnesota .	funding came from the outdoor heritage fund , which was created under the clean water , land and legacy amendment .	peggy ladner , director of the nature conservancy in minnesota , says the ordway prairie is an outstanding example of the grasslands that once dominated the landscape in western and southern minnesota .	it 's home to prairie grasses and wildflowers , wetlands and wildlife .	the addition is a mixture of unplowed native prairie and wetlands but will need restoration work to return the property to a more natural condition .	the property is open to the public for outdoor recreation including hunting , birding , hiking and cross-country skiing .
the national park service will begin taking applications this month for as many as 240 volunteers to shoot elk from an overpopulated herd at theodore roosevelt national park in western north dakota , park officials said wednesday .	applicants will be selected at random by a computer and must pass a background check and a marksmanship test , said bill whitworth , theodore roosevelt 's chief of resource management .	the plan calls for as many as 275 elk to be killed this season . "	we 're working on the final touches on the automated application process , " whitworth said . "	we 're looking at taking applications on or about july 15 . "	the ideal elk population at the 70,000-acre park is fewer than 400 animals , but the herd has grown to more than 1,000 , whitworth said .	forty-seven elk were reintroduced in the park in 1985 , but a moratorium approved in 2003 prohibits the park from transferring elk elsewhere due to chronic wasting disease in other states .	the plan to use volunteers rather than government-funded sharpshooters comes after a lengthy dispute between state officials and the national park service about how to deal with the bloated elk herd .	volunteer shooters will be required to share the meat with food pantries .	whitworth said the culling could begin on nov. 1 , and would likely run through mid-january .	lead bullets wo n't be allowed .	the park service plans to hire about five part-time park staff to oversee the volunteer shooters .	the agency also is seeking interest from packers who would be paid to haul the meat from the kill site to a cold storage facility , whitworth said .	the elk-reduction effort could require as many as 20 volunteers per week , and culling would be allowed tuesdays through thursdays .	volunteers , including those from out of state , will be able to apply for more than one week , he said . "	we would need as many as 20 per week , " whitworth said .	about 275 of the park 's elk would need to be killed each year for five years to reach an ideal population level .	hunters bagged about 170 elk outside park boundaries last season .	animals killed outside the park might be factored as part of the park 's reduction , whitworth said .	the culling effort is expected to cost about $ 250,000 annually , mostly in administrative and park personnel costs , he said .

missouri voters have spoken loudly .	they do n't like the new federal health care law .	and they want to see roy blunt and robin carnahan face off for the u.s. senate .	carnahan , blunt and the health care referendum each carried more than 70 percent of the vote in tuesday 's elections .	blunt , a congressman from southwest missouri , turned back tea party contender chuck purgason to win a nine-way republican senate primary .	carnahan , missouri 's secretary of state , cruised to a senate primary victory over two-lesser known democrats .	missouri voters also approved a state law saying government can not require people to have health insurance or penalize those who do not .	it will conflict with a federal law requiring most americans to have health insurance or face penalties starting in 2014 .

one of the first prongs of president barack obama 's health care law has been in effect now for a year , and the result in missouri is that about 500 additional people with chronic health problems now have insurance .	it is , by most accounts , an underwhelming result .	missouri 's experience is pretty typical of the national norm , which is causing even some supporters of the federal health care law to question how it is being implemented .	one of the less-publicized provisions of the 2010 law required a pre-existing condition insurance plan in each state .	backed by $ 5 billion of federal subsidies , the health plans are intended to provide insurance at lower prices than typically available to people with health problems who have been uninsured for at least six months .	the new health insurance plans provide a bridge to 2014 , when a new requirement kicks in prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums to people based on their health status .	that 's the same year that most people will be required to have health insurance or face tax penalties , and that people will be able to purchase coverage through new online health insurance markets called exchanges .	when missouri began taking applications in july 2010 for its federally mandated pre-existing condition insurance plan , officials expected to cover about 3,000 people , said vernita mcmurtrey , executive director of the missouri health insurance pool .	one year later , it has just one-sixth of that amount ?	about 500 enrollees .	missouri is not unique . "	enrollment is fairly low across all states , " said jennifer tolbert , director of state health policy at the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation .	relying on estimates from the congressional budget office and a unit of the centers for medicare and medicaid services , the u.s. department of health and human services said last july that it believed between 200,000 and 400,000 people likely would enroll in the new health plans .	the actual number is but a fraction of that .	through may 31 , a total of 24,712 people nationwide were enrolled in the pre-existing condition insurance plans .	health care analysts and insurance executives cite several reasons for the lackluster response .	chiefly , the health insurance premiums still are more expensive than many people can afford ?	or want ?	to pay .	federal law prohibits the plans from charging more than the state 's standard individual health insurance premium for people of a similar age .	that means chronically ill people can get insurance policies at the same cost as healthy people .	but many chronically ill people who have gone without insurance for six months either are unemployed or in low-wage jobs , which makes it difficult for them to afford even the standard premiums .	under missouri 's plan , for example , a 50-year-old man who opts for a $ 1,000 deductible would pay a monthly premium of $ 544 , mcmurtrey said .	that would consume about half the paycheck of someone working 40 hours a week in a minimum wage job , without accounting for taxes , housing payments , food , utilities and gas for a car .	missouri lowered its premiums by 25 percent , effective feb. 1 , in an attempt to make the plan more affordable .	program administrators currently are analyzing whether they can lower rates again , mcmurtrey said .	until now , " missouri has n't been really creative in how to get the lowest prices , " said thomas mcauliffe , a policy analyst at the missouri foundation for health .	not helping matters was the fact that many people ?	at least initially ?	found missouri 's application for the program confusing , mcauliffe said .	another factor holding down enrollment is the requirement to first go without insurance for a half year , tolbert said . "	there are probably a lot of people ?	at least some people ?	who have existing insurance , but it 's fairly limited , who would likely benefit by enrolling in the better coverage , " she said .	but " they 're simply not going to be willing to go bare , as we say , for six months to access the better coverage . "	still another factor is the tendency of some people to avoid purchasing insurance until they know it 's needed , said larry case , executive vice president of the missouri association of insurance agents .	even though vehicle liability insurance is required by state law , about 14 percent of missouri drivers lack it , case said .	some people purchase car insurance only because it 's necessary to license their vehicle , then quit making payments , he said .	similarly , case said , people have little incentive to purchase health insurance under the pre-existing condition plan until they know they are headed to the hospital or have a major medical expense upcoming .	mcmurtrey said many people who enroll in the plan immediately use their health coverage , in some cases have major operations such as heart bypass surgeries or organ transplants within two or three weeks .	although some health care analysts said missouri 's program has not been sufficiently publicized , mcmurtrey said she has traveled the state to discuss it at hospitals , nursing homes , community centers , schools and with any group that can spread the information among those with chronic health problems . "	even though the 500 itself is not a high number , we are serving needy missourians , " she said . "	quite honestly , across the country , none of the states have the enrollment we thought we would . "
california health officials say the birth rate for teen mothers hit an all-time low in 2008 .	figures released by the department of public health on monday found that about 35 babies were born for every 1,000 females aged 15 to 19 in 2008 .	that was down by about two births per 1,000 from the previous year .	there were 51,704 babies born to california teens in 2008 .	hispanic teens had the highest birth rate but it still declined .	asian teens had the lowest .	california 's teen birth rate has been declining for the past decade .	in 1991 , the rate was nearly 71 per 1,000 .	the falling state birth rate compares with a rising national rate , which is now higher than 42 births per 1,000 .

"	in the meantime , please know all of us are thinking about those in louisiana who are without their homes or without their businesses .

"	i 've never seen water come up this quick this fast , " he said .	nungesser said there were reports that cattle in the largely rural parish took refuge on porches .	in one instance , cattle broke through a window and lumbered onto furniture to stay above water .	controlled breaches of one overtopped levee and additional pumps are being used to get rid of the water .	business owners and residents who evacuated from the west river bank of flooded south plaquemines parish will be allowed to return temporarily with police escorts on monday .	suburban communities farther north also had problems .	near lake pontchartrain , st. tammany parish officials kept watch over potential trouble spots along isaac-swollen waterways .	an evacuation near the community of bush was dialed back sunday after authorities stabilized a lock in danger of failing on the pearl river diversion canal .	but st. tammany authorities also were keeping an eye on the west pearl river .	parish spokeswoman said about 5,000 homes near that waterway could be affected if it floods .	but st. james the baptist parish officials ordered a curfew until 6 a.m. monday as the blind river stayed at a 5.6-foot ( 1.70-meter ) crest for 24 hours , and about 20 houses flooded .	a state news release said 10 buses had been sent to the parish in case evacuation was necessary , and that about 150 national guard soldiers had also been directed there .	in mississippi , gov. phil bryant reported 125,000 people were evacuated , though most returned home sunday .	less than 100 people remained in shelters .	bryant said 924 people had to be rescued during isaac .	entergy , which provides power to most of the people who lost it , was under fire over the weekend from local government officials for what they said was a slow pace of restoration .	jefferson parish president john young said widespread outages were hampering businesses ' recovery from the storm and he would ask the state public service commission to investigate .	entergy spokesman chanel lagarde noted that isaac had lingered over the state after tuesday 's landfall and said friday was the first day the corporation could get restoration efforts into high gear . "	we are working hard .	we do have a good plan and we 're going about it in an approach that we think is going to be effective , " lagarde said .	in mississippi , about 1,600 entergy customers awaited power .	roughly 5,000 served by not-for-profit electric associations also had no service .	napolitano met with mississippi emergency officials and bryant at a fire station in bay st. louis , mississippi , and was scheduled to make a stop in louisiana later in the day .	bay st. louis was devastated by katrina seven years ago , but this time it was protected from isaac 's surge by a new seawall .
oklahoma voters would decide whether to ban legislators from working for the state for two years after leaving office under a bill passed by a house committee .	the house rules committee on wednesday passed a joint resolution to place the issue on the 2014 general election ballot .	the bill still must clear the house calendar committee before being considered by the full house .	the oklahoma constitution already bans ex-legislators from being employed by the state for up to two years after leaving office , but a 2005 attorney general 's opinion says such employment is allowed if the salary is paid from funds other than state appropriations .	the resolution by edmond republican rep. marian cooksey would prohibit such employment , regardless of the revenue source for the salary .

the number of connecticut homicides committed each year by intimate partners has remained consistent , averaging 15 people killed annually over the past decade , according to a report released wednesday .	between 2000 and 2011 , there were 175 such homicides across the state , with 153 of the victims females and 22 males .	the findings from the connecticut domestic violence fatality review committee show 14 women were killed by a current or former boyfriend or husband in 2011 .	of those deaths , children were believed to have been in the home during three of the homicides .	according to the connecticut coalition against domestic violence , which released the report , there were 18 homicides in 2010 and 11 in 2012 , a figure that was not included in the report .	it 's concerning that the average number of deaths has remained relatively stable , as well as the number of victims seeking help , said karen jarmoc , the coalition 's executive director . "	we are seeing very consistent numbers in our shelters , " jarmoc said . "	our shelters in connecticut are at capacity 95 to 98 percent of the time , which is , as you can imagine , a real challenge . "	jarmoc said there has also been a consistent demand for community and court services , including requests for restraining orders .	wednesday 's report included 15 recommendations , including raising public awareness about the availability of services and supports for domestic violence victims .	the state has not yet found the money to pay for an advertising campaign required by legislation passed three years ago , said state rep. mae flexer , d-danielson , chairman of the house speaker 's task force on domestic violence .	now is the time for the campaign , she added . "	this report clearly demonstrates that knowing where to go for help saves lives , " flexer said . "	the women who were tragically killed , whose fatalities were reviewed in this report , often did not know where to go for help we need to change that and raising public awareness can help create that change . "	the report also recommends that health professionals use a screening tool to identity the traumatic effects that witnessing violence can have on children , while increasing funding for support for the children .	about 63 children were present during 33 deaths from family violence between 2000 and 2011 .
no substantive action on any compromises to a hotly debated mining bill should happen this year with democrats controlling the state senate , the vice president of wisconsin 's largest business lobbying group said in a letter last week .	instead , interested parties should wait until after the november elections with the hope that republicans take back control with at least a two-vote majority , said wisconsin manufacturers and commerce vice president jim buchen in the letter to kennan wood , the executive director of the wisconsin mining association .	the july 19 letter was obtained thursday by the associated press .	talks fell through earlier this year on a bill designed to allow florida-based gogebic taconite to open a $ 1.5 billion iron mine in northwest wisconsin .	at that time , republicans held a 17-16 majority in the senate , but moderate gop sen. dale schultz refused to go along with the version that passed the assembly .	mining company officials have promised the mine would create hundreds of jobs , but they want lawmakers to ease the regulatory path .	environmentalists fear the mine would devastate one of the state 's most pristine regions near lake superior .	it will take at least a two-vote republican majority in the senate to revive the bill that gogebic taconite wants , buchen said in the letter . "	at the end of the day the only logical goal of mining reform legislation is to get the gogebic taconite company to build a mine in wisconsin , " buchen wrote . "	pursuing legislation that does not work for them is a waste of time . "	buchen said " premature discussions will only make it more difficult to get an acceptable bill passed later if we find we have the votes . "	he specifically mentions democratic sen. bob jauch , who represents the area where the mine would be located , as someone talking about alternatives .	jauch , who for months has worked with schultz and others on the issue , reacted angrily to the letter . "	it reveals an arrogant , secretive , partisan approach by a business group that believes they and only they are entitled to know what 's good for wisconsin , " jauch said . "	we are not elected to serve to the dictates of the wmc or one company . "	jauch said his goal was to find a compromise bill that was fair and responsible to the public , not the demands of one specific company .	gov. scott walker said in may that he believed there was still hope to pass a bill this year , and that the previous version died because of politics driven by the recall drive against him and four republican state senators .	walker spokesman cullen werwie declined to comment about the letter from wmc , which endorsed walker in the recall and spent $ 4 million on his behalf .	there has been no response to the letter from wood as of thursday , said scott manley , wmc 's environmental policy director .	manley said the letter was sent to reiterate wmc 's feeling that all the compromises that could be made on the bill had already happened , so further negotiations would be fruitless . "	we remain optimistic that we can next session pass a mining bill that is going to create thousands of mining jobs and enormous investment in wisconsin 's economy , " manley said .	and if republicans do n't emerge with at least a two-vote majority following the november election ? "	then we 'll have our work cut out for us , " manley said .
the investment banker who helped lead the obama administration 's auto industry overhaul has agreed to pay $ 10 million to settle influence-peddling allegations in new york .	former " car czar " steven rattner admitted no wrongdoing as part of the deal , which was announced by state attorney general andrew cuomo on thursday .	cuomo 's office had filed civil lawsuits against rattner in november , accusing him of paying kickbacks to help his company land $ 150 million in state pension fund investments in 2004 and 2005 .	he denied the charges .	the attorney general had initially sought $ 26 million in fines and penalties and a lifetime ban from the securities industry .	the settlement announced thursday only bars rattner from doing further business with any public pension fund in the state for five years .	rattner , who just weeks ago called cuomo a bully and claimed his demand of a steep fine was politically motivated , released a conciliatory statement saying he was pleased to put the matter behind him . "	i apologize if during the course of this process there is anything i did that may have made reaching this agreement more difficult , " he said . "	i respect the work of the attorney general and his staff to ensure that the new york state common retirement fund operates properly and in the best interests of new yorkers . "	cuomo , who will become new york 's governor on jan. 1 , said the settlement " resolves the last major action " of a lengthy investigation into corruption among officials overseeing the pension fund .	eight people have pleaded guilty to criminal charges as a result of the case , including former state comptroller alan hevesi , who admitted taking campaign contributions and luxury vacations from a financier seeking a multimillion-dollar pension fund investment deal .	a long list of financial firms and money managers , including rattner , have agreed to collectively pay $ 170 million in civil penalties in connection with the investigation .	cuomo 's office and the securities and exchange commission claimed that those bankers and brokers essentially had paid kickbacks to influence the officials overseeing the pension fund 's giant investment portfolio , now valued at about $ 132.8 billion .	rattner was never accused of criminal wrongdoing , but the sec and cuomo said he tried to help his investment firm , the quadrangle group , land deals with the state by paying $ 1 million in unnecessary finders fees to hevesi 's top political consultant .	they said he also helped the brother of the pension fund 's chief investment officer get a dvd distribution deal for his stalled film project , a low-budget comedy called " chooch . "	rattner has previously agreed to pay $ 6.2 million to settle an sec lawsuit over his conduct .	that deal includes a two-year ban from the securities industry .	rattner , a former new york times reporter who made millions on wall street and became a highly respected policy adviser and campaign fundraiser for democrats , left the quadrangle group to help lead president barack obama 's auto industry task force in 2009 .	he left government after the efforts to restructure general motors and chrysler were completed in the summer of 2009 .	since then , he has been writing and promoting a book on his work on the auto industry and working as an unpaid financial adviser managing the personal fortunes of new york city mayor michael bloomberg , one of the world 's richest men .

the governor of maine is lending his support to transcanada 's proposed west-east pipeline , saying his state would welcome alberta 's oil .

a fungus that causes a deadly disease in bats has been detected inside maquoketa caves state park despite years of efforts to prevent it from reaching there , wildlife officials said wednesday .	a low level of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome was found in a hibernating big brown bat in one of the caves that was tested in march as part of a national study aimed at stopping the spread of the disease , the iowa department of natural resources said .	the disease has killed bats in the northeastern united states and canada , and wildlife officials have been trying to contain it .	they say healthy bat populations are important ecologically and economically , including for the agriculture industry , because bats provide pest control by feeding on harmful insects .	the fungus was not discovered in any of the 14 other bats that were swabbed at one cave in maquoketa , and dnr official daryl howell said in a news release it 's hard to say what the finding means because of the low level of fungus detected . "	it may be at a level low enough that it may not infect the bats at all or it could be just the beginning of an outbreak that we will see in the future , " howell said .	but for the agency and those who climb in the caves , howell said the presence of the fungus means " we now go from trying to prevent the fungus from getting into the cave to trying to prevent it from getting out . "	the maquoketa caves , for decades a popular recreational spot in eastern iowa , were closed for two years because of concerns about white-nose syndrome spreading to the 400 bats that hibernate there in the winter .	the caves were reopened this spring to those who get permits and go through a brief education session with dnr officials .	up to 10,000 people have gone through the educational program this year , the agency said .	dnr officials say they will add mats with disinfection solution that people will walk across after leaving the caves to decrease the odds the disease will spread to other caves and bat populations .	those who recently have visited other caves will walk across the mats before entering .	the disease spreads from bat to bat , but wildlife officials say the fungus may be carried to caves by humans on clothing and other items .	the syndrome is not known to pose a threat to humans , pets or livestock .	visitors to maquoketa caves will be warned not to visit other caves with clothing or gear that was used there .

@ by markeshia ricks air force times when several female airmen at bagram airfield in afghanistan were tapped for a mission last month , they had no idea they would be stirring the debate about women in combat .	on march 30 , the day before women 's history month ended , the members of the 389th expeditionary fighter squadron and 455th air expeditionary aircraft maintenance squadron became the first women on record to execute an all-female combat sortie from start to finish .	it took clever scheduling to pull off the mission for women 's history month , but it could n't have happened if the air force did n't have women serving in virtually all of its hundreds of career fields .	the only jobs still off limits to female airmen are combat air controller , air liaison officer , tactical command and control , pararescue and radio frequency transmission systems .	the air force is quick to point out it does n't ban women from combat but put the restrictions in place to comply with defense department policy .	soon , though , every air force specialty code could be open to female airmen if the pentagon acts on a recommendation from a commission charged with reviewing diversity issues in the military .	members of the first all-woman combat mission and many of their fellow airmen say the change would be ok with them .	one day last month , the executive officer of the 455th air expeditionary wing , maj. christine mau , and her wing commander , brig. gen. jack briggs , were looking at pictures of the 389th 's members when he pointed out how many women were in the aircrew . "	six females in an aircrew are very rare , " said mau during a telephone call from bagram . "	it 's crazy , really .	once he saw that it was women 's history month he thought it would be a good idea to celebrate with a flight of all women -- as long as we did n't have to flail around or bend over backward to make it happen . "	it was n't until after the mission was over that the women learned they had made history .	all-female flights have been organized in honor of women 's history month before , but none had ever had a female ground crew . "	the whole historic part of it is not something that any of us realized , " said mau . "	the historic piece came after the fact , when the wing historian told us .	we just thought it was a good way to celebrate women 's history month . "	in march , the military leadership diversity commission called on the defense department to allow women to be assigned to combat units since many female soldiers and marines are fighting in afghanistan already and to open additional direct ground combat career fields and units to women in all services .	the recommendation has defense secretary robert gates giving careful consideration to softening -- if not eliminating -- combat exclusion rules .

president barack obama is warning that failure to ratify a new arms control treaty with russia will undercut american leadership on scores of challenges it faces worldwide .	obama used his weekly radio and internet address saturday to plead with the senate to approve the treaty , a dearly held foreign policy priority in the waning days of congress ' lame-duck session .	obama said without action on the pact , known as new start , " we 'll risk undermining american leadership not only on nuclear proliferation , but a host of other challenges around the world . " "	ratifying a treaty like start is n't about winning a victory for an administration or a political party , " the president said . "	it 's about the safety and security of the united states of america . "	although the white house and senate democratic leaders have expressed confidence about prospects for ratification , the fate of the treaty is uncertain in the senate , where it requires a two-thirds vote for passage .	senators are juggling it along with other contentious issues obama wants to see completed before congress recesses for the holidays , including a repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gays in the military , and time is fast running out .	senators debated the treaty into the night friday , with republicans raising concerns that it would limit u.s. missile defense options , something the white house strongly disputes .	the treaty , signed by obama and russian president dmitry medvedev in april , would limit each country 's strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 , down from the current ceiling of 2,200 , and establish a system for monitoring and verification .	u.s. weapons inspections ended a year ago with the expiration of the 1991 arms control treaty .	all 58 senators in the democratic caucus are expected to back the treaty , but it needs republican votes to reach the necessary 67 votes .	a number of republicans are supportive , but others continue to express reservations , despite entreaties from the pentagon and prominent republicans outside congress , including former president george h.w. bush . "	every minute we drag our feet is a minute that we have no inspectors on the ground at those russian nuclear sites , " obama said . "	it 's time to get this done . "

sheryl thomas did n't expect to find herself in a men 's shelter .	five years ago , she said , " i was working with women ?	helping to counsel them through emotional problems so that they would be motivated to find their true selves . "	the women she counseled ran from those trying to escape poverty to others at " executive level , who were looking to make a change in a career , " thomas said . "	and i was working as a consultant going into agencies such as catholic charities and cleveland state , doing work with their people . "	then thomas altered her own path by going to work at the 2100 lakeside men 's emergency shelter , the largest in ohio , which has been administered since 2005 by lutheran metropolitan ministry . "	to end up here with 400 men was really a change .	but i was looking for a change .	i was going through a divorce .	i was at that period in my life where there was a little chaos . "	my plan was to come here and stay for a little while , " she said . "	i figured that would be something like a year .	four years later , i 'm still here . "	i fell in love with the place .	not the shelter ?	i fell in love with helping the men .	i enjoy being a change agent . "	thomas , 46 , is one of five women on a staff of 55 .	thomas first worked as community coordinator for one of the shelter 's six " communities , " trying to place working residents in better jobs .	she became associate director , and was named director of programs in november , helping form a structure to help men develop emotionally , mentally , financially , socially and sometimes spiritually . "	she was a clear and obvious choice to move up .	she 's continually proven herself , " said director michael sering . "	and this is the first time in awhile we 've had a full management team . "	they are dealing with more need than they 've ever seen .	last year , the shelter served 3,100 men , with the help of 2,100 volunteers ?	community assistance that helped make up for lost foundation money .	the limping economy has caused a significant increase in first-time homelessness and brought it to outer-ring suburbs . "	the image of homelessness portrayed in the movies is not entirely accurate , " thomas said .	the majority are " guys who are working hard to not be here again , " she said , noting that 50 percent are out within 30 days . "	when a man leaves this building , i tell him i do n't ever want to see him again . "	and i mean , really ?	who wants to stay in a shelter ?	this is not a hotel . "	by 3 p.m. on a recent raw weekday , more than two dozen men were lined up on the sidewalk outside 2100 lakeside , waiting for bunks to open at 4 .	men get dinner and breakfast before being sent out on their own in the morning .	but the shelter is bustling around the clock .	work is steady in the kitchen and laundry .	men who live in one of the shelter 's communities , such as one for veterans and one for those overcoming substance abuse , attend daytime classes and workshops .	others apply for jobs , search for housing , work to re-establish credit .	thomas puts in long days on what can only be called her own level .	she is 6 feet 2 and invariably wears heels that emphasize her long legs . "	how tall are you ? "	a new arrival asked , looking up . "	you 'd look good next to me ! "	thomas shook her head .	she is used to drawing second looks .	she chuckled and kept walking to an office so bright that a visitor might not notice it 's windowless .	the air is so fragrant it 's almost luscious .	thomas joked it used to smell " like feet . " "	i come in here and feel a little rejuvenated , " she said . "	i flaunt my girliness in here .

look out for some whacky results in the race for delegates in the republican presidential primaries and caucuses .	there might even be a state or two where the second-place candidate gets the most delegates , starting with tuesday 's caucuses in iowa .	new gop rules require states that hold nominating contests before april to award delegates proportionally .	that usually means a candidate who gets 40 percent of the vote gets 40 percent of the delegates .	but not always .	the rules give states a lot of leeway to define proportional , and some states have been pretty creative .	for example , in ohio , the candidate who gets the most votes in each congressional district wins three delegates .	ohio has 16 congressional districts based on the latest census , so 48 delegates will be awarded this way .	an additional 15 delegates will be awarded proportionally , based on statewide results .	candidates must get at least 20 percent of the statewide vote to qualify for these delegates .	under this system , it is possible in a close race for a candidate to narrowly win the most congressional districts ?	and the most delegates ?	but come in second in the overall statewide vote , said bob bennett , a member of the republican national committee from ohio .	early on , battles over small numbers of delegates wo n't get much attention because candidates are more concerned about winning contests and building momentum .	but if the race continues into late spring , like the 2008 battle between democrats barack obama and hillary rodham clinton , delegate totals become much more important .	a tight race could draw a lot of scrutiny over obscure issues like this : if you qualify for 7.5 delegates under a proportional allocation , do you round up to eight or round down to seven ?	( in ohio and other states you round up to eight .	in nevada , which is holding gop caucuses feb. 4 , party officials are still working on those details . ) "	all these rules are important in close races , " bennett said . "	if you have a blowout , a sure winner , they do n't matter as much . "	in most national polls , former massachusetts gov. mitt romney and former house speaker newt gingrich are the front-runners for the gop nomination .	in iowa , rep. ron paul of texas also is polling well , raising the possibility of a split vote .	the iowa caucuses on tuesday begin the process in that state that will result in 25 delegates being selected for the national convention .	at the caucuses , voters will cast ballots in a presidential straw poll , and those results will get the most attention on election night .	caucus-goers also will elect delegates to county conventions , who in turn will elect delegates to congressional district conventions and the state party convention in june .	these are the conventions where delegates to the gop national convention in tampa , fla. , are selected .	each of the four congressional districts will elect three delegates to the national convention .	they will also appoint two members to a slate committee , which will choose 13 additional delegates .	the slate is voted on at the party 's state convention in june .	the system puts a premium on getting the most votes in individual congressional districts .	if a candidate 's supporters can control a congressional district convention , they can choose national delegates and slate committee members who support their candidate .	in a tight , three-way race , it is possible for a candidate to narrowly win two of the four congressional districts ?	putting him or her in position to win the most delegates ?	but come in second in overall votes statewide . "	the delegates are going to reflect the division within the party itself , " said john ryder , a member of the republican national committee from tennessee who chaired the panel that wrote the new proportional rule . "	the end result is nobody comes out of a proportional state with a clear mandate , unless of course they do , which would only happen if a candidate generates commanding support among republican voters . "	a total of 2,286 delegates are slated to attend the republican national convention in august , and 1,144 will be needed to claim the nomination , according to the republican national committee .	no candidate can reach that total before april , though a dominant front-runner could build a commanding lead by then .	in the meantime , the primary calendar is full of quirks .	south carolina ( jan. 21 ) , and florida ( jan. 31 ) , will award all their delegates to the candidate who gets the most votes , even though they are holding their contests before april .	both states already lost half their delegates for holding early contests , so the state parties decided to make them winner-take-all .	the rnc says there are no additional penalties for violating the proportional rules .	michigan 's plan for awarding delegates is very similar to ohio 's .	but michigan , which holds its primary feb. 28 , lost half its delegates because it scheduled its primary before march 6 , also known as super tuesday .	gop rules allow only four states to hold nominating contests before super tuesday : iowa , new hampshire , nevada and south carolina .	and those states were n't supposed to schedule contests before february .	michigan started with 59 delegates , but now has only 30 .	nevertheless , party officials plan to award 56 delegates based on the primary ( the other three will be the state 's rnc members ) , and simply reduce each candidate 's total by half .	that poses several problems : half of 56 is n't quite 30 , and what if a candidate wins 25 delegates ?	do they get 12 or 13 ?	gop rules do n't allow fractions of delegates . "	we 'll work that out once we get closer to choosing the delegates who will go , " said matt frendewey , spokesman for the michigan republican party .
texas gov. rick perry vetoed 23 bills friday , including legislation that would have outlawed sending or reading text messages while driving .	lawmakers approved the texting ban last month , but perry called it an " overreach " and " government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults . "	perry also struck a handful of spending lines in the state budget .	he signed several bills , including much of the next two-year state budget .	that budget spent $ 50.4 billion in state money , but lawmakers are still wrestling with education spending in a special session . "	our state faced significant challenges as we began the legislative session in january , and i am proud texas will continue to live within its means while encouraging job creation and maintaining essential services , " perry said in a statement with the announcement of his decisions . "	there is still some work to be done by lawmakers , but i am confident the bills i have signed will strengthen our economic momentum moving forward . "	former house speaker tom craddick had pushed the texting while driving ban , touting it as a public-safety measure .	but the bill triggered more than a half-hour of debate on the house floor with opponents arguing the bill would amount to criminalizing drivers simply for receiving a text message while driving .	san antonio and el paso already have laws forbidding texting while driving , and at least 30 other states have enacted similar statewide bans . "	the keys to dissuading drivers of all ages from texting while driving are information and education , " perry said in his veto statement . "	i recommend additional education on this issue in driving safety and driver 's education courses , public service ads , and announcements , and i encourage individuals and organizations that testified in favor of the anti-texting language included in this bill to work with state and local leaders to educate the public of these dangers . "	perry also vetoed a measure that would have allowed candidates for public office to correct campaign finance filings without penalty within 14 days after a sworn complaint has been filed with the texas ethics commission .	another vetoed bill would have allowed transit buses in certain urban counties to drive on highway shoulders during peak traffic hours .	perry said it would have endangered motorists by not leaving an emergency lane .	perry set the known record for vetoes by a texas governor in 200 , when he infuriated the legislature by vetoing a record 83 bills .	he killed so many bills the night of june 17 , 2001 , the final day of bill consideration , that politicos dubbed it the " father 's day massacre . "	that was shortly after he had ascended to the governorship , when republican george w. bush resigned to become president .	four years later , in 2005 , perry issued 20 vetoes , the lowest number in a regular session since 1975 .	bush had far fewer vetoes during his tenure as governor .	his highest total for a legislative session was 38 in 1997 .

the national security agency has broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since congress granted the u.s. agency broad new powers in 2008 .	in one case , telephone calls from washington were intercepted when the city 's area code was confused with the dialing code for egypt .	most of the infractions involve unauthorized surveillance of americans or foreign intelligence targets in the united states , both of which are restricted by law and executive order , according to documents leaked by former nsa analyst edward snowden and first published thursday in the washington post .	they range from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interception of u.s. emails and telephone calls , the post said , citing a may 3 , 2012 , internal audit and other top-secret documents provided it earlier this summer .	in one of the documents , agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the justice department and the office of the director of national intelligence .	the post cited a 2008 example of the collection of a " large number " of phone records from washington-based phone numbers when a programming error confused the u.s. area code for the capital of 202 for 20-2 , the international dialing code for egypt and the city code for cairo , according to a " quality assurance " review that was not distributed to the nsa 's oversight staff .	the nsa also saw a large spike in the number of " roamers , " or overseas , phone calls wrongly tracked in the first quarter of 2012 , when those roamers traveled into the united states territory , which is outside nsa 's authority .	the may 2012 compliance report said the errors may have been due to tracking chinese targets who were visiting friends and relatives for the chinese lunar new year .	in another case , the foreign intelligence surveillance court , which has authority over some nsa operations , did not learn about a new collection method until it had been in operation for many months .	the court ruled it unconstitutional .	the nsa audit obtained by the post , counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection , storage , access to or distribution of legally protected communications .	most were unintended .	many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure .	the most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 americans and green-card holders . "	the number of ' compliance incidents ' is jaw-dropping , " jameel jaffer , the deputy legal director of the american civil liberties union , a human rights advocacy group , said in a statement emailed late thursday . "	at least some of these incidents seem to have implicated the privacy of thousands or millions of innocent people . "	the white house on friday declined to comment on the latest revelations about surveillance of americans and foreigners by the nsa .	it directed questions to the national security council , and nsc spokeswoman caitlin hayden directed questions to the nsa .	in a statement emailed to the associated press late thursday , nsa spokeswoman vanee vines said the number of incidents in the first quarter of 2012 was higher than normal , and that the number has ranged from 372 to 1,162 in the past three years , due to factors like " implementation of new procedures or guidance with respect to our authorities that prompt a spike that requires ' fine tuning , ' changes to the technology or software in the targeted environment for which we had no prior knowledge , unforeseen shortcomings in our systems , new or expanded access , and ' roaming ' by foreign targets into the u.s. , some of which nsa can not anticipate in advance but each instance of which is reported as an incident . " "	when nsa makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission , the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it , " vines said .	the nsa also offered a statement from john delong , nsa 's director of compliance , who said , " we want people to report if they have made a mistake or even if they believe that an nsa activity is not consistent with the rules .	nsa , like other regulated organizations , also has a ' hotline ' for people to report ?	and no adverse action or reprisal can be taken for the simple act of reporting .	we take each report seriously , investigate the matter , address the issue , constantly look for trends and address them as well ?	all as a part of nsa 's internal oversight and compliance efforts .	what 's more , we keep our overseers informed through both immediate reporting and periodic reporting . "	when asked why the post did not publish the story earlier , though it said it had the documents for months , spokeswoman kris coratti emailed friday that " it has taken some time to study them and understand the information they contain .

the u.n. security council first imposed sanctions against iran in december 2006 and has been ratcheting up the punitive measures since then in hopes of pressuring the government to suspend enrichment and start negotiations on its nuclear program ?	which it has refused to do .	the council has acted in response to reports from the international atomic energy agency , which is expected to release new details this week indicating possible secret work by iran to develop nuclear weapons .	it could lead to new sanctions .	here is a rundown of the four sanctions resolutions adopted thus far : ?	december 2006 : the council ordered all countries to stop supplying iran with materials and technology that could contribute to its nuclear and missile programs .	it also ordered countries to freeze the assets of 10 key iranian companies and 12 individuals related to those programs . ?	march 2007 : the council banned iranian arms exports and ordered countries to freeze the assets of 28 additional individuals and organizations involved in iran 's nuclear and missile programs .	it called for voluntary restrictions on travel by the individuals subject to sanctions , on arms sales to iran , and on new financial assistance or loans to the iranian government . ?	march 2008 : the council banned all countries from trading with iran in goods that have both civilian and military uses .	it authorized inspection of cargo suspected of containing banned items on planes and ships that are owned or operated by iran air cargo and islamic republic of iran shipping line .	it authorized financial monitoring of bank melli and bank saderat , called on all countries " to exercise vigilance " in entering into new trade commitments , and froze the assets of 12 additional companies and 13 individuals . ?	june 2010 : the council banned iran from pursuing " any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons , " barred iranian investment in activities such as uranium mining , and prohibited iran from buying several categories of heavy weapons .	it called on all countries to cooperate in the inspection of suspect cargo and to block financial transactions and ban the licensing of iranian banks if they have " reasonable grounds " to believe these activities could contribute to iranian nuclear activities .	the council also imposed sanctions on 40 iranian companies and organizations .	it added one individual to the previous list of 40 iranians subject to an asset freeze and banned travel for all of them .	oil exports , the lifeblood of iran 's economy , are not affected by sanctions because of opposition from russia and china , which have veto power on council decisions .
a jackson county judge accused of fixing tickets for himself and family among other misconduct was thrown out of office friday by the michigan supreme court .	the decision to remove district court judge james justin was 7-0 , although the supreme court 's three democratic justices did not sign onto the toughly worded 31-page opinion .	justin , a judge since 1977 , was accused of dismissing traffic cases after talking to people in the hallway or elsewhere outside court .	he also was accused of dismissing tickets for himself , his wife , friends and staff .	the michigan judicial tenure commission sought his removal .	justin 's " fixing of traffic tickets issued to himself , his family , and staff alone warrants the most severe of sanctions .	however , respondent 's substantiated misconduct is much more extensive , " chief justice robert young jr. said . "	the duration , scope , and sheer number of ( justin 's ) substantiated acts of misconduct are without precedent in michigan judicial disciplinary cases , " he wrote .	a message seeking comment was left with justin 's attorney , dennis kolenda , who believed a suspension was the appropriate penalty .

solar equipment manufacturers will struggle for the rest of the year with a sustained drop in panel prices , a goldman sachs analyst said tuesday .	prices have tumbled for the past few years as chinese manufacturers flooded the market with cheap solar systems .	analyst amy song said china appears committed to a " vicious circle " of aggressive investment despite international criticism and higher tariffs in the u.s. .	that will likely keep panel supplies high and prices low throughout 2012 , song said .	at 94 cents per megawatt , solar modules cost less than half of what they did three years ago .	goldman sachs expects prices to drop by another 27 cents , or 29 percent , to 67 cents per megawatt by 2013 .	song noted that demand for solar equipment has remained strong in germany , the world 's largest market for solar .	it 's expected to pick up in japan , which has recently installed a generous renewable energy incentive program .	but supplies will remain robust as long as china continues to prop up its solar industry with cheap loans , low taxes and free land . "	until we see a clear pullback in these local policies , the circle is likely to persist , " song said .	the u.s. already has called for higher tariffs on chinese solar in response to what it considers to be a flood of underpriced solar .	the european union could follow , and that could lead to additional expenses for chinese companies , song said .	song singled out yingli green energy as an investment risk , downgrading the chinese company to " sell " from " neutral . "	song said yingli could have trouble paying off an aggressive expansion in its manufacturing capacity .	yingli shares fell by 1.4 percent .	also tuesday , ldk solar co. posted a first-quarter loss of $ 185.2 million and cut its 2012 revenue forecast , after booking charges related to a plunge in solar panel prices and new anti-dumping regulations in the u.s. ldk solar 's shares fell 5.9 percent tuesday .	shares of other solar companies also dropped .	trina solar ltd. fell by 8 percent and suntech power holdings co. by 5.2 percent .	first solar inc. , the largest solar company , fell by 2.1 percent .

president barack obama is naming elizabeth warren a special adviser to oversee creation of a new consumer protection bureau , dodging a fight with senate republicans who view her as too critical of wall street to be confirmed as the agency 's chief .	obama had spoken glowingly of warren as a possible leader of the bureau , created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown .	but the white house feared her lack of support in the financial industry would have set the stage for contentious senate hearings that could have derailed her nomination .	the bureau will have vast powers to enforce regulations covering mortgages , credit cards and other financial products .	hours before obama 's official announcement , warren wrote in a post on the white house blog that the purpose of the bureau is to ensure that people should be able to read their credit card and mortgage contracts and " know the deal . " "	they should n't learn about an unfair rule or practice only when it bites them , way too late for them to do anything about it , " she wrote . "	the new law creates a chance to put a tough cop on the beat and provide real accountability and oversight of the consumer credit market . "	warren , a 61-year-old harvard university professor who describes herself as " not a washington person , " will report to both the president and treasury secretary timothy geithner .	because she is not being named the bureau 's permanent director , warren can assume her duties immediately .	warren designed the advisory role during long conversations with white house officials , a person familiar with her thinking said .	the person insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations .	warren has spent the past two years running the congressional oversight panel , charged with monitoring the treasury department 's handling of the $ 700 billion bank rescue fund known as the troubled asset relief program .	the financial regulation law that obama signed earlier this year gives the treasury department the authority to run the consumer protection bureau while the nomination of its director is pending .	control must be transferred to the new bureau within a year , but the secretary has the latitude to seek an additional six months to complete the creation of the agency .	that means warren could perform her new duties into 2012 .	senate banking committee chairman chris dodd , who has questioned whether warren would have enough support to win confirmation , said thursday the white house was within its rights to name warren as an adviser and expert .	but he added on bloomberg television , " we need a director .	we 've got to have someone who is confirmable .	the law requires that there be a director of this bureau of consumer financial protection and that that nominee be confirmed by the senate . "	asked whether warren would effectively be serving in that capacity , dodd replied : " you ca n't do that .	you 'll end up with too much opposition .	... i 'd be totally opposed to someone on a backdoor operation here .	we need to build consensus to this bureau . "	obama plans to eventually name a permanent director , though an announcement is n't thought to be imminent .

the missouri veterans commission poorly communicated with veterans when handling pension and disability claims , according to auditor tom schweich 's report released wednesday .	schweich 's office found the veterans service offices properly handled pension and disability claims but repeatedly failed to inform veterans about what actions they took .	the audit follows seven complaints from federally elected officials .	in one complaint , a veteran called the office repeatedly over the course of three years to check the status of a denied claim .	the veteran mistakenly asked about an appeal to the case , which never was filed .	the case instead had been reopened and was under review .	the audit found the office correctly handled the claim but did not give the veteran any written notification of their actions .	commission spokesman daniel bell said the office now uses written communication forms to give details to veterans or their guardian on their cases .	it also plans to include contact information and availability for service officers in a written compliance form given to veterans .

"	we have really good outreach in minnesota , iowa and nebraska , and it 's a lot less expensive when you 're driving instead of flying .	we get most of our kids in the surrounding states , and the ones we get from further away we typically have a pipeline of people we can trust that can help keep costs down , too .	i do n't see our strategy changing .

"	you have power of one when you have one representative .	you 've got their focus , you 've got their attention ... but i understand , " waller said .	yet , the house 's plan to draw the 8th congressional district north into jefferson county has generated criticism from republican state lawmakers who represent southeastern missouri .	away from st. louis , the house and senate maps extend republican rep. sam graves ' 6th congressional district from northwestern missouri east to the mississippi river .	it also would take in a swath of jackson county .	the 5th congressional district in kansas city would gain parts of clay county and go east to several largely rural counties .	the 4th congressional district in the senate map would extend east from the kansas border and get boone county , which is home to the university of missouri-columbia .	also tuesday , two state commissions started work on redrawing the boundaries for the 163-member house and 34-member senate .	commission members were sworn in tuesday , chose their officers and set public hearings .	the missouri constitution requires the commissions to redraw legislative boundaries , and the 10-member senate panel and 18-member house commission have an even split between republicans and democrats .	the panels plan public hearings april 28 in jefferson city , may 23 in springfield , may 24 in kansas city and may 25 in st. louis .	former democratic lawmaker doug harpool is the chairman of the senate commission and former democratic lt. gov. joe maxwell is the chairman of the house commission .	republican john maupin is the vice chairman of the senate panel and the house commission 's vice chairwoman is republican ann wagner , who was the ambassador to luxembourg and is considering whether to run for the u.s. senate .	a newly formed group that focused on state legislative districts is urging the commissions to develop more politically competitive seats .	bob johnson , a former republican lawmaker and the group 's president , said too many state legislature races have essentially been decided before the general election and that limits the potential for independence among state lawmakers .

"	nancy-ann deparle , the white house health care reform advisor , said the latest version of the legislation includes principles that blue dogs called for last year .	democrats unveiled the legislation thursday . "	they wanted long-term cost containment .	they wanted something like the tax on high-cost plans , " said deparle , who described herself as a blue dog from tennessee . "	i 'm optimistic that many of the blue dogs who voted no are going to vote yes this time . "	melancon said he will not be will not be among them . "	meaningful reform would lower health care costs for those who have insurance now , while also expanding coverage to the millions without , " he said . "	and it would rein in exploding health care costs over the long term so our country and our citizens are not bankrupted . "	the landmark health care overhaul scheduled for a house vote sunday would extend insurance coverage to 32 million americans by 2019 .	this would be done primarily by expanding medicaid for the poor , providing subsidies for private insurance , and creating tax credits for small businesses to insure their employees .	most people would be required to buy insurance .	larger employers would have to offer it or face a penalty .	insurers could n't reject customers with pre-existing health conditions or impose lifetime limits on benefits .	there would be no government-run " public " insurance option , and illegal immigrants could n't use either subsidies or their own money to buy insurance on newly created health insurance exchanges .	some new rules and benefits would n't take effect immediately .	insurance exchanges , for example , would n't begin operating until 2014 .	but the legislation would immediately set up an insurance program for uninsured americans with pre-existing conditions .	the first procedural vote sunday could send the senate 's version of the health care bill to president barack obama to become law .	house lawmakers would then vote on a package of changes to the senate bill .	those changes , which the senate is expected to debate starting tuesday , would yield an overall health package that would cost $ 940 billion over 10 years , according to the congressional budget office .	that cost would be offset largely by penalties on individuals and employers who do n't buy insurance , a tax on high-cost plans , a higher medicare tax on the wealthy , and new fees and taxes on insurance companies and makers of drugs and medical devices .	the government would also cut subsidies to private insurers offering medicare advantage plans .	but it would increase medicare benefits by closing the " doughnut hole " gap in prescription drug coverage .	cbo analysts estimate the legislation would reduce the deficit by $ 138 billion over 10 years .	house and senate republicans blasted the plan .	house minority leader john boehner of ohio said republicans will do whatever they can to make sure the bill " never , never , ever passes . "	louisiana republican reps. charles boustany , john fleming , bill cassidy and rodney alexander said they will vote against it .	cao and republican steve scalise could not be reached for comment .	gop sen. david vitter also opposes the measure , saying in a statement it would cost too much and would be financed with " a half-trillion dollar cut to medicare and a half-trillion dollar tax increase . "	democratic sen. mary landrieu supports the legislation .	melancon said he supports provisions that would reduce fraud , extend coverage to young adults under their parents ' plans , ban insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and reduce health-care related infections .	southern blue dogs like melancon have little choice but to vote against the bill , said kevin unter , a political scientist at the university of louisiana in monroe . "	he needs to vote against health care if he wants to keep his seat , " unter said , adding that many congressional districts in the south are leaning more conservative . "	you 're seeing that kind of conservative trend , and this health care bill to conservatives is poison . "	unter said " it would be political suicide " for melancon 's senate campaign if he votes for the legislation and vitter votes against it . "	that would be the only issue that vitter has to run on , " he said . "	melancon does n't want to give vitter any ammunition whatsoever . "	health care reform already is a campaign issue .	in a recent fundraising plea , vitter accused melancon of " paving the way for a government takeover of health care . "	melancon said republicans and democrats can find enough in common to produce health care legislation . "	i still would like to see a bill that works , " he said .	contributing : maureen groppe , gannett washington bureau contact deborah barfield berry at dberry ( at ) gannett.com house lawmakers will hold a procedural vote sunday that could send a senate-passed version of health care reform legislation to president barack obama for signing .	they then plan to vote on a package of changes to the senate bill .	if they pass that package , it would go to the senate , which could begin debating it on tuesday .	democratic sen. mary landrieu supports the package of proposed changes . "	some lawmakers would have louisianians believe that scrapping a year of hard work and starting over is a way forward .	it is not , " she said in a statement . "	now is not the time to quit or start over ... the cost of doing nothing is too great . "	gop sen. david vitter opposes the package , saying in a statement it " fails to address the real problems of cost , quality and access . " "	this is just another mega-bill that grows the grip of government on our health care system and is full of policies the american people have already rejected , " he said . '	house lawmakers from louisiana plan to vote mostly along party lines on sunday .	here 's how they plan to vote and why : - rodney alexander , republican : no . "	the health care bill we are expected to vote on is a disaster waiting to happen and an expansion of an already broken program . "	- charles boustany , republican : no . "	we need a common-sense approach , but these 2,000-plus page bills simply are n't the way to lower health care costs or put patients in control .	congressional leaders and the president need to scrap these overhaul proposals and begin with bipartisan approaches from the start . "	- anh cao , republican : unavailable - bill cassidy , republican : no , " i want reform that controls costs , because only by controlling costs can you broaden access to quality care . "	- john fleming , republican : no " i can not support a bill that raises taxes , raises premiums , cuts medicare and lays an enormous unfunded medicaid expansion on my state just because it might include a few token republican ideas . "	- charlie melancon , democrat : no . "	meaningful reform would lower health care costs for those who have insurance now , while also expanding coverage to the millions without .	and it would rein in exploding health care costs over the long term so our country and our citizens are not bankrupted . "	- steve scalise , republican : no . "	it 's a government takeover , " said spokesman luke bolar . "	it 's new taxes , new mandates and cuts to medicare .	he believes with health reform we should fix the things that are broken and not blow up the entire system . "

an advisory panel on redistricting for seats in the maryland general assembly released a proposed map on friday that panel members say was designed to reflect an increase in the state 's minority population in the 2010 census .	the map released friday contains 12 districts that are majority african american , an increase from 10 districts that the court of appeals created in 2002 .	in addition to those districts , there are four districts that are majority minority ?	an increase from two in the last map .

hunched over a metal casting machine , chang chieh-kuan carefully guides a tiny copper mold into a hydraulic press .	seconds later he extracts a piece of lead type with the chinese character for " happiness . "	that 's one down , thousands more to go in a last-ditch effort by this 58-year-old craftsman to rescue the millennium-old world of chinese lead type from the advance of the digital age .	chang 's foundry is one of the last making traditional chinese characters the old way .	it 's time-consuming and labor-intensive , but chang says it brings out the grandeur of the characters . "	lead type makes an impression on paper that digital printing can not , " he said . "	it allows people to feel the weight and power of the character . "	in an age when chinese can text and tweet in their native script , and at a time when china has just surpassed japan to become the world 's second biggest economy , chang 's labor of love is a reminder of a much older china , one that invented movable type 400 years before it reached europe .	chinese script has no alphabet .	instead it consists of words made up of one or two characters , some of which can consist of up to 25 strokes .	to read a newspaper requires memorizing some 2,500 characters , a novel about 4,000 .	handwritten chinese , using brush and paper , is considered an art form and an indicator of its practitioner 's scholarship and aesthetic sensibility .	in communist china , many characters have been replaced by simplified forms to promote literacy , but purists say they lack the heft and balance of the originals .	taiwan , an island of 23 million people 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) off the chinese coast , still uses the traditional versions , regarding them as the heart and soul of chinese culture .	the older characters are also in use in hong kong , though no movable-type foundries exist there .	and everywhere , word processing is threatening to make the old skills extinct .	chang , a bespectacled perfectionist with a salt-and-pepper crewcut and a friendly smile , is out to save the family legacy and its 2 million pieces of lead type crammed in his workshop .	to do so , he is fighting fire with fire ?	digitizing 150,000 characters and enlarging them on a computer screen to help him perfect their lead-type versions and create a museum of printing where visitors can buy character molds as gifts .	when ri xing type foundry was established in 1969 , one of the partners was an uncle in the family who had worked for a newspaper printer for so long that he was able to write almost all the chinese characters with a calligraphy brush .	he did n't need a dictionary , chang said . "	in fact , he was the dictionary . "	back then , taipei had 5,000 printing shops .	forty years later , only 30 old-style establishments remain and ri xing is the last print foundry in the capital .	it has n't turned a profit in 10 years , and to pay the bills , chang sold the home he inherited from his father .	his determination has attracted a dozen spirited volunteers , many of whom had previously never seen lead type .	the copper molds he is making are in a font called kaishu that dates from the qing dynasty , china 's last imperial rulers , who were overthrown in 1911 . "	if i ca n't save this business ... it would be a big loss for taiwan , " chang said . "	as for humanity , the chinese-character movable letterpress is a huge cultural asset and could very well disappear . "

a large iron sculpture by chinese artist and activist ai weiwei that 's designed to prompt thoughts about how different people and cultures come together has been acquired by frederik meijer gardens & sculpture park in western michigan , the organization announced wednesday .	made of 99 iron pieces , the reddish sculpture called " iron tree " looks like a tree without leaves , but oversize stainless steel bolts that hold it together give it a mechanical , somewhat awkward appearance .	a mold for each piece was made from branches and other wood that the artist found being sold in southern china , said joseph becherer , vice president and chief curator at meijer gardens . "	before there was an ' iron tree ' there was a wooden tree and each piece of wood was from a different tree , " becherer said in a telephone interview .	ai , a sculptor , author and installation artist whose work is well-known internationally , is n't allowed to travel outside of china .	he spent nearly three months in prison in china in 2011 and last year directed the transformation of the former island prison of alcatraz into a tribute to the world 's political prisoners .	with " iron tree , " becherer said the more than 22-foot-tall sculpture 's size and detail help make it compelling . "	from a distance it registers as a tree , but when you get up close you realize that it 's composed of all these different parts , " becherer said .	meijer gardens worked with ai and his beijing studio and foundry to bring the sculpture to grand rapids , and becherer said the organization consulted closely with him on how to display the sculpture and landscape the site .	the acquisition was supported by fred and lena meijer .	a dedication ceremony is planned april 20 as part of events marking meijer gardens ' 20th anniversary .	following that , becherer plans a lecture about ai .	the acquisition and dedication are part of a series of events planned this year at the gardens and sculpture park .

c. david burgin , a longtime editor who gained a reputation as a troubleshooter for fading newspapers , died monday at his home in houston after a lengthy illness .	he was 75 .	burgin died of the effects of four serious strokes he had suffered since 1997 , said his wife , judy burgin .	burgin had served as editor-in-chief of seven u.s. daily newspapers , starting with new jersey 's paterson news in 1977 .	his first top management jobs came at the washington star , where he rose through the ranks of sports editor and city editor to assistant managing editor and hired such young talent as future new york times columnist maureen dowd and sportswriter ira berkow .	he talked two washington bartenders , future boston globe business writer chris reidy and future chicago tribune columnist steve daley , into trying newspaper work .	after getting his first assignment of running a newspaper in 1977 , as editor-in-chief of the paterson news in new jersey , the tribune co. hired him a year later to merge two of its san francisco bay area dailies into the peninsula times tribune , then later sent him to improve and expand the orlando sentinel .	in 1985 , hearst newspapers hired burgin to revive the fading fortunes of its flagship san francisco examiner .	in a 1996 profile published in the alternative publication sf weekly , burgin said he was fired seven months later after spurning an invitation to meet with the hearst corp. board .	after doing consulting work for a year , burgin took the offer of former washington star colleague william dean singleton to be editor-in-chief of the dallas times herald , which singleton had just bought from the times mirror corp. .	from 1986 to 1990 , burgin worked to try to save two singleton dailies from extinction , running the dallas daily for two years before the owner of its crosstown rival , the dallas morning news , bought and folded it .	singleton took the proceeds to buy the houston post , another struggling no. 2 newspaper in its market , and hired burgin as its editor-in-chief for the next two years .	in 1990 , singleton hired burgin to run a newspaper group he had just bought in the san francisco bay area .	singleton sold the post in 1995 to its dominant crosstown rival , the houston chronicle , which folded the post .	burgin began to acquire a reputation for trying to revive fading and dying newspapers , having been associated with so many of them , judy burgin said . "	he was brought in when there was trouble .	sometimes it worked , sometimes it was too late , " she said .	he remained as editor and vice president of the alameda newspaper group ?	which included such newspapers as the oakland tribune and later became part of the bay area news group ?	until 1997 when he suffered the first of a series of four serious strokes .	but convalescing easily bored him , his wife said , so he took over a book publisher , woodford publishing , and in 2000 rejoined the no-longer-hearst-owned san francisco examiner .	he was fired a year later .	his health continued to deteriorate , but he never lost his penchant for ideas for an increasingly struggling newspaper industry , judy burgin said . "	it was heartbreaking to him what was happening .	he had ideas for how to fix it , but he was too sick to act on them , " she said .	a memorial is tentatively scheduled for 2 p.m. sunday , june 22 , at the houston country club .

a judge has ordered a laramie man to answer a first-degree murder charge in connection with a woman 's slaying 42 years ago .	albany county prosecutors have charged 60-year-old lance david bean with murder in the 1972 slaying of sharon reher .	she was 20 when she was killed in her laramie apartment .	circuit judge robert a. castor ruled tuesday state prosecutors have enough evidence to charge bean in district court .	castor set bail at $ 750,000 cash or corporate bond .	laramie police detective joel senior testified that recent tests show the presence of dna from bean 's skin on reher 's clothing .	senior said samples of bodily fluids recovered from reher 's body were n't preserved .	defense lawyer vaughn neubauer argued there was no evidence bean killed reher and urged castor to drop the charge .
a controversial former board member at germany 's central bank , who had previously sparked a storm with a book disparaging muslim immigrants , is courting controversy again with a new book that takes aim at the euro .	thilo sarrazin argued that there is no intrinsic advantage to having a common currency as he presented his latest work , " europe does n't need the euro , " on tuesday . "	if it works , it has no significant advantages ; if it does n't , it has serious disadvantages , " he said .	sarrazin , a former official in the federal labor and finance ministries who for several years was berlin 's state finance minister , quit the bundesbank in 2010 amid an outcry over his previous book , the divisive bestseller " germany abolishes itself . "	sarrazin was criticized for claiming german society was being made " dumber " by muslim immigrants , among other comments .	extracts from the latest book have set off a new round of criticism ?	in particular a passage in which he criticizes left-wing opposition politicians in germany who advocate jointly issued european bonds , or eurobonds .	he writes that they not only fail to understand " the sources of german prosperity " but also are " driven by that very german reflex whereby penance for the holocaust and world war ( ii ) is only complete when we have put all our interests , even our money , in european hands . "	critics suggested that sarrazin was merely seeking controversy again for commercial gain . "	there is something very calculating about his method of acting as though there were bans on thinking and saying things about certain issues in germany , which he then flouts , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble ?	who is no fan of eurobonds ?	said at the weekend .	he described sarrazin 's arguments as " blatant nonsense . " "	in his greed for the greatest possible attention , he does n't even shrink from instrumentalizing and abusing the holocaust for his ends , " dieter graumann , the head of germany 's central council of jews , was quoted tuesday as telling the daily tagesspiegel .	while bailing out financially shakier members of the eurozone is unpopular in germany , mainstream political parties have broadly supported those efforts and there has been no sign of what anti-euro sentiment there is translating into a political movement .	sarrazin did n't spell out how long believes the euro can , or will , survive , and what should happen if not .	in his book , he writes that " either we give new life to the no-bailout principle , or we must embark on other roads toward a solution that do not rule out leaving the currency union . " "	none of the hopes that were linked to the euro ?	more growth , prosperity and jobs , more economic exchange between the euro countries , greater stability in the system or better protection against international crises , progress toward political union , " has been fulfilled , sarrazin asserted at his presentation . "	in terms of european policy , the euro is like the fourth , fifth or sixth suit you hang in your wardrobe , " he said . "	you can show up in a decent suit even if you only have three suits . "
rhode island is on a roll after residents here purchased two powerball tickets worth a total of nearly $ 400 million .	no one has come forward to claim rhode island 's second powerball jackpot of $ 60 million .	the winning ticket was sold at quickets convenience store in smithfield , state lottery officials announced thursday .	choosing the lump sum would give the winner $ 37 million , and the state would take $ 2.6 million in taxes .	earlier this week , 81-year-old louise white of newport stepped forward as the winner of the $ 336.4 million feb. 11 jackpot , which was the sixth-largest u.s. lottery prize .	white said she bought the ticket at a stop & shop supermarket in newport while stopping to purchase rainbow sherbet .	white opted to take a lump sum payment of $ 210 million , the highest ever for powerball , officials said .	the jackpot was the third largest in powerball history and the largest ever won in rhode island .	white 's winnings will provide the state with $ 14.7 million in taxes .	with the state facing a $ 117 million projected deficit next year , the money will come in handy , according to state director of administration richard licht . "	we 're happy to collect it , " he told lawmakers earlier this week . "	but it 's a one-time thing . "	eight powerball jackpots have been claimed in rhode island since the game began in 1992 .	though uncommon , it 's not unheard of for states to see multiple jackpot winners in the same year , according to chuck strutt , director of the multi-state lottery association , which administers powerball for the 44 states that sell tickets . "	back to back , though , that 's a rare thing , " strutt said .	indiana had the longest winning streak , with residents claiming three consecutive jackpots worth more than $ 60 million within a single month in 2003 .	pennsylvania has seen the most jackpots in the past decade , with residents winning 13 times .	north dakota , vermont , texas , virginia , washington and the u.s. virgin islands have never had a powerball winner , strutt said .	texas , virginia and washington began selling tickets in 2010 .	powerball was designed to offer the biggest prizes of any u.s. lottery game , he said , adding the game typically has 12-15 jackpots per year .

senate democrats sought to assure new yorkers and the state 's 200,000 employees sunday night that a government shutdown will be averted monday . "	we are not going to shut down government and risk the safety and livelihood of millions of new yorkers , " said senate democratic majority spokesman austin shafran .	shafran said sunday that an emergency bill to extend funding to keep government running for another week will be passed monday as state budget negotiations continue .	the announcement comes after a weekend of closed-door discussions .	gov. david paterson 's emergency bill , which appears to have forced an end to months of stalled budget negotiations , also includes more than $ 327 million in full-year cuts to mental health and social services programs as a way to address a spending plan that is more than two months overdue .	paterson was also optimistic sunday night that the bill would pass .	he said he spoke with all legislative leaders sunday . "	i 'm not confident of anything until it happens in albany , " paterson said , but added that he expects that come tuesday it will be " business as usual " in state government .	he said a government shutdown would create unthinkable pain for new yorkers , locking state workers out of their jobs , limiting services , and prompting lawsuits .	the legislature has been approving paterson 's weekly emergency spending bills for 10 weeks .	but last week paterson started include yearlong cuts , his way of extracting savings and passing pieces of the budget .	the emergency bills are special in that the legislature must approve them , including anything paterson adds such as yearlong budget cuts , or trigger a government shutdown .	the assembly , with a super majority of democrats , has passed the bills easily , but the senate ran into concerns when two democrats opposed paterson 's yearlong budget cuts .	democrats have a razor-thin majority in the senate .	democratic sen. ruben diaz sr. has repeatedly said he will vote against any more funding cuts for the poor and needy in his bronx district . '	republicans have not committed to breaking from full opposition to the bills , but clearly softened their stance saturday .	the republicans said they could see providing some votes , now that paterson included them in budget talks and adopted some of their spending cuts .	republicans were also getting pressured from their state worker constituents who would be without a paycheck if government shut down .	senate republican spokesman john mcardle had no comment sunday night .	sampson spoke with gov. david paterson through the weekend .	paterson said he had no commitments from lawmakers that his emergency spending bill would pass , but in appealing to what he called their sense of responsibility he said saturday that he had faith the bill would pass .	another democrat , sen. pedro espada jr. of the bronx , who said last week he might vote against the bill , announced sunday night that he will support .	it .	espada said he expects the bill will pass monday and that albany 's attention will focus fully on passing a 2010-11 budget that was due april 1 and includes a $ 9.2 billion deficit . "	the senate democratic leadership will deliver a budget in the next week or so that will include modest borrowing , responsible revenue enhancers , fair distribution of belt-tightening and real hope through job creation programs and some property tax relief to help get our state through these troubled economic waters , " espada said .	key elements holding up the budget have been paterson 's proposal to cut school aid by $ 1.4 billion or 5 percent , a $ 1 added tax per pack on cigarettes to create the highest cigarette tax in the nation , and disagreements over how much money the state should borrow , with as much as $ 2 billion in borrowing being proposed .	paterson has made it clear that borrowing to pay operating expenses is a big reason the state is in a fiscal crisis today , paying about $ 6 billion a year in borrowing costs a year .	but he said he does n't oppose doing so as a last resort .	the assembly 's democratic majority proposed to restore $ 800 million in school aid , but leaders there indicated that might not be possible given the depth of the fiscal problem and the length of the time without a budget .	paterson and legislative leaders are already agreeing to some borrowing through the state pensions system to spread imminent increases in payments for worker pensions over several years .
billionaire investor carl icahn said thursday he will try to buy all of the outstanding shares of cvr energy inc. through a tender offer , if the petroleum refiner 's board refuses to put the company up for sale .	the $ 30-per-share offer amounts to about $ 2.6 billion , based on the number of outstanding shares .	it represents a 8.7 percent premium over the company 's wednesday closing stock price of $ 27.60 .	the news sent cvr shares up $ 1.60 , or 5.8 percent , to close at $ 29.20 in heavy trading thursday .	they added another 46 cents in after-hours trading .	the offer also includes a " contingent value right , " that would entitle holders to an additional cash payment if the company is eventually sold for more than $ 30 per share .	icahn also said that he plans to nominate a slate of candidates to fill the nine director positions on the company 's board , setting up a proxy fight .	the activist investor said he still believes that the company should be put up for sale .	if that does n't happen before the tender offer expires in late march , icahn said he will go forward with the offer and a proxy fight in an attempt to get shareholders to back the sale of the company .	icahn is known for buying and shaking up struggling companies , with mixed success .	he said thursday that if the company were to be put on the market , it would draw interest from major oil companies .	icahn said he plans to start talks with some of those buyers and expects cvr to sell for at least $ 37 per share .	icahn said the tender offer is contingent on his slate of nominees being elected so they can eliminate cvr 's " poison pill " measure , which is intended to ward off unwanted attempts to acquire the company .	about 36 percent of the shares will need to be tendered in order for icahn , who already owns a stake in cvr , to take control .	cvr issued a statement late thursday saying it had received icahn 's unsolicited offer and would " respond as appropriate in due course .

gay married couples in iowa celebrated a landmark supreme court ruling wednesday that they said means same-sex couples finally will be able to realize benefits afforded to other married people .	same-sex couples have been able to wed in iowa since a 2009 iowa supreme court ruling legalized gay marriage .	but because the federal defense of marriage act defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman , those couples are blocked from collecting a range of federal benefits available to married people , such as filing joint taxes , receiving breaks on estate taxes and receiving social security survivor benefits .	chris patterson , who lives in west des moines with her married partner and two young children , said she felt relief and joy over the ruling . "	it was a long time coming and we both feel pretty amazing , " said patterson , 41 , who takes care of their kids . "	i think it 's pretty amazing for my family and my kids and i think it 's a step forward .	i 'm at loss for words . "	between 2009 and 2011 , about 1,500 same-sex couples from iowa were married in the state , the third to offer gay marriage .	more out-of-state couples also have wed in iowa , one of 12 states , plus the district of columbia , that have approved same-sex unions .	jason dinesen , an accountant and a board member for gay rights group one iowa , said that the lack of federal recognition for iowa 's same-sex married couples is a headache at tax time .	he said these couples must file separate federal taxes , though they can file jointly at the state level .	they also miss out on some other tax breaks ; for example if a gay couple gets health insurance from one partner 's employer , the coverage for the spouse may be considered taxable income . "	life will be a lot simpler at tax time when doma goes away , " dinesen said .	donna red wing , president of one iowa , agreed . "	we 're absolutely thrilled .	everything changes .	everything changes now , " said red wing , who is marrying her longtime partner later this year in iowa .	still , rep. dwayne alons , r-hull , said he would continue his efforts to end gay marriage in iowa .	during the recent legislative session , he introduced a joint resolution signed by 34 other house republicans proposing a change in the iowa constitution to ban gay marriage .	the measure did not survive a self-imposed legislative deadline this year , but could be revived in the next session .	alons said he thought the public should have the opportunity to vote on the issue , which would need to happen to make the change .	but he said the supreme court ruling would likely make it harder to move any bill forward . "	it 's going to have even a heavier lift in the future , " alons said .
when water begins to trickle down the streets of her coastal neighborhood , yoshiko takahashi knows it is time to hurry home .	twice a day , the flow steadily increases until it is knee-deep , carrying fish and debris by her front door and trapping people in their homes .	those still on the streets slosh through the sea water in rubber boots or on bicycle . "	i look out the window , and it 's like our houses are in the middle of the ocean , " says takahashi , who moved in three years ago .	the march 11 earthquake that hit eastern japan was so powerful it pulled the entire country out and down into the sea .	the mostly devastated coastal communities now face regular flooding , because of their lower elevation and damage to sea walls from the massive tsunamis triggered by the quake .	in port cities such as onagawa and kesennuma , the tide flows in and out among crumpled homes and warehouses along now uninhabited streets .	a cluster of neighborhoods in ishinomaki city is rare in that it escaped tsunami damage through fortuitous geography .	so , many residents still live in their homes , and they now face a daily trial : the area floods at high tide , and the normally sleepy streets turn frantic as residents rush home before the water rises too high . "	i just try to get all my shopping and chores done by 3 p.m. , " says takuya kondo , 32 , who lives with his family in his childhood home .	most houses sit above the water 's reach , but travel by car becomes impossible and the sewage system swamps , rendering toilets unusable .	scientists say the new conditions are permanent .	japan 's northern half sits on the north american tectonic plate .	the pacific plate , which is mostly undersea , normally slides under this plate , slowly nudging the country west .	but in the earthquake , the fault line between the two plates ruptured , and the north american plate slid up and out along the pacific plate .	the rising edge of plate caused the sea floor off japan 's eastern coast to bulge up ?	one measuring station run by tohoku university reported an underwater rise of 16 feet ( 5 meters ) ?	creating the tsunami that devastated the coast .	the portion of the plate under japan was pulled lower as it slid toward the ocean , which caused a corresponding plunge in elevation under the country .	some areas in ishinomaki moved southeast 17 feet ( 5.3 meters ) and sank 4 feet ( 1.2 meters ) lower . "	we thought this slippage would happen gradually , bit by bit .	we did n't expect it to happen all at once , " says testuro imakiire , a researcher at japan 's geospatial information authority , the government body in charge of mapping and surveys .	imakiire says the quake was powerful enough to move the entire country , the first time this has been recorded since measurements began in the late 19th century .	in tokyo , 210 miles ( 340 kilometers ) from ishinomaki , parts of the city moved 9 inches ( 24 centimeters ) seaward .	the drop lower was most pronounced around ishinomaki , the area closest to the epicenter .	the effects are apparent : manholes , supported by underground piping , jut out of streets that fell around them .	telephone poles sank even farther , leaving wires at head height .	as surrounding areas clear rubble and make plans to rebuild , residents in this section of ishinomaki are stuck in limbo ?	their homes are mostly undamaged and ineligible for major insurance claims or government compensation , but twice a day the tide swamps their streets . "	we ca n't really complain , because other people lost so much , " says yuichiro mogi , 43 , as his daughters examine a dead blowfish floating near his curb .	the earthquake and tsunami left more than 25,000 people either dead or missing , and many more lost their homes and possessions .	mogi noticed that the daily floods were slowly carrying away the dirt foundation of his house , and built a small embankment of sandbags to keep the water at bay .	the shipping company worker moved here 10 years ago , because he got a good deal on enough land to build a home with a spacious front lawn , where he lives with his four children and wife .	most of the residences in the area are relatively new . "	everyone here still has housing loans they have to pay , and you ca n't give away this land , let alone sell it , " says seietsu sasaki , 57 , who also has to pay off loans on two cars ruined in the flooding .	sasaki , who moved in 12 years ago with his extended family , says he hopes the government can build flood walls to protect the neighborhood .	he never paid much attention to the tides in the past , but now checks the newspaper for peak times each morning .	officials have begun work on some embankments , but with much of the city devastated , resources are tight .	major construction projects to raise the roads were completed before the tsunami , but much of that work was negated when the ground below them sank .	the constant flooding means that construction crews can only work in short bursts , and electricity and running water were restored only about two weeks ago .	the area still does n't have gas for hot water , and residents go to evacuee shelters to bathe . "	we get a lot of requests to build up these areas , but we do n't really have the budget right now , " says kiyoshi koizumi , a manager in ishinomaki 's roads and infrastructure division .	sasaki says he hopes they work something out soon : japan 's heavy summer rains begin in about a month , and the higher tides in autumn will rise well above the floor of his house .

state auditor mike foley launched his campaign for nebraska governor on thursday , pitching his experience as a public-spending watchdog and a well-known abortion opponent .	the former state lawmaker became the fourth republican candidate to join a fast-growing primary field , with more expected to enter in the coming weeks .	in his announcement at the capitol , foley promised to push for tax cuts and overhaul the state agencies that he has investigated for years . "	no one can deny that my tenure as state auditor has been marked by an aggressive and unrelenting pursuit of government waste and impropriety , " foley said , with his wife , susan , and their six children standing nearby .	he aimed much of his criticism at the nebraska department of health and human services , the state 's largest agency , with 5,000 employees and a $ 3 billion annual budget .	he vowed to dismantle the department " brick by brick " and rebuild it in a way that 's more efficient .	foley also pointed to his reputation as an abortion opponent who does n't shy from emotional public debates .	for instance , foley said he would have supported a hotly debated law from two years ago that extended state-funded prenatal care to the unborn children of women who were living in the united states illegally . "	i do n't whisper my pro-life convictions , " he said . "	i live them . "	foley was introduced by u.s. rep. jeff fortenberry , a longtime friend who pointed to foley 's experience as a conservative state auditor . "	he has demanded that tax money be spent fairly and frugally , " fortenberry said . "	he has demanded smart and effective delivery of important public services to the people of our state , particularly those most in need .	i can say without reservation that he is perhaps the best state auditor that nebraska has ever had . "	foley lived in washington for 20 years before he moved to nebraska .	he spent five years as an analyst for the nebraska public power district before he was elected in 2000 to represent a south lincoln district in the legislature .	he was elected auditor in a statewide election in 2006 , and claimed nearly 80 percent of the statewide vote in his 2010 re-election bid .	three state lawmakers ?	sens. charlie janssen , tom carlson and beau mccoy ?	have already entered the race .	omaha businessman and 2006 u.s. senate nominee pete ricketts is also expected to announce soon .	the candidates are running to replace republican gov. dave heineman , who is ineligible to seek re-election because of term limits .	candidates are also circling an open seat held by u.s. sen. mike johanns , who is retiring .	foley 's decision to run for governor leaves a third statewide seat unfilled ?	the state auditor 's ?	which could inject even more candidates into the 2014 campaign season .	state law prohibits candidates from running for two offices at the same time .	foley also promised to reach out to rural voters , whom he described as " the backbone " of nebraska 's economy .	he acknowledged that he lacks expertise in farm and ranch issues , but said he would surround himself with experts who understand both industries . "	i 'm not going to lie to you .	i do n't have a pair of cowboy boots and bib overalls in my closet , " he said .
the company in september admitted to have cheated on u.s. diesel emissions tests with the help of software installed in engines .	the software was built into 11 million cars globally , about 500,000 of which in the u.s. , from 2009 to 2015 .	it has so far confirmed to have cheated only on the u.s. tests , which are more rigorous than european ones for the polluting emission nitrogen oxide .	in an update on the company 's investigation in the case , chairman hans dieter poetsch said engineers in 2005 were unable to find a technical solution to u.s. nitrogen oxide emissions within their " timeframe and budget " and came up with the software that manipulated results when lab testing was done .	later , when a technical solution became available , it was not employed , poetsch said . "	we are not talking about a one-off mistake , but a whole chain of mistakes that was not interrupted at any point along the time line , " he told reporters at volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg , germany .	he said volkswagen was " relentlessly searching for those responsible " and that those who were would be brought to account . "	we still do not know whether the people who were involved in this issue from 2005 to the present day were fully aware of the risks they were taking and of the potential damage they could expose the company to , but that 's another issue we will find out , " he said .	ceo matthias mueller said the investigation so far had revealed that " information was not shared , it stayed within a small circle of people who were engineers . "	poetsch confirmed the company had suspended nine managers for possible involvement in the scandal .	he said there are so far no indications that board members were directly involved , but the company 's probe is ongoing and broad . "	this is not only about direct , but overall responsibility , " he said .	he said the investigation has so far analyzed data from laptops , phones and other devices from 400 employees .	more than 2,000 have been informed in writing that they can not delete any data in case it becomes relevant to the investigation , he said .	external auditors have already gone through 102 terabytes of data , which he said was the equivalent of 50 million books . "	i 'm not saying all of those people are under suspicion , but what it means is that on computers , sim cards , or usb sticks there might be information that could be important , " he said . "	we still believe that only a comparatively small number of employees was actually actively involved in the manipulations . "	mueller said that the scandal had so far not caused the massive slump in business that some had feared earlier . "	the situation is not dramatic , but as expected it is tense . "	sales in the u.s. fell nearly 25 percent in november , the first month to show the full impact of the scandal .	figures for the european union are due next week . "	we are fighting for every customer and every car . "	he suggested that the company was not considering any cuts to fulltime jobs , but that it might have to shed some workers with fixed-term contracts . "	temporary jobs are a tool of ensuring flexibility , that is not new , " he said . "	if changes come to our production , then this may have an impact on the number of temporary workers . "	mueller said volkswagen 's finances are strong enough , however , that the company does not have to consider selling any units to cope with the costs of the scandal as has been speculated by some .	the automaker has estimated the scandal would cost 6.7 billion euros , though analysts expect that figure to ultimately be much higher .	to help restore confidence in the company and " prevent something like this from ever happening again , " poetsch announced that volkswagen was instituting new , more stringent and transparent emissions testing for all of its vehicles .	he said volkswagen would go beyond lab tests -- so far the norm in the u.s. and europe -- had proved too easy to cheat . "	our emissions tests will , in future , be verified by external and independent third parties , " he said . "	we will also be introducing universal on-road emissions measurements during real-life driving , and we hope that will help us win back trust . "	rising reported from berlin .

secretary of state hillary rodham clinton reiterated her support friday for ending the brutality and barbarity of mexico 's drug violence , saying it was in the united states ' interest to crack down on drug cartels that are behaving more like terrorists and insurgent groups .	clinton told a sold-out meeting of the nonpartisan commonwealth club in san francisco that she was surprised comments she made last month comparing mexico to colombia during its past cocaine wars had been critically received . "	this is one of the most difficult fights that any country faces today .	we saw it over the last couple of decades in colombia , " she said . "	we are watching drug traffickers undermine and corrupt government in central america , and are watching the brutality and barbarity of their assaults on governors and mayors , the press as well as each other in mexico . "	similar remarks clinton made before the council on foreign relations prompted obama , among others , to say that mexico was in much better shape politically and economically than colombia was during the 1980s .	government officials in mexico also rejected the comparison .	elaborating on her analysis friday , clinton said the united states was prepared to provide mexico with black hawk helicopters , training and equipment for police , and advice on building an independent judiciary and effective corrections system . "	every american should support what the government of mexico is trying to do and send a very clear message that we will be their partners and they do need to win this struggle against the drug traffickers , " she said . "	these drug cartels are now taking on a lot of the attributes of these terrorists and insurgent groups we see around the world .	for the first time they are using car bombings , you see them being much more organized in a kind of paramilitary way . "	clinton described her friday speaking engagement as only her third domestic public appearance since joining president barack obama 's cabinet last year .

gov. bob mcdonnell hawked his plan to privatize virginia 's state-owned liquor stores to a savvy crowd in this city on the tennessee border .	for years , cheaper booze prices south of state street ?	the tennessee-virginia line ?	have enticed many a whiskey shopper south of the border to the mom-and-pop stores instead of virginia 's alcoholic beverage control outlets .	just one block from the state line , mcdonnell used the last of his eight town hall-style forums to advance his abc privatization idea and other proposed government reforms .	the first-year governor wants to sell the 332 government-owned stores and use profits he estimates at $ 300 million to $ 500 million to maintain virginia 's underfunded highway system .	democrats who control the state senate balk at the proposal , questioning mcdonnell 's projected one-time windfall and warning that the state could lose a reliable source of $ 230 million in annual revenue .	the only way the state could match the money that the tightly controlled state system brings in , scoffed senate majority leader richard l. saslaw , is to triple the sales of liquor , putting more drunks on the roads the state seeks to fix .	and some republican social conservatives fret over a less-regulated , tennessee-style system where stores tend to flourish in seamy areas of large cities .	concerns also linger , until mcdonnell submits final details of his plan on sept. 8 , about who would control the lucrative liquor wholesaling business .	mcdonnell , however , counters that " it 's not a core function of government to sell jim beam or grey goose . "	virginia , he said , is one of only 18 states with a government-controlled monopoly over distilled spirits .	he notes that virginia government went into the booze business in 1934 , as the nation emerged from prohibition .	he rejects claims that the budget will suffer from free market liquor .	and a powerpoint presentation playing out on a large screen behind him shows a study that shows binge drinking wo n't increase as a result . "	tennessee is a private sector ( liquor ) state , and they have less of an incidence of binge drinking " than virginia , he told about 150 people in the bristol , va. , public library .	beer distributor tom hairston , whose business could face new competition , said virginians consume 21 percent less hard liquor than the national rate . "	do we really want to catch up ? "	he asked mcdonnell during the forum .	but james covey of radford supported privatization , particularly if the proceeds are used to modernize outdated stretches of interstate 81 , a ribbon of freeway that curls through western virginia and is among the oldest stretches of the nation 's interstate system .	on the streets of this two-state community , price tends to sway purchase decisions .	jeffrey arnold , a virginian who lives a few feet from the state line , stopped at a virginia abc store in bristol for a bottle of vodka , something he said he usually does in tennessee . "	well , their prices are just cheaper , " said arnold , 37 . "	but i like now they have more brands here , and it 's a little more open .	i feel a little safer . "	ben henderson , the afternoon clerk at the belmont package store in a shopping center full of vacant stores in bristol , tenn. , sees plenty of drinkers choose his store because prices are lower and because it is open until 11 p.m. , two hours after virginia 's abc stores close . "	on average , we have better prices , but they ( virginia 's stores ) have a better selection , " said henderson , 22 , who is working his way through a local community college . "	our prices average about $ 4 or $ 5 less , particularly on the big stuff , the large bottles , " he said .	a spot check proved henderson right , at least on popular labels .	a 1.75-liter bottle of stolichnaya vodka was $ 34.99 at his tennessee store .	six miles away , at a virginia abc store , it was $ 42.90 .	other comparisons of 1.75-liter bottles : captain morgan spiced rum , $ 28.99 in tennessee , $ 32.95 in virginia ; jack daniel tennessee straight whiskey , $ 42.99 in tennessee , $ 47.95 in virginia ; j&b scotch , $ 39.99 in tennessee , $ 39.90 in virginia .	jose cuervo gold tequila cost $ 29.99 in tennessee , but in virginia it was on sale for $ 37.90 , down from the normal list price of $ 39.90 .	norman booher has lived on the tennessee side of bristol all of his 60 years .	for him it 's an easy choice , based mostly on cost . "	i do n't know why , but it used to be cheaper in virginia , " booher said after he paid for his fifth of tennessee 's own jack daniel black label . "	i 'd just assumed that because in virginia the state owns it , the state got better deals ( from the distillers ) because they bought more . "	mcdonnell 's tentative plan would privatize the wholesale and retail operations .	virginia now controls all liquor distribution , receiving it from distillers at a central warehouse in richmond , then dispatching the alcohol to stores statewide .

" "	the band perry " debuted at no. 2 on the country charts and no. 4 on the all-genre billboard 200 .	surprising ?	perhaps .	but it 's not so shocking once you learn that the group is no flashing meteor .	they 've had over a decade of preparation combined with the hard sell from a new venture backed by big machine 's scott borchetta to secure a breakout moment . "	the band perry " is the first release from republic nashville , a partnership between borchetta 's growing independent line and universal republic .	the band had the full attention of new label president jimmy harnen , who traveled with them on their radio tour last year .	harnen hit 87 radio stations with the band from october to january , laughing all the way .

" "	for us it was really cool , " the 27-year-old kimberly said . "	radio got to see that commitment , but also we got to know the head of our label really , really well . "	the perrys started playing live gigs from a young age .	kimberly put together her first band at 15 and reid and neil , now 21 and 20 , were opening up for her at the ages of 10 and 8 in their own band , the mobile music connection , so-named because they lived in mobile , ala. , at the time .	their mother and father were closet musicians and more supportive than your average parents .	their father , steve , acted as their first booking agent , and he was aggressive . "	he would book us in every place he could find , " neil said , " restaurants , churches , festivals , fairs ... " " the side of the road , " kimberly joked .	they played a little bit of everything from led zeppelin to southern rock . "	they all had these matching bowl cuts and they were 3 feet tall , " kimberly said . "	they were so cute . " "	we called ourselves mini-beatles , " reid said .	by the time the boys were in their teens they found themselves in need of a singer and kimberly needed a band , so they joined forces .	they were recruited for the new faces of country tour in 2005 , playing acoustic in-store shows at walmarts across the country . "	we actually became the band perry in the lingerie departments of walmart , " kimberly joked .	three years later , garth brooks ' manager , bob doyle , hooked the band up with producer paul worley to start honing their sound .	the band cut its own music before approaching labels to retain some control over its future and establish a baseline .	it sounds easy : how to make a splash in country music in five easy steps .	but it 's been anything but . "	we just celebrated 12 years on the road together , and you know what ? "	kimberly asked . "	there 's just a lot of blood , sweat and tears that go into taking a band and raw talent from point a and actually getting it to point b in front of people 's eyes and ears .	so it 's just really been amazing to think about all these steps we 've taken this last decade .

gov. bill haslam said thursday that while the crime rate is showing an overall decline in tennessee , instances of aggravated assault , prescription drug abuse and domestic violence remain major concerns for his administration .	the republican governor said at a meeting of more than 400 public safety officials that domestic violence accounts for about half of all crimes committed in the state each year .

"	haslam this year introduced and signed into law a measure to require mandatory jail time for repeat convictions for domestic violence .	he said it 's too soon to tell if the change has made a significant difference , but that there 's reason to be optimistic . "	i 've got to believe that will have an impact as we move forward , " he said . "	it 's a substantial message that if you 're a repeat offender , you 're going to go to jail regardless of who you are . "	the governor said several members of his cabinet will continue to work with law enforcement to seek ways to reduce violent crimes and drug abuse . "	if you look at the drug-related numbers of those assaults , it 's pretty high number , " he said . "	there 's a mental health component for some of those as well . "

republican governors who 've balked at creating new private insurance markets under president barack obama 's health care overhaul may end up getting stuck with the very thing they 're trying to avoid .	unless mitt romney wins in november , states that have n't set up the required insurance could find washington calling the shots on some insurance issues the states traditionally manage , from handling consumer complaints to regulating plans that will serve many citizens .	it could turn into a political debacle for those who dug in to fight what they decry as " obamacare . " "	you 're kind of rolling the dice if you think ( obama 's health care law ) will go away , " said kansas insurance commissioner sandy praeger , a republican .	if romney ca n't make good on his vow to repeal the overhaul , " you are just giving up a lot of authority . "	the law envisioned that states would run the new markets , called exchanges , with federal control as a fallback only .	but the fallback now looks as if it will become the standard option in about half the states ?	at least initially .	it would happen through something called the federal exchange , humming along largely under the radar on a tight development schedule overseen by the health and human services department in washington .	exchanges are new online markets in which individual consumers and small businesses will shop for health insurance among competing private plans .	the supreme court 's health care decision left both state exchanges and the federal option in place .	the exchanges are supposed to demystify the process of buying health insurance , allowing consumers to make apples-to-apples comparisons .	consumers will also be able to find out if they 're eligible for new federal subsidies to help pay premiums , or if they qualify for expanded medicaid .	it 's all supposed to work in real time , or close to it , like online travel services .	open enrollment would start a little over a year from now , on oct. 1 , 2013 , with coverage kicking in the following jan. 1 .	eventually more than 25 million people are expected to get coverage through exchanges , including many who were previously uninsured .	as exchanges get more customers , competition among insurance plans could help keep costs in check .	but only 14 states and washington , d.c. , have adopted plans for their own exchanges : california , colorado , connecticut , hawaii , maryland , massachusetts , nevada , new york , oregon , rhode island , utah , vermont , washington and west virginia .	some could still backtrack .	kentucky and minnesota are pushing forward with their own exchanges , and others may be able to partner with the federal government .	states face a jan. 1 , 2013 deadline for washington to sign off on their plans .	meanwhile , the federal exchange is advancing .	hhs contractors are working feverishly to design and test computer systems that would make the federal exchange come alive .	it 's a top priority for the administration , which is guarding the details closely .	estimated price tag : at least $ 860 million .	the government is " on track in moving aggressively to set up this market structure , " mike hash , the hhs official overseeing the effort , told industry representatives , state officials and public policy experts at a recent bipartisan policy center conference . "	we 're on track ... to go live in the fall of 2013 . " "	i think the pressure is on them to deliver , and i fully expect they will , " said jon kingsdale , who was the founding director of the nation 's first health insurance exchange , created under then-gov .	romney 's health care overhaul in massachusetts .	now a consultant to states , kingsdale says he expects the federal exchange to look very much like the one already operating in his home state .	there will be a website , and you 'll be able to put in your zip code and get a list of available health plans .	there will be a section where you can find out if you qualify for subsidies , or whether you might need to look at medicaid .	there will be cost calculators to allow you to compare different levels of coverage : platinum , gold , silver and bronze .	there will be tools that allow you to see if your doctor or hospital is with a particular plan .	in an interview , hhs official hash said the government is undaunted by the prospect of running exchanges in half the states or more . "	what we are talking about building here is a system that is really using 21st century technology , and it 's not dependent like in the past on bricks and mortar or how many ( federal employees ) you have , " said hash . "	information technology produces the opportunity for efficiency .	it 's much more easily scalable if you need to do it for a larger number of individuals . "	paper applications also will be accepted .	and hash expects people will have plenty of help to navigate the system , from volunteers to insurers advertising to reach new customers .	the government has awarded two big technology contracts for exchanges .	virginia-based cgi federal inc. is building the federal exchange .	maryland-based quality software services inc. is building what 's called the federal data services hub , an electronic back office that will be used by the federal exchange and state exchanges to verify identity , income , citizenship and legal residence .	running the data hub will involve securely checking sensitive personal information held by agencies such as the social security administration , internal revenue service and homeland security department .	technology experts say that 's a challenge but not insurmountable .	hhs rejected an associated press request to interview the contractors .	the administration says consumers should not notice any difference between the federal exchange and marketplaces run by the states .	but state regulators disagree . "	i think we would be giving up something , " said praeger , the kansas insurance commissioner . "	it would have much more of a federal flavor than a kansas flavor . "	praeger wants kansas to have a state-run exchange , but gop gov. sam brownback and republican state legislators are opposed .	if opponents prevail , the state will have a federal exchange .	but conservatives are raising yet another argument in hopes of shutting down federal exchanges .	led by cato institute economist michael cannon , several opponents say the letter of the complex law precludes the government from subsidizing coverage through the federal exchange .	they say the law allows only tax credits to help consumers pay premiums in state exchanges , not the federal exchange , and that 's the way congress intended it .	if states do n't set up exchanges , that would starve the health care overhaul of money and cause it to unravel , they contend .	but the irs and two nonpartisan congressional units ?	the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxation ?	conducted their own analyses and concluded that subsidies are available in both types of exchanges , federal and state-run .	senate finance committee chairman max baucus , d-mont. , one of the law 's principal authors , says that 's exactly how congress intended it .	at the national association of insurance commissioners , spokesman scott holeman says , " at this time , we do n't have any reason to question the federal government 's interpretation of the statute . "	the dispute may wind up in court but probably would n't get resolved until after the exchanges were up and running .

a federal judge on wednesday halted two executions in texas , declaring that the state 's prison system must disclose to defense attorneys more information about the supplier of a new batch of lethal-injection drugs .	u.s. district judge vanessa gilmore issued a temporary injunction halting the executions of tommy lynn sells , a convicted serial killer who was set to die thursday , and ramiro hernandez-llanas , another inmate scheduled to die next week .	texas officials have insisted the identity of the drug supplier must be kept secret to protect the company from threats of violence and that the stock of the sedative pentobarbital falls within the acceptable ranges of potency .	defense attorneys say they must have the name of the supplier so they can verify the quality of the drug and spare condemned inmates from unconstitutional pain and suffering .	questions about the source of drugs used to carry out lethal injections have arisen in several u.s. states in recent months as numerous drugmakers ?	particularly in europe , where opposition to capital punishment is strongest ?	have refused to sell their products if they will be used in executions .	that has led several state prison systems to compounding pharmacies , which are not as heavily regulated by the food and drug administration as more conventional pharmacies .	gilmore ordered the texas department of criminal justice to provide defense attorneys with information about the supplier and how the drug was tested .	lawyers for the state planned to appeal .	last month , the u.s. supreme court rejected similar arguments about execution secrecy in a missouri case , and the condemned prisoner was put to death .	gilmore 's ruling " honors the importance of transparency in the execution process , " said maurie levin , an attorney for the inmates . "	and the order makes it clear this last-minute litigation and stays of execution would not be necessary if ( the prison agency ) had not ignored the rule of law and tried to shield this information from the public and the light of day . "	texas prisons spokesman robert hurst said the agency had no comment because the matter was still pending in court .	since obtaining a new supply of pentobarbital two weeks ago , the department of criminal justice had cited unspecified security concerns in refusing to disclose the source and other details about the sedative it plans to use to put inmates to death . "	as a result , the state 's secrecy regarding the product to be used for lethal injection has precluded ( the inmates and their attorneys ) from evaluating or challenging the constitutionality of the method of execution , " gilmore wrote in a five-page opinion .	a batch of pentobarbital texas purchased from a compounding pharmacy in suburban houston expired at the end of march .	the pharmacy refused to sell the state any more drugs , citing threats it received after its name was made public .	that led texas to its new , undisclosed supplier .	levin filed an open-records request on march 11 seeking the name of the supplier from the department of criminal justice .	last week , defense attorneys won an order from a state court that directed prison officials to identify the new provider of pentobarbital , but only to them .	the texas supreme court put that order on hold on friday and set a deadline for briefs that will arrive after the sells and hernandez-llanas ' scheduled execution dates .	the defense turned next to the federal courts , which resulted in wednesday 's ruling .	sells , 49 , was convicted of killing a 13-year-old south texas girl asleep at her home in 1999 .	kaylene harris was stabbed nearly two dozen times and had her throat slashed .	a 10-year-old friend also was attacked but survived .	sells confessed to the slaying and has been tied to more than 20 others around the nation .	he has claimed responsibility for as many as 70 murders .	hernandez-llanas , 44 , a mexican national , was convicted of killing a kerrville-area rancher , glen lich , 48 , who had employed him .

the university of california , irvine has made numerous improvements to remedy unsanitary conditions and poor oversight at its dialysis center found during a surprise state inspection last fall .	the los angeles times reported monday that state inspectors who visited in november found rusted equipment , blood spots on chairs and walls and nurses who did not change gloves while treating patients at the facility on the uc irvine medical center campus in orange .	if the infractions had not been remedied , the center faced losing medicare funding .	uc irvine spokesman john murray told the times the center has since hired a new medical director and nurse manager , retrained staff and overhauled equipment .	officials also submitted a plan of correction on friday to the california department of public health , as they were required to do to continue to receive medicare funding .	the facility , which was last inspected in 2003 prior to the november surprise inspection , was treating 124 patients at the time .	in a letter sent monday to uci medical faculty and staff , uci chief executive terry belmont and medical school dean ralph v. clayman stated that the center has a lower mortality and infection record than others in the state and across the nation .	uci 's annual observed mortality rate is 11 percent as compared to 18 percent in california and 20 percent nationally , they said .	the southern california renal disease council , which is sponsored by federal regulators , sent a letter in december to dialysis centers , including uci , saying federal regulators had received numerous complaints about cleanliness .	federal regulations require the state to inspect dialysis centers every three years , but the state department of public health has been unable to do so due to a lack of funding , spokesman ralph montano told the times .

the republican presidential race here has been thrown wide open two weeks before the first votes in the battle for the party 's nomination , as newt gingrich 's standing in the crucial state of iowa has been eroded by more than $ 1 million in negative advertising ?	much of it bankrolled by allies of fellow frontrunner mitt romney .	the former house of representatives leader 's slide in iowa mirrors his newfound troubles nationally , and it has boosted the confidence of romney , his chief rival , in the leadoff caucus state on jan. 3 .	with the iowa caucuses looming in two weeks , the race here is arguably anyone 's to win .	and the results will shape the rest of the state-by-state march to the republican nomination .	gingrich has acknowledged that the onslaught of attacks on him has taken a toll and tested his pledge to keep his criticism focused on democratic president barack obama .	aides for several campaigns competing against gingrich as well as outside independent groups aligned with the rival candidates say their internal polls find that he has fallen over the last week from the top slot in iowa .	and a national gallup poll released monday found gingrich 's support plummeting : he had the backing of 26 percent of republican voters nationally , down from 37 percent on dec. 8 .	romney 's support was largely unchanged at 24 percent .	gingrich rushed back to iowa on monday after a three-day absence for several days of campaigning before voters tune out this weekend for the christmas holiday .	he told about 200 people in the garage of a security company in davenport that he would launch a 44-stop jobs and prosperity tour before the caucuses , and use those events to answer any charges put out there .	gingrich 's weakened position follows a barrage of advertising that cast him as a longtime washington power-broker .	the ads , primarily financed by so-called super political action committees , underscore the power of independent groups following a supreme court decision last year that allowed individuals , unions and corporations to donate unlimited amounts of money to outfits advocating the election or defeat of political candidates .	since the ruling , groups have popped up to work on behalf of every serious republican presidential candidate .	gingrich has redoubled his appeals to conservatives , who make up the base of the republican party , with sharp criticism of the judiciary , saying he would have the justice department instruct the u.s. marshal service to arrest judges who ignore subpoenas to testify in congress about their decisions .	romney joined those criticizing gingrich 's comments on judges , telling fox news in an interview monday that gingrich 's idea of sending authorities after judges was neither constitutional nor practical . "	let me tell you , there are a lot of decisions by judges i vehemently disagree with , " romney said . "	the solution to judges out of control is not to tear up the constitution and say that the congress of the united states becomes the now ultimate power in this country .	... in the constitution , there is a method for removing a justice .	there 's also a method for reversing their decisions . "	meanwhile , an anonymous independent group calling itself iowans for christian leadership is urging conservatives not to back gingrich , in light of his two divorces and past marital infidelity .	the group has issued fliers and posted a scathing online video aimed at gingrich .	as gingrich tried to answer the criticism , romney , his chief rival , was largely laying low , increasingly expressing optimism as he revels in a series of endorsements from establishment party figures such as bob dole , the 1996 republican presidential nominee , early-voting state leaders like south carolina gov. nikki haley , and newspapers including the des moines register of iowa .

how many louisiana residents are " wealthy " is among the latest disputes in a fight over a u.s. senate seat .	republican incumbent david vitter is supporting an extension of all bush-era tax cuts and slamming his democratic challenger , rep. charlie melancon , for backing extension of only those cuts aimed at individuals making less than $ 200,000 annually and households bringing in less than $ 250,000 a year .	melancon 's position matches that of president barack obama .	vitter 's campaign notes that even some of melancon 's fellow " blue dogs " ?	fiscally conservative democrats ?	have broken with the president and favor extending all of the cuts .	louisiana democrats , in a state where average per-person income is $ 35,000 , have seized on a comment vitter made at a recent forum sponsored by the chamber of commerce in crowley .	saying it was a mistake to raise any taxes in tough economic times , vitter said , " i hate to tell you , by washington 's definition that he 's ( melancon ) using , virtually everybody in this audience is ' the wealthy , ' so hold on to your wallets . " "	his answer to the question about raising taxes was regarding small businesses , e.g. it was at a crowley chamber of commerce , hence the small business audience reference , " vitter campaign spokesman luke bolar said in an e-mailed response to questions friday .	asked if democrats were stretching the point of vitter 's remarks , melancon campaign spokesman jeff giertz insisted not . "	if vitter thinks that nearly everyone in an audience in crowley , louisiana ?	especially an audience of small business owners ?	makes more than $ 250,000 per year , then he really has no clue when it comes to the struggles louisiana families are going through , " giertz said in an e-mail .

the first soup kitchen in boone county will open later this year thanks to an anonymous donor .	the kentucky enquirer ( http://cin.ci/ltkxfz ) reports the mary rose mission was able to hire a construction company in june after getting the $ 150,000 contribution .	that means after more than a year of delays in the project , crews are working on the facility full time and expect to finish in september .	the facility had been dependent on the uncertain schedules of volunteers to finish the project .

" "	we are an islamic establishment and the dress code is a reflection of our conservative muslim traditions and values , " she said .	salameh says she had worked for jordan 's industrial development bank for 25 years until it was acquired in 2010 by the jordan dubai islamic bank ?	an offshoot of the dubai islamic bank based in the united arab emirates .	in january 2011 , the new management issued a new regulation stipulating a unified dress code for its workers , including waist-to-heel skirts and head covers for female employees .	salameh accepted the uniform , but refused to wear the head cover on grounds that it violated her religious beliefs and since the contract she signed when she was hired did not oblige her to a dress code .	affaneh , the spokeswoman , said the headcover " is a fashionable piece of white cloth that shows the hair line ?	like what women wear in the gulf arab countries . " "	it 's not a headscarf , covering all the hair , " she added .	she and salameh said that five other christian women employees at the bank accepted wearing the headcover .	when salameh refused the head cover , " no action was taken against me for nearly 17 months until two weeks ago , when i was suddenly given two notices , five days apart , warning me that i will lose my job if i do n't wear the head cover , " she said . "	when i stuck by my decision , i was verbally fired last sunday , " she said , adding that she filed a lawsuit against the bank .	the next legal step would be for the court to decide when it would hear the case .	affaneh , the spokeswoman , says the bank has not been notified of the lawsuit . "	her contract allows her to do what she wants , " she said .	she declined to discuss the matter further .
the united states has imposed sanctions against a state-owned energy company in belarus for a $ 500 million investment with an iranian firm accused of contributing to iran 's suspect nuclear program .	the state department said tuesday it has hit belarusneft with penalties that cut its access to u.s. markets over a 2007 contract it signed with naftiran intertrade company to develop iran 's jofeir oilfield .	the penalties include a ban on u.s. export licenses , loans and government contracts .	the sanctions were imposed under the u.s. laws that seek to punish iran for failing to prove its nuclear program is peaceful by penalizing foreign businesses that invest in its energy sector .	the u.s. says such investments help support the iranian nuclear program that it believes is a cover for developing atomic weapons .
deckhand donald pitts stood at the stern of the coho king charter boat with his hands dangling at his sides looking a bit like a gunslinger .	from his vantage point , pitts could see the fishing rods on both sides of the 42-foot boat .	a rod on the starboard side lunged toward the water .	pitts grabbed the long-handled landing net and charged forward . "	keep it coming , " he said , coaching the angler .	the net swooped into the gray waters of the pacific ocean and out came a coho salmon .	the whole episode from bite to landing lasted 60 seconds , maybe . "	you got to be right on them on those front rods , " pitts said , explaining a noteworthy nuance of fishing with barbless hooks .	the coho ?	a fin-clipped , hatchery-origin keeper ?	flops on the deck as pitts clips on another pre-tied anchovy and hoochie and immediately gets the bait back into the ocean .	he puts a mark on the snout of the salmon , flips it in the fish box and waits ?	repeating the sequence again and again during the next three hours .	it is the essence of salmon charter angling ?	patience interrupted with frenetic periods of catching fish , often multiple fish .	by 8:25 a.m. , the coho king has 15 coho and one chinook and captain-owner butch smith heads east toward the port of ilwaco boat basin . "	salmon in the ocean are a chewing fish , not a striking fish yet , " smith said . "	it 's just like a hamburger and they 'll take a bite out of it . "	this is smith 's 40th year as either a deckhand or skipper on the ocean at the mouth of the columbia river .	he was here when the port was jammed with boats in the 1970s , compared to the much smaller number of charters and private boats now .	coho fishing has been good this season , with most days a limit caught and the boat back to the dock by 10 a.m. or so .	smith said he expects to see it get better in august . "	the difference between good and better is being done by 10 or 11 a.m. when it 's good and 8 a.m. when it 's better , " he said .	government biologists are forecasting a run of more than 964,000 coho in the ocean this summer destined for the columbia river .	smith said his experience this season leads him to believe the coho run will be all of that ?	or slightly larger .	by comparison , the coho return to the columbia river has averaged 293,000 during the past three years .	the much-awaited buoy 10 season opens aug. 1 .	buoy 10 is the name given to the lower 16 miles of the columbia between buoy no. 10 at the river mouth upstream to tongue point , east of astoria .	sportsmen with boats as small as 16 feet can fish at buoy 10 most days , launching from ramps at ilwaco , chinook , cape disappointment , astoria , hammond , warrenton , john day and deep river .	smith said his business does n't dwindle due to buoy 10 opening . "	when buoy 10 is slow , there 's not really another place to go , " smith said . "	some people want that ocean experience and we can go 20 miles either direction from the mouth of the river to look for fish . "	he has trips booked into september . "	september is a mystery month .	some years it 's great and some years about sept. 15 it dies a quick death . "	the closure of sturgeon retention in the columbia river estuary this year hurt the coastal economy , said smith , also a port of ilwaco commissioner .	he offered catch-and-release sturgeon trips and believes the population is rebounding well .	to diversify his business , smith plans to offer $ 80-a-day trips for crab in the fall .	danny and katrina pitts of kelso ?	no relation to the deckhand ?	took their three granddaughters ocean fishing and went home with 10 coho . "	all in all , a pretty good day , " said pitts , a former counselor at larch corrections center in east clark county .	trip tips season : waters off the northern oregon and southern washington coast are open daily for salmon fishing through sept. 30 .	the limit is two daily .	any chinook may be retained but only fin-clipped coho .	only one chinook per day is allowed in the limit .	website : links to five ocean charter operators at ilwaco can be found online at ilwacofishingcharters.com .
when earl liston and jan northrop volunteered to work a book sale at the donald w. reynolds library last year , they never thought their chance meeting would blossom into a friendship ?	much less a romance .	both were members of friends of the library but had never met until the book sale .	it did n't take long before they were discussing books and discovered they enjoyed many of the same subjects and authors . "	as the books came through , i 'd hold up a book and ask , ' have you ever read this ? ' "	said northrop , 73 . "	during the four-hour shift , we talked the whole time .	when it was time to go , we were still talking . "	when it was time to leave , liston , 74 , asked for her phone number .	a couple of weeks later , they went to lunch .	now , a year later , the two are planning a wedding . "	we 're just two people who bumped into each other and enjoyed each other 's company , and away we went , " liston said , grinning .	neither were seeking romance when they joined friends of the library .	in fact , northrop 's first thought when she was paired with liston at the book sale was , " ' oh no , i have to work with a man and he wo n't talk , ' " northrop said , laughing .	but liston did talk , and also offered to run the adding machine for her . "	i liked him right away , " she said .	liston 's first thought ?	besides being struck with her beauty ?	was that he had met an extremely nice person . "	i thought , ' wow , i 've really met someone very nice , ' " he said .	their first date turned out to be prophetic , although slightly embarrassing .	they met for brunch at the restaurant at gaston 's white river resort , and an employee checked in with them to see if they saved room for dessert .	northrop told him , " i always save room for dessert , " and the employee told liston , " she 's a wise woman .	you should marry her . "	since their first date , they still have n't run out of things to talk about .	they discuss current events and enjoy talking about childhood memories , such as watching the television show " captain video " or tuning in to the " let 's pretend " radio show on saturday mornings .	both make volunteering a priority .	liston is active with the mountain home dog park committee and northrop has volunteered with the humane society of north central arkansas and the twin lakes literacy council . "	there is n't any better place to meet someone because right away when you have those similarities it gives you a great base for friendships , " northrop said . "	it 's a good way to get acquainted with people .	you 're meeting the kind of people you want to know . "	the couple became engaged in december and are planning an april 28 wedding at their new home . "	knowing jan really makes me happier , " liston said . "	it 's just a very happy time .	maybe that 's what makes it so fun ?	we were n't looking to meet . "	on the one-year anniversary of the day they met , the two will be volunteering at the friends of the library used book sale .

local election officials in connecticut are being told they can ask people wearing world wrestling entertainment garb to cover it up while voting because it could be considered political advertising for republican senate candidate linda mcmahon , the company 's former ceo .	state election law prevents political advertising within 75 feet of the polls .	av harris , spokesman for the secretary of state 's office , said the state 's advice does n't mean that voters wearing wwe apparel will not be allowed to vote .

"	it is a deadly force encounter , " bonner said . "	one that justifies the use of deadly force . "	the violence in mexico combined with assaults against border patrol agents in the u.s. has increased the level of apprehension agents have about their safety , bonner said .	less than two weeks ago , mexican migrant anastacio hernandez , 32 , died after a customs and border protection officer shocked him with a stun gun at the san ysidro border crossing that separates san diego and tijuana , mexico .	last week the san diego medical examiner 's office ruled that death a homicide .

ah , but it 's the quality of the ingredients that matters , that chef will probably say .	and so it is with stephen frears ' " philomena , " a film whose cinematic recipe seems tricky at best : take a shocking and tragic tale ?	a true one , involving the catholic church , no less ?	and make it into a film that 's part serious drama , part jaunty road-buddy movie , and part comedy .	such an unwieldy mix flirts with danger , even tastelessness , but " philomena " works , thanks to the quality of its ingredients ?	especially the sensitive and nuanced performances by the ever-superb judi dench and by steve coogan , who also co-wrote the script .	director frears , carefully calibrating the tone here , is in fine form as he tackles a story based on the 2009 investigative book " the lost son of philomena lee , " by martin sixsmith .	lee , still living today , is an irish woman who , as a teenager , became pregnant during a fairground tryst , not even understanding the biology of such things .	rejected at home , she was sent to a convent where she endured a painful birth ?	and told the pain was penance for her sin ?	then forced to work in the laundry with other " fallen women " for years in virtual imprisonment , allowed to see her son for one hour a day .	worse yet , the convent sold babies to wealthy americans , and philomena 's son , anthony , was carried off one day as a toddler , without so much as a goodbye to his mother .	the movie begins on anthony 's 50th birthday , with philomena still desperate to find out what happened to him .	her adult daughter has a chance meeting with the former bbc journalist sixsmith , who 's just lost his government job amid scandal , and is in need of work .	at first , sixsmith , rather an oxford snob , dismisses the tale as a " human interest " story .	but soon , martin and philomena are heading to washington , where they make one astonishing discovery after another .	and they discover things about each other , too .	philomena , it turns out , is chatty , cheerful and fond of romance novels .	martin is rather abrupt and snooty , and wants his " quiet time . "	will these opposites find common ground ?	uh , have you ever seen a road movie ?	but there 's more happening here , thankfully .	philomena , despite her devastating treatment by the catholic church , remains deeply religious and slow to blame the nuns who mistreated her .	martin is cynical about religion , and eager to achieve vindication for philomena .	but is that really what she wants ?	and along with its religious , moral and character issues , the film also explores , more subtly , questions of journalistic ethics .	the pair 's trip to washington is paid for by a tabloid keenly interested in the lurid aspects of the tale .	but what about philomena 's privacy ?	martin is helping her , of course , but is he exploiting her , too , for a story ?	we would n't care about any of this if the performances were weak .	but both actors find complexity and depth .	dench is not known for playing weak characters ?	m , from the bond movies ?	various british queens ? ?	but she finds a way to imbue a simple , uneducated character with an inner strength and dignity .	also notable : the touching sophie kennedy clark as young philomena .	cinematography by robbie ryan and editing by valerio bonelli contribute to a wonderfully natural feel to the frequent flashbacks and grainy home films .	and it 's a happy development that producers won their appeal to have this film , despite an occasional salty word , designated pg-13 rather than r .	that means a broader audience will see it .	people , as philomena herself says in the film , should know what happened . "	philomena , " a weinstein company release , is rated pg-13 by the motion picture association of america for " some strong language , thematic elements and sexual references . "	running time : 98 minutes .	three and a half stars out of four .

in a rare freshman power play , 16 house republican newcomers pledged wednesday to support gov. c.l. " butch " otter 's proposal for a state-designed insurance exchange ?	provided it 's coupled with protections giving the idaho legislature more oversight over how it 's set up and operated .	otter 's plan to build a state-based , nonprofit marketplace to offer insurance to individuals and small businesses , required under president obama 's health care overhaul come 2014 , is awaiting full senate debate .	on wednesday morning , the house group that includes most of the chamber 's 23 gop freshman said they 'd support that measure if it includes provisions forbidding idaho from using state taxpayer money to fund it , add two non-voting legislators to an 18-member exchange board of directors and require the board meet openly , so the public can monitor its decisions .	debate over an idaho-based exchange has been politically charged , with many residents who attended a senate hearing last week angrily urging lawmakers to reject it , on grounds it was acquiescing to washington pressure . "	i was n't looking for cover , " said rep. robert anderst , r-nampa and a member of the freshman group , on why he joined amid the tense rhetoric . "	i was looking for the best way forward .	individually , we have little to no influence .	but as a group , if there are things we can do to help in this effort , let 's stand together . "	otter indicated he supports the group 's push . "	the house had concerns ?	we 're just addressing those concerns , " said tammy perkins , one of the republican governor 's aides . "	this is just going to make them more confident with the legislation , and we 're fine with that . "	senate president pro tem brent hill , r-rexburg , also offered tentative support . "	i have n't read the bill , but i 've talked to them about it in concept , " hill told the associated press . "	as near as i can tell , they 're good additions . "	rep. luke malek , r-coeur d'alene and another leader of the freshman group , said its members still oppose obama 's 2010 law , but believe an exchange is inevitable after passing u.s. supreme court muster in 2012 .	rather than adopting a federal exchange , as about 25 other republican-led states are have opted to do , malek argued the best path for idaho is to design a state-specific version coupled with strong governance rules . "	we have introduced legislation in the insurance exchange battle that protects individual rights , defends state sovereignty and gives idaho what we believe to be the best option for dealing with the realities of obamacare , " malek said .	the group 's bill won introduction wednesday in the house health and welfare committee .	just a single member ?	house majority caucus chairman john vander woude , of nampa ?	opposed its introduction . "	i 'm against a state exchange , " vander woude said afterward . "	why would i vote for something that helps create it ? "	wayne hoffman , leader of the idaho freedom foundation and fierce state exchange opponent , was also disappointed that so many gop freshman were behind the bill ?	a development that suggests there are now plenty of house votes for otter 's plan .	to pass , the exchange bill and the freshman group 's companion measure need at least 36 votes .	one of the 16 freshmen , rep. kelley packer , of mccammon , said she 's been threatened by some that her political career would be in jeopardy in the 2014 election , if she backed a state exchange .	she did n't say who .	that 's a risk packer said she 's willing to take , provided the appropriate sideboards are in place . "	simply doing nothing is irresponsible , " she said .

the republican primary battle for a u.s. senate seat in texas has already been nasty and expensive ?	and now it 's just getting started .	establishment gop favorite and lt. gov. david dewhurst beat tea party darling and former state solicitor general ted cruz by 10 percentage points tuesday , but fell well short of breaking the 50 percent margin of votes cast needed to avoid a runoff .	the pair emerged from a nine-candidate republican field and will square off in a second round of voting july 31 .	that means nine more weeks of a race drawing national attention because a victory by cruz may mirror an upset similar to richard mourdock 's ousting of 36-year senate veteran richard lugar in indiana .	on the democratic side , no candidate in a field of four won a majority , setting up a runoff between former state rep. paul sadler and perennial candidate grady yarbrough of san antonio , who does not even have a campaign website .	texas has n't elected a democrat to the u.s. senate since lloyd bentsen in 1988 , so the winner of the republican primary should easily prevail in november 's general election .	the millionaire owner of energy consortiums , dewhurst won the endorsement of gov. rick perry and poured $ 15 million of his own money into his campaign .	cruz , a fiery attorney , spent just $ 470,000 from his personal funds , but got millions in support from national grassroots groups , including the washington-based , anti-tax club for growth .	cruz also was endorsed by former alaska gov. sarah palin and south carolina sen. jim demint , who called the runoff , " a major victory for the conservative movement . " "	ted cruz was virtually unknown when this race began , and he was drastically outspent by his multimillionaire opponent , " demint said in a statement wednesday .	the republican fight has already been a vicious one , with cruz branding dewhurst as a moderate willing to compromise on key issues and dewhurst attacking his opponent for his law firm 's representing of a chinese tire manufacturer in an intellectual property dispute with an american company , and implying that cruz supports amnesty for illegal immigrants .	more mudslinging will surely be on the way . "	the voters of texas want a leader who will be a strong conservative and a fighter , and the lieutenant governor 's record has not been conservative , " cruz told the associated press , after celebrating tuesday 's results with a group of raucous supporters in houston . "	he has consistently compromised with democrats , increased spending and increased taxes , " cruz said . "	despite a mountain of money trying to paint a very different picture , the voters of texas held him accountable . "	dewhurst held his own party in houston , but the scene was more subdued .	he decried the outside groups supporting cruz for attempting to meddle in texas politics . "	tonight , is a clear message to washington special interests : do n't mess with texas .	texans want to elect their own united states senator , " dewhurst said . "	today , republican voters made a choice between a conservative texas businessman and washington special interests . "	cruz brushed off criticism he was too reliant on out-of-state backers . "	i am honored to have earned the support from conservatives all over the country , " he said . "	this has been a victory for conservatives throughout texas and nationally because the senate is a national battleground . "	but dewhurst maintains that his record overseeing the texas senate during nearly nine years as lieutenant governor speaks for itself , and points out that he is a key reason texas has become one of the most conservative states in the country .	he also said , however that he was proud of occasionally compromising to ensure key legislation moved forward . "	the word moderate was meant to be a negative on me .	i 'm a proud conservative , " dewhurst said . "	at the same time , i will work to move what is in the best interests of the state of texas as i always have over the last nine years . "

state and local officials promised an egyptian company $ 200 million in tax breaks to build a fertilizer plant in iowa without knowledge of a pending lawsuit alleging one of the company 's subsidiaries defrauded u.s. taxpayers out of millions of dollars , officials told the associated press .	the iowa economic development authority and lee county approved the incentives for a subsidiary of cairo-based orascom construction industries , which is planning to invest $ 1.4 billion to build the plant near burlington .	their failure to uncover the lawsuit ?	disclosed by orascom in its annual report ?	raises questions about the research that went into the deal , which has been criticized as rushed and overly generous .	orascom did n't tell iowa officials ?	and were not required to ?	that it is contesting a lawsuit filed by the federal government in 2004 alleging its subsidiary , virginia-based contrack international , was part of a joint venture that improperly won $ 332 million in u.s.-financed construction contracts in egypt , officials said .	the state 's vetting also did not uncover the lawsuit , which seeks to recover funds spent by the u.s. agency for international development , authority director debi durham told the ap . "	it did not come up in our due diligence , " she said . "	but you 're talking about a global corporation that has numerous subsidiaries .	i 'm not sure how anyone would have found that . "	orascom had disclosed the lawsuit previously , saying it owns 40 percent of a venture being sued by the united states , according to copies of its annual reports reviewed by ap .	orascom says it has " strong substantive reasons " to deny the allegations , and that any resolution should n't significantly impact its financial statements .	the lawsuit alleges contrack and two other companies collaborated to win usaid-financed contracts to build egyptian infrastructure for which they should have been ineligible .	they formed a secret , joint venture to conceal that one of the partners was an egyptian company , the lawsuit alleges , because only u.s. contractors were eligible .	sawiris , the orascom ceo who recently appeared with branstad at the plant 's groundbreaking , was designated as contrack 's representative on the venture 's executive committee , records show .	he has not been personally accused of wrongdoing .	some employees working on the iowa project are employed by contrack .	durham said orascom 's performance would be closely monitored , noting iowa could revoke incentives if it fails to build the plant or hire workers as promised .	she said she did n't consider the federal allegations important and critics were " pulling at straws " if they claim otherwise .	the plant would employ 165 workers and support more than 2,000 temporary construction jobs , backers say .	critics say the subsidies were too generous per job and wondered whether the project would 've come to iowa without them .	orascom created a subsidiary in delaware called the iowa fertilizer company before applying for incentives .	in its application , orascom strategic planning director kevin struve attested that the iowa fertilizer company had not broken any laws .	branstad 's administration promised tax credits worth more than $ 100 million as well as a $ 1.6 million loan .	a state transportation commission agreed tuesday to spend $ 5 million on improving the roads around the plant .	lee county waived the plant 's property taxes for 20 years in lieu of payments totaling $ 16.5 million ?	an estimated $ 130 million break .	in addition , orascom is borrowing $ 1.2 billion from a bond program created by congress in 2008 to help the u.s. midwest recover from floods and tornadoes ?	a subsidy that could shave $ 300 million off interest payments , said sen. joe bolkcom , an iowa city democrat . "	this company is pushing , pushing , pushing and they have taken taxpayers to the cleaners , " he said .	bolkcom said state officials conducted an " amateur hour " negotiation with orascom , and should look into the lawsuit 's allegations .	the government 's lawsuit alleges that contrack joined with idaho-based morrison knudsen corp. and an egyptian company to bid starting in 1997 on work to construct water and wastewater infrastructure in egyptian cities .	contrack and morrison knudsen told usaid they were the only team members , and kept the egyptian company 's involvement secret , the lawsuit alleges , submitting invoices that falsely attested all companies involved met the u.s. nationality requirements .	usaid 's inspector general uncovered the suspected fraud in 2002 .	the lawsuit alleges they violated the false claims act and were unjustly enriched .	associated press investigative researcher randy herschaft contributed to this report .

saab automobile filed for bankruptcy on monday , giving up a desperate struggle to stay in business after previous owner general motors co. blocked takeover attempts by chinese investors .	saab ceo victor muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a court in southwestern sweden , ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded sedans and quirky design features .	the dutch entrepreneur told reporters he had to pull the plug after gm , which still owns some technology licenses for saab , rejected a last-ditch financing plan involving a chinese company . "	that basically was the last nail in the coffin of this beautiful company , " muller said in webcast news conference at the saab plant in trollhattan , southwestern sweden .	the vanersborg district court was expected to approve the application later monday . "	this is the most unwelcome christmas gift i could have imagined , " said fredrik almqvist , 36 , who has worked at saab 's assembly line for nearly 17 years .	while experts say the company is likely to be chopped up and sold in parts , local officials in the town of trollhattan , where saab employs more than 3,000 people , were holding out hope that a new buyer would emerge to salvage the brand . "	our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its entirety , " trollhattan mayor paul akerlund said in a statement .	muller used his luxury sports car maker spyker cars to buy saab from gm in 2010 , promising to restore its swedish identity , but the company ran out of money just a year later .	even as production stopped and salary payments were delayed , muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company 's real estate and lining up financing deals with investors in russia and china .	he bought time by placing the company in a reconstruction process under bankruptcy protection .	but the deals fell through , blocked by regulators or by gm , which was concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of chinese competitors .	the final chinese suitor , zhejiang youngman lotus automobile co. , said it pulled out after the last proposal for a solution was rejected by gm over the weekend . "	we were supporting them to the last moment , even up to 1 a.m. this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone , but due to gm 's position , in the end sweden 's saab filed for bankruptcy this morning , " said rachel pang , an executive director of a subsidiary company of youngman and daughter of youngman 's founder , pang qingnian .	muller blamed the former administrator of saab 's reconstruction , guy lofalk , for the collapse of the talks , saying lofalk had led the chinese investors to believe they could become sole owners of the company .	muller said he knew that was impossible given gm 's concerns about licenses . "	until this problem arose the relationship with gm was excellent , " muller said .	calls to lofalk 's office were not answered monday .	swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert peter smedman said the prospects of selling saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend on gm . "	the licenses that gm has are crucial for the value of the company , " smedman said .

tom treesh welcomes visitors to his creation like a proud papa .	maybe it was fond memories of hundreds of hours spent sailing the chesapeake bay that made him do it .	or maybe it was insanity , treesh jokes .	for 20 years , he 's been transforming his family 's former chic 's beach summer home into a boat .	there are portholes , refurbished fish-fighting chairs , masts , decking and propellers .	most impressive , the bow of a yacht treesh salvaged from a norfolk shipyard sits atop what was once a carport .	underneath is his " man cave . "	standing on the stern of that yacht , which serves as a porch , treesh extended a skinny arm . "	welcome to chic 's beach marina , " he said .	then his voice took a somber tone . "	at least for a little while longer , " he said .	the city has started to crack down on treesh after years of what senior zoning inspector kevin herschberger called a " flowing problem . "	in april , treesh was issued a court summons .	in an april 22 letter , the city said it had received numerous complaints about construction on his property and that he has n't obtained required permits .	treesh has taken a fatalistic approach to the news . "	everything 's got ta go , " he said .	an hour after a city visit recently , treesh said , he was in tears . "	and i 'm a grown man . "	his girlfriend jerrie delozier is more optimistic .	delozier calls treesh " the artistic one " and herself " the logical one . "	she acknowledged that some pieces of the boat house , as it is known in the neighborhood , will have to go .	but she 's hoping she can get the summons stayed , and in the meantime obtain a survey of the property , and apply for a variance for the carport/yacht stern . "	we really would like to keep the boat , " delozier said . "	that 's his heart , it really is . "	treesh began living in the house which his grandfather built after attending graduate school in the 1960s .	but the transformation did n't start until the 1990s .	that 's when the former special education teacher and instructor at the virginia beach jail used connections at shipyards to keep him abreast of dismantled boats , and picked up nautical knickknacks at marine auctions .	since then , his home has become something of a landmark .	treesh said former mayors have visited and tourists make stops .	a sailing club in norfolk gave him extra masts , and he routinely awakens in the morning to find gifts rope , propellers , old boat chairs outside his door .	he kept a quick pace on a tour , gesturing to a tin sign he said harkened from the ash wednesday storm of 1962 , and stopping to admire dark-stained wood support beams . "	solid mahogany , " he said . "	are n't they beautiful ? "	delozier has told him " no more stuff . " ''	he never finishes anything , " she said .	she and treesh met in third grade at ocean view elementary school .	back then , he was shy , she said .	they did n't reconnect until she moved to chic 's beach in the late 1970s .	while at the grocery store one day , she recognized a guy with " a mr. clean haircut . "	treesh walked up and said , " i think i know you . " "	then all of a sudden it dawned on me , " delozier said . "	i told him , ' i knew you when you had hair . ' "	they started dating about 10 years ago .	treesh calls her his mermaid .	treesh can think of a million things more he could do .	he 's got two oars he wants to mount , crossed , on the ceiling .	delozier is not on board . "	do n't put anything else on the ceiling , tom , " she said .	treesh kept his gaze upward .	then he glanced around the room , his eyes stopping on his favorite white canvas fighting chair and a table he made from a mast .

about 70,000 washington residents who have limited english may lose access to interpreters during medical visits under a proposed budget cut .	the spending cut proposed by gov. chris gregoire would eliminate a state-financed program that subsidizes interpreter services to medical clinics and hospitals who serve medicaid patients .	at about $ 2 million , the proposed cut is a moderate one out of the governor 's emergency budget reductions , but one of the dozens needed as gregoire and legislators grapple with a state budget that keeps falling in deeper deficits .	lawmakers met in a special session saturday to approve steps for trimming a $ 1.1 billion budget deficit through june .	another , larger deficit in the next two-year budget also awaits when lawmakers return for regular meetings in january .	the interpreter program is conducted by the department of social and health services , which had been ordered to cut $ 113 million from its spending , spokesman jim stevenson said .	under federal law , health care providers are required to make sure their medicaid patients are able to communicate their needs well and for years the state felt it was n't fair to let providers carry that burden , stevenson said .	so the state created the interpreter program , in which the state pays for the interpretation services .	stevenson said washington is one of 13 states to have such a program .	cutting the program would shift the cost of hiring interpreters to doctors , hospitals and clinics , or it will be another reason for health care providers to stop serving medicaid patients , representatives for medical and interpreters services aid . "	no one here has argued it 's a good idea , but it 's the only way to get that big chunk of dollars ( from the budget ) , " stevenson said .	the impact warning from the budget writers says that cutting the program may result in " family members , including children , or other unqualified individuals " being used to relay complex medical information to patients .	poor communication is a risk , the dshs budget writers said , as well as an increase of emergency room visits due to lack of health care providers .	while the cut of state money is about $ 2 million , the annual budget for the program is around $ 14 million .	because it 's a medicaid program , the federal government matches 65 percent of what the state contributes .	the cut was originally set to be implemented next month , but after heavy lobbying , that date has been pushed back to march , giving lawmakers time to reconsider .	last year , the governor 's office also ordered dshs to also draw up plans for alternatives to cutting the program .	those alternatives included transforming interpreters to state employees instead of contractors eliminating costs of going through a broker company .	other cost reducing ideas include remote video-linked and phone interpretation , said todd slettvet , who supervises the interpreter program for the state .	but the program is one of the easier ones to cut .	interpretation is an optional matching program under medicaid and most optional programs are on the chopping block , slettvet said .	the state draws from 1,500 interpreters who are contracted by a third-party broker .	there are around 166 languages spoken in the state , but interpreters are mainly used for eight , which include russian and spanish , slettvet said .	many interpreters around the state have formed a union under the washington federation of state employees .	the union helped lobby for the delay in implementation and has pushed to make interpreters state employees .	tim welch , a union organizer , said the state could face civil rights lawsuits if the program is eliminated .	lack of correct communication , welch said , could also mean mistakes could be made by doctors , putting them at risk of litigation as well .	welch said that the state would be giving up millions of federal dollars by cutting this program .	at the south lake clinic in renton , russian , ukrainian and spanish-speaking people often visit the clinic .	after learning of the proposed cut , ceo don robertson said his clinics are considering fully withdrawing from dshs programs . "	i think a lot of physicians will stop seeing patients that are covered under the program .	for us , we 're going to discuss that here , " robertson said .	the program " is absolutely crucial , everything from a patient understanding a treatment program to medications .	they have to understand what the diagnosis is and what is necessary to treat the conditions . "	narscisa hodges , a 44-year-old interpreter from panama , said her job goes beyond translating languages .	she sees herself as a cultural bridge between doctors and foreign-born patients .	without proper interpretation , hodges says patients may be reluctant to provide vital information and doctors may assume incorrect information . "	assumptions are not good in the medical field , " hodges said .	in the medical field , " little things make a difference because if the doctor says to take four pills twice a day , that 's not the same as taking two pills twice a day .

alma is a picturesque village on the banks of the mississippi river not far from la crosse .	its modest downtown is backed by steep bluffs on one side and its foundations brushed by the river on the other .	it could be any wisconsin river town .	but for a brief while in the early 1900s , alma became notorious as the centerpiece for the misguided and now-discredited campaign to better society through eugenics , or the improvement of the human race by encouraging so-called desirable genetic traits .	research by a university of new hampshire psychology professor has brought to light an odd and unsettling article in which a well-known scientist of the time labeled nearly a quarter of alma 's residents " hereditary defectives . "	the new research , published by benjamin harris , who is also an affiliate professor of history , brings alive the disturbing time in american history when some of the country 's most progressive thinkers ?	including highly-respected political and educational leaders in wisconsin ?	were calling for such drastic measures as sterilization of those they considered to be mentally lacking .	in the fall of 1913 in what is now a mostly forgotten piece in the american magazine titled " the village of a thousand souls , " famed child psychologist arnold gesell , who was himself from alma , published what harris found was a flawed and manipulated study in which he claimed about a quarter of the village 's thousand residents showed " the taint of either insanity or feeblemindedness . "	in the article , of which current residents seem almost entirely unaware , gesell went on to suggest " a course of supervision and segregation which will prevent the horrible renewal of this defective protoplasm that is contaminating the stream of village life . "	harris , whose study of gesell 's article is published in the most recent issue of the journal " history of psychology , " has long had an interest in gesell and his relationship to the pseudo-science of eugenics .	especially after coming across " the village of a thousand souls , " he was puzzled by gesell 's apparent embrace of eugenic thought , mainly because gesell is today still thought of as one of the most influential of child psychologists but also because of his reputation as a socialist and progressive .	the more harris dug into gesell 's authorship of the american magazine article and into its historical context , the more he learned about the surprising extent to which social reformers early in the 20th century espoused eugenics as a means of viewing and addressing society 's ills .	harris found that gesell even chose photographs that accompanied his article to better fit his eugenics-based theory that the village was degenerate .	for example , gesell , drawing on photos from his father 's alma photo studio , chose a less-than-flattering photo of an early settler of alma that had been taken years before .	it showed the man , abraham schmocker , in front of what appeared to be a dilapidated shack with rags stuffed in broken windows .	harris , however , found other photos of schmocker in which the shack is more accurately shown to be a tidy log cabin and schmocker is portrayed in a much more sympathetic light .	even so , in his article , gesell labeled the photo of schmocker " evidence of a feeble mind . "	gesell also used a photo that shows residents gathered on the street beneath a tavern with a sign above that reads " saloon . "	because he believed that alcoholism was linked to feeblemindedness , harris said , gesell wanted to show a saloon in alma and labeled the photo " main street of the village of thousand souls . "	but harris discovered that the photo was n't even taken in alma ; it was from reads landing , minn. .	gesell went so far as to draw a map of the village 's homes along with a key that identified in various houses the number of people he labeled " feeble-minded " ?	information gleaned at least in part , harris said , by gossip from gesell 's mother .	also identified in various homes are those gesell labeled insane , alcoholic , epileptic , suicidal , criminal , eccentric and tubercular . "	and so we might continue on our journey through the village , " gesell wrote , " going from house to house as the local assessor does on his yearly rounds , but not to appraise the material goods and lands ; rather to evaluate the grade and quality of the human ' stock . ' "	as might be expected , gesell 's article was not well-received in alma , though little remains of any specific responses to the piece .	harris placed an advertisement in the local newspaper searching for anyone with information about reaction to the article but got little response .	he did hear from two women whose families were in alma at the time .	both reported that people were apparently more ashamed than angry .	they also recalled incidents that might have prompted gesell to choose his hometown as the subject of the study , such as the time a woman whose husband was having an affair doused herself in kerosene , lit herself on fire , and ran down the middle of the street .	how , harris wondered , did someone such as gesell become so enamored of eugenics that he would actually manipulate research ?	harris said it is important to place gesell in the context of the times .	social scientists were as much crusaders for the improvement of the human lot as they were researchers .	and gesell was a respected scientist .	he received a graduate degree from uw-madison where he studied under frederick jackson turner and a ph.d. in child psychology from clark university .	later , he earned a medical degree from yale and worked there as a professor and researcher doing groundbreaking work , becoming a world authority on child development .	marcy guddemi is executive director of the gesell institute of child development , which bases its work on gesell 's later groundbreaking research .	she said she was disappointed that the press release explaining harris ' study focused on the photos rather than on the context of gesell 's early thought and political beliefs .	gesell 's foray into eugenics , harris found , has to do with the desire of such progressives in the late 19th and early 20th century to engineer a better society .	gesell 's article , harris said , reflects " a time in which genetic and environmental reforms seemed complimentary rather than in opposition . "	harris said the wisconsin state legislature passed a bill in the early 1900s that allowed sterilization of the so-called mentally unfit .	and even a university of wisconsin luminary such as charles van hise , as president of the university , gave lectures in which he supported eugenics as a way to conserve human resources .	he said that " as a first very moderate step toward the development of the stamina of the human race , defectives should be precluded from continuing the race by some proper method . "	gesell 's article on alma assumed national importance in light of the enthusiasm for eugenics , harris said .	it was reproduced in a booklet used by ministers to prepare their sermons and became the subject of many a sunday morning address from pulpits across the nation .	but by 1930 , harris said , the wave of enthusiasm for eugenics had run its course , at least in the u.s. and even gesell , over the remaining years of his career , largely abandoned his support of eugenics and tempered his belief in the influence of heredity with greater emphasis on the role of environment in a child 's upbringing .	alma , meanwhile , survived its brush with notoriety and today , with a population of something less than a thousand souls , again enjoys the quiet and anonymity of any other mississippi river village .

the once-dominant social network myspace is revamping its home page .	it 's looking a little more like its more popular and populous rival , facebook , even as it attempts to set itself apart .	in simplifying its user home page , myspace is making users ' stream wider and more prominent .	the stream is the constantly updated flow of status updates and shared content , much like the news feed that is front and center in facebook .	myspace also is consolidating recommendations , such as games , events and " people you may know , " into one section instead of scattering them around the page .	and users ' photos , videos , music and events will be combined under a " my stuff " section on their home page .	the redesign is part of a broader overhaul of myspace , as the site works to stay relevant to its current audience and draw in new users , including those who have n't visited in years .	in setting itself apart from facebook ?	which in just a couple of years dethroned myspace as a media darling and internet favorite ?	myspace is focusing on attracting younger users and helping them discover new things .	that has been the site 's forte since its heyday , when teens flocked to myspace to find out about new music and design their often flashy , jumbled home pages .	facebook , meanwhile has become especially popular with the over-35 crowd .	myspace president mike jones said the latest changes are in preparation for a big overhaul in the fall , " so as we turn on the full relaunch it 's not a shock to the system . "	the goal is to be relevant to 13 - to 34-year-olds and help them discover new people and new content .	emarketer analyst debra aho williamson called the redesign smart , a clear departure from the myspace of old that was a " cluttered , messy catchall . " "	do i wish it happened sooner ?	yes , " she said .	but it did n't , and in the meantime facebook has grown to 500 million .	myspace , which is owned by news corp. , has more than 120 million users worldwide . "	myspace and facebook really are n't even competing in the same category any more , " williamson said . "	which is good .	for myspace to be successful they need to carve out their own place . "	myspace remains a go-to place for many new musicians who want to showcase their music and interact with their audience .	if myspace 's overhaul works , making music and entertainment front and center could help it serve the same purpose mtv did a generation ago .	if it does n't , it could go the way of another once-dominant network , friendster .

an alarm that alerts authorities about possible obstructions on san francisco 's world-famous cable car line did n't sound off before a cable car hit a bolt and came to an abrupt stop , injuring seven people , transit officials said thursday .	the alarm did n't sound because the loose bolt came from a street surface plate that was lodged into the tracks , san francisco municipal transportation agency spokesman paul rose told the associated press thursday .	the bolt was above the underground cables that has sensors around it , he said .	wednesday 's mishap occurred after a cable car with about 40 people onboard going downhill at around 9 miles per hour struck a 1 ?	inch bolt in the cable groove and came to a sudden halt .	two other cable cars had passed safely through the site about 10 minutes before the accident .	the agency now plans to conduct weekly checks on each of the bolts and the panels along the renowned five-mile cable car route " to make sure they are secure as possible , " rose said .	transit director john haley said wednesday that several items including those as light as pieces of paper in the past have set off the system 's alarms , so it 's unclear why the metal object did n't .	among the seven injured included a conductor who underwent surgery wednesday from facial and tongue injuries and a gripman who suffered internal injuries and cracked ribs , transit officials said .	five were taken to a hospital , including an elderly man in his 80s with potential life-threatening injuries he suffered a head injury , authorities said .	his condition was not immediately known .

a utah-based convenience store chain has agreed to pay $ 115,000 to settle a federal lawsuit alleging it improperly fired an hiv-positive bakery clerk in wyoming .	u.s. district judge nancy freudenthal of cheyenne on friday signed off on a settlement agreement ending the lawsuit that the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission filed last year against maverik , inc. .	the company operates roughly 200 gas stations in wyoming , utah and other western states .	the lawsuit charged the company violated the americans with disabilities act when it fired a former clerk in 2008 , two weeks after learning he was hiv-positive .	the clerk entered the lawsuit with his own lawyer and will receive the payment .	the settlement , called a consent decree , requires maverik not to discriminate against others on the basis of disability .	it also requires the company to provide ada training to its workers in wyoming and to its supervisors throughout the company .	cheyenne lawyer bruce moats represents the clerk . "	the decree will help raise consciousness within the company of these issues , and i think that 's just as important as the monetary amount , " moats said monday .	the eeoc , in a written statement on monday , said the company had employed the clerk for more than three years .	the agency said the company fired him , " because of an alleged fear that he should not be working with food . "	the agency claimed the company failed to make reasonable accommodations for the clerk .	david hancock , general counsel for maverik in salt lake city , said monday the company denies it violated the law and agreed to settle only to avoid further expenses . "	maverik entered into the consent decree because the eeoc made such an agreement a condition of settlement in the case , " hancock said . "	maverik 's existing policies and procedures are consistent with the decree and applicable law .	maverik firmly stands behind its policies and training that strictly prohibit discrimination . "	hancock declined to say if maverik had some other explanation of why the clerk was fired if it was n't because of concern that he not work in food preparation . "	we just take the position that we did n't violate the law , " he said .	sean ratliff , trial lawyer with the eeoc in denver , said monday his agency was happy with the outcome of the lawsuit . "	the ada prohibits employers from discriminating based on myths or stereotypes about disabilities , " ratliff said . "	and someone who has hiv , there 's nothing about that individual that would prohibit them from working with food , which is what some of the evidence that we had in our lawsuit seemed to show .	now , of course , maverik will contest that . "	ratliff said employers need to know about employees ' impairments so they can make accommodations for them , but do n't necessarily have to know about an employees ' underlying condition . "	it 's enough to know what those impairments are , and at that point , the employer has an obligation to attempt to make reasonable accommodations for that individual , " he said .

"	colon cancer can be prevented , " cdc director dr. thomas r. frieden said during a noon press conference tuesday . "	screening is highly effective . " "	by preventing colon cancer , we can help people live longer , healthier , more productive lives while reducing health-care costs , " he added .	frieden spoke from personal experience . "	i turned 50 a few months ago and i do have a strong family history of colorectal cancer , so i did have a colonoscopy at age 40 , " he told reporters . "	it was normal .	at age 50 , i had another colonoscopy .	i had four polyps -- two of them large -- all of them removed before they became cancerous . "	he added , " if i had n't had colon cancer screening , i could well be dead in another 10 or 15 years .	i anticipate that i will never have colon cancer , because i will continue to get follow-ups .	i hope every american has the ability to access and take advantage of colon cancer screening . "	the report , vital signs : colorectal cancer screening , incidence , and mortality -- united states , 2002-2010 , was published in the july 5 issue of the cdc 's morbidity and mortality weekly report .	not only does colon cancer kill 50,000 americans each year , it 's costly , frieden noted .	the cost for colon cancer in 2010 was $ 14 billion , the report showed .	and each colon cancer death in 2006 cost $ 288,468 in lost productivity .	screening for colon cancer can improve these numbers , according to the report .	from 2002 to 2010 , screening increased from 52 percent to 65 percent .	yet , one in three people ages 50 to 75 are not current with screening recommendations , the cdc investigators found .	although colon cancer screening has increased dramatically , there is a concern that the rate may be leveling off , frieden said , noting that the biggest factor in screening is a doctor 's recommendation .	other findings in the report include : -- death from colon cancer dropped significantly in 49 states and washington , d.c. -- deaths were cut most in states with the highest rates of screening .	-- between 2003 and 2007 , deaths from colon cancer dropped 3 percent .	-- the highest number of deaths from colon cancer was in washington , d.c. -- the lowest number of colon cancer deaths were in montana and colorado .	-- the rate of colon cancer dropped in 35 states from 2003 to 2007 .	-- the most cases were in north dakota ; utah had the fewest .	data for the report were drawn from the cdc 's national program of cancer registries ; the u.s. national cancer institute 's surveillance , epidemiology , and end results program ; and the cdc 's national vital statistics system .	currently , colon cancer screening is recommended for men and women starting at age 50 .	the methods for screening include : -- fecal occult blood test every year .	-- flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years plus a fecal occult blood test every three years .	-- colonoscopy every 10 years if the test was negative .	more information : for more on colon cancer , visit the american cancer society , http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/index .	photo link : http://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/colon10273.jpg stop-smoking drug chantix ups risk of heart problems : study by denise mann the quit-smoking drug chantix may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes by as much as 72 percent in smokers who take it , even those without heart disease , researchers say .	the new study comes just over a week after the u.s. food and drug administration reported a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease using chantix ( varenicline ) . "	all smokers who take chantix are at risk for heart attack , stroke or other cardiovascular event , " said study author dr. sonal singh , an assistant professor of general internal medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore .	the findings , published july 4 in cmaj ( canadian medical association journal ) , are based on a review of 14 studies involving more than 8,200 smokers or users of smokeless tobacco , most of whom had no evidence of heart disease .	about 4,900 took chantix ; the others were given a placebo .	follow-up ranged from 7 to 52 weeks .	the researchers found that 52 ( 1.06 percent ) of the participants taking chantix had serious cardiovascular events compared with 27 ( 0.82 percent ) of those taking the placebo . "	chantix is causing the problems it 's supposed to prevent , " singh said , noting that , in addition to certain cancers , smoking increases heart risks . "	do n't use chantix , and try to quit unassisted , " he said . "	if you ca n't , there are other cheaper and safer alternatives . "	another study author , dr. curt d. furberg , a professor of public health sciences at wake forest university baptist medical center in winston-salem , n.c. , said they found that the risks associated with chantix outweigh any potential benefits . "	chantix can cause cardiovascular problems , and this is on top of other bad news about the drug , " he said .	the fda in 2009 mandated that chantix carry a " black-box " warning about the potential risks of psychiatric problems , including depression and suicidal thoughts .	chantix is not that effective in helping people quit smoking , he said . "	if 10 people start on the drug , nine are back smoking after one year , " he added . "	the benefit is modest at best . "	but pharmaceutical giant pfizer , the maker of chantix , shot back that the drug is a valuable tool for would-be ex-smokers , and the authors ' conclusions are flawed . "	pfizer disagrees with the interpretation of the data , " the company said in a statement . "	the analysis contains several limitations ; most notably that it is based on a small number of events , which raises concerns about the reliability of the authors ' conclusions .	the authors acknowledge that their risk ' estimates are imprecise owing to the low event rates . '	the actual difference in cardiovascular event rates seen in the singh analysis was less than one-quarter of one percent . "	the authors do acknowledge some limitations with their study , including the small number of heart problems overall .	but they advised doctors to consider the potential cardiovascular and psychiatric problems before prescribing chantix .	however , dr. bruce darrow , an assistant professor of cardiology/medicine with the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city , urged caution before jumping to any conclusions about chantix 's future . "	there is not enough evidence to conclude that chantix is unusable or too dangerous to use , but there is enough evidence to suggest there is that possibility , " darrow said .	and pfizer said that it " works with regulators , like the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) , on a continual basis to review and monitor data for chantix .	in particular , we are working with fda to conduct a combined analysis of clinical trial data ( meta-analysis ) , which will help further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of chantix . "	darrow said that if you are already taking chantix , you should discuss what the cmaj study means with your doctor and ask whether or not you should continue .	never stop taking any medication without first discussing it with your doctor , he said .	data on chantix is only available for up to 52 weeks . "	we know that a lot of long-term benefits of stopping smoking are not seen at this point , so if people who use chantix are followed for a longer time , we may see more benefits , " darrow added . "	i would be reluctant to give chantix out of the gate , but there may be some patients who ca n't quit using other methods who go into it with their eyes open , " he said . "	there may be a potential for a small risk of heart disease in the short term , but the three-year risk of heart disease may go down and the long-term risk of lung cancer goes down , " he pointed out .	jeff stier , a senior fellow at the national center for public policy research , a washington , d.c.-based conservative think tank , said this study is n't the final word . "	you need a study that compares any increased risk of a cardiovascular event with chantix to risk seen among those who continue smoking , " he said . "	this study underscores the fact that helping people quit smoking is not a risk-free endeavor , " he added .	more information : for more information on heart disease , visit the u.s. national library of medicine , http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartdiseases.html .	photo link : http://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/hch053.jpg environment may be especially key to autism : study by jenifer goodwin contrary to current thinking , environmental factors may play a larger role than shared genes in the development of autism , a new study in twins suggests .	a second study in the same journal finds that anti-depressants during pregnancy may be one important environmental trigger .	in the first study , researchers from stanford university identified 192 pairs of twins from a statewide california registry of children who receive services for developmental disabilities .	at least one twin was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder , which researchers confirmed by examining and testing each child .	the study included 54 pairs of identical twins ( meaning they share all of the same genes ) and 138 pairs of fraternal twins ( who share half of their genes ) .	about 42.5 percent of the male-male pairs and 43 percent of the female-female pairs of identical twins both had autism .	about 12.9 percent of the male-male fraternal twins and 20 percent of the female-female fraternal twins both had autism , researchers said .	it 's not surprising that the identical twins were more likely to each have autism , since they share all the same genes , explained lead study author dr. joachim hallmayer , an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at stanford university .	research has suggested that genetics play a role in the development of autism .	nevertheless , if a disorder was 100 percent due to genetics , both siblings in each pair of identical twins would have it , which is not the case with autism .	that means the shared environment -- and this could be in utero or in early life -- has to play a major role , the researchers explained .	according to their calculations , this means that genes account for 37 percent of the risk of " classic , " or severe autism and 38 percent of the risk of milder autism spectrum disorders .	by the same calculations , environmental factors would explain 55 percent of the risk of autism and 58 percent of the risk for an autism spectrum disorder , the stanford team concluded . "	i was very surprised .	the environmental influence is stronger than i thought , " hallmayer said . "	it does n't mean that genes do n't play a role , but they may not play as big a role as thought . "	earlier small studies on twins had suggested that genetics accounts for about 90 percent of the autism risk .	researchers pointed out , however , that unlike the stanford study , those studies did not include standard clinical assessments for autism diagnoses .	the stanford study is published in the july 4 online issue of archives of general psychiatry .	the research is interesting and a good reminder that it 's important for researchers to search for environmental triggers of autism , said dr. gary goldstein , president and ceo of the kennedy krieger institute in baltimore .	however , a close look at the statistics shows they might not be as powerful as it seems , goldstein said .	the statistics have a wide " confidence interval , " or range of uncertainty .	for the genetic influence on autism , for example , the confidence interval was 9 percent to 81 percent -- meaning there 's a chance that the actual number could fall anywhere in that range , he said . "	i think everyone in the field believes that genetics are important to autism and that the environment must also be involved .	but we do n't know exactly what those environmental factors are , and how those factors interact with the genes , " goldstein said . "	this study gives further support that we should be looking at both genes and the environment . " "	environmental " influences mean anything that is n't in the genetic code .	research has suggested that a host of possible factors , including advanced maternal or paternal age , assisted reproductive technology and artificial insemination , maternal infections during pregnancy , giving birth to multiples , prematurity and low birth weight and complications during birth , could be among the environmental factors .	one widely-publicized , and now discredited claim , was that the mmr vaccine was a trigger , but the research was found to be fraudulent . "	this study should not lead to a revisit of the vaccine issue , " goldstein said .	another possible environmental factor is the use of certain medications during pregnancy , including antidepressants .	in another study also published in the online issue of the journal , researchers found a two-fold risk of autism spectrum disorder among children whose mothers took antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssri ) during pregnancy , and that the risk was more than three times higher if the mothers took the drugs during early pregnancy , compared to children without the disorder .	ssris include widely used antidepressants such as celexa , paxil , prozac and zoloft .	however , the researchers , from kaiser permanente medical care program in northern california , cautioned that the number of children in the study who were exposed prenatally to ssris was low .	they say that further studies are needed to validate the results .	about 6.7 percent of women who had a child with autism reported taking anti-depressants during pregnancy , compared to 3.3 percent of controls , or women who did not have a child with autism , researchers said .	though the risks and benefits taking any medication during pregnancy should be carefully considered , dr. natalie meirowitz , chief of the division of maternal fetal medicine at long island jewish medical center in new hyde park , advised expectant mothers who suffer from depression not to toss their medications .	that 's because depression itself poses a risk to mother and baby .	depressed women may self-medicate with drugs and alcohol , fail to eat right and keep their prenatal appointments , and be unable to care for their baby after delivery , meirowitz said . "	pregnancy is a very emotional time for women , and we know that a woman who stops her medication needs a lot of support , " she said . "	the decision to stop medications has to be made very carefully with the patients ' psychiatrist , obstetrician and with their significant other .	it should n't be made lightly .

"	having a child who is not talking as much as other children can be very distressing for parents .	our findings suggest that parents should not be overly concerned that late-talking at age 2 years will result in enduring language and psychological difficulties for the child , " said the study 's lead author , andrew whitehouse , an associate professor and reader in developmental psychopathology at the telethon institute for child health research at the university of western australia in subiaco .	results of the study are scheduled to be published in the august issue of pediatrics , but will first be released in the july 4 online edition of the journal .	as many as 18 percent of children have what 's known as an expressive language delay , according to background information in the study .	expressive language is the ability to speak .	receptive language is the ability to understand speech and gestures , according to the american academy of pediatrics .	most children 's language skills eventually catch up to their peers , but it was n't clear whether or not those delays in being able to express themselves would have any lasting effect on the late-talking children .	to get a better idea of how late-talking might affect later psychological health , whitehouse and his colleagues asked caregivers of over 1,600 children to complete a language development survey , and found that 142 of the child were late to start talking .	the investigators followed the children for the next 17 years , conducting five more language and psychosocial assessments , once every two to three years .	at age 2 , the late-talkers had increased levels of behavioral and emotional problems , and whitehouse said that the researchers suspect the reason for these issues at this age was because the toddlers were frustrated that they could n't communicate .	he said that these behavioral and emotional issues did n't endure once the children achieved normal language milestones , and if the children had no other developmental delays . "	our findings suggest that parents should not be overly concerned that late-talking at age 2 years will result in enduring language and psychological difficulties for the child .	there is good evidence that most late-talking children will catch up to the language skills of other children , " said whitehouse . "	the best thing that parents can do is provide a rich language-learning environment for their children , " he added . "	this means getting down on the floor and playing with their child , talking with them , reading to them , interacting with them at their level . " "	these findings are reassuring for parents .	if toddlers just have an expressive language delay , it will often disappear by school age .	and , an early history of an expressive language delay does n't , in and of itself , put kids at risk for later emotional and behavioral problems , " said dr. andrew adesman , chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the steven and alexandra cohen children 's medical center of new york in new hyde park .	though not addressed in this study , adesman said that delays in receptive language or responsiveness are of more concern and should be further evaluated .	following are some receptive language milestones : -- at 15 months , a child should be able to follow a simple one-step command .	-- at 18 months , a child should be able to point to certain body parts when asked .	-- at 2 years old , a child should be able to complete a two-step command , such as " pick up the ball and bring it back to me .

"	it is appropriate for women when deciding how often to get a mammogram to make that decision based on how high their risk is , " schousboe said .	factors to consider , in addition to age , are the woman 's breast density , history of breast biopsy , family history of breast cancer and her beliefs about the potential benefits and risks of screening , schousboe said .	denser breasts are believed to convey a higher risk of breast cancer .	the findings , published july 5 in the annals of internal medicine , challenge age-based guidelines from such groups as the american cancer society and the u.s. preventive services task force and may re-ignite the debate about breast-cancer screening .	in 2009 , the u.s. preventive services task force advised that the decision to start regular screenings every two years before age 50 should be discussed with a woman 's doctor .	it advises screening every other year for women 50 to 74 .	however , the american cancer society and other organizations stand behind their recommendations that women begin annual screening at age 40 .	in the new research , schousboe and his colleagues evaluated data on u.s. women from the breast cancer surveillance consortium and the surveillance epidemiology and end results ( seer ) of the national cancer institute .	they developed a model to compare the lifetime costs and health benefits for women screened annually , every two years , every three to four years , or never .	the results apply to the general population , not to women who carry genetic mutations known as brca1 or 2 that raise their risk of breast cancer .	they concluded that screening every other year from age 40 to 49 could be cost-effective for women with higher-than-average risk levels .	mammography every three to four years was cost-effective for women ages 50 to 79 with low breast density and no other risk factors , they found .	and annual mammograms were not cost-effective for any group , no matter what age or breast density , they said .	if a woman wants to track the four risk factors , it 's important she get an initial mammogram at age 40 to establish her breast density , schousboe said .	to reach their conclusions , the team took into account those four risk factors .	they assumed the women in the model all started out healthy but could advance to six different categories , ranging from remaining healthy to dying of breast cancer or other causes .	they then estimated how many extra mammograms would be needed to prevent one death from breast cancer in those having mammograms every three to four years compared to none , and every two years compared to three to four years .	they also estimated the cost of each mammogram schedule for each quality-adjusted life year , a statistical measure , and considered the impact a " false positive " reading would have on a woman 's quality of life .	the modeling study has limitations , said robert smith , director of cancer screening for the american cancer society , who is familiar with the findings but was not involved in the research . "	a model is n't real life , " smith said .	there is no question that advancing age , greater breast density , a family history of breast cancer or a history of breast biopsy boost the risk of breast cancer , he said .	however , the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a family history , he added .	the risk factors evaluated in the study are major ones but far from the only ones , he said .	also , evaluation of breast density is imprecise , he said .	if 10 radiologists are asked to assign a breast density score , their ratings will likely differ , he said .	funding for the research was provided by eli lilly and co. and the da costa family foundation for research in breast cancer prevention of the california pacific medical center and the breast cancer surveillance consortium .	more information : to learn more about mammograms , visit the american cancer society , http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/examsandtestdescriptions/mammogramsandotherbreastimagingprocedures/index .	photo link : http://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/whi046.jpg massage beats meds for lower back pain , study says by maureen salamon massage therapy may be better than medication or exercise for easing low back pain in the short term , a new government-funded study suggests .	seattle researchers recruited 401 patients , mostly middle-aged , female and white , all of whom had chronic low back pain .	those who received a series of either relaxation massage or structural massage were better able to work and be active for up to a year than those getting " usual medical care , " which included painkillers , anti-inflammatory drugs , muscle relaxants or physical therapy , the researchers found .	lead study author daniel cherkin , director of group health research institute , said he had expected structural massage , which manipulates specific pain-related back muscles and ligaments , would prove superior to relaxation or so-called swedish massage , which aims to promote a feeling of body-wide relaxation .	structural massage , which focuses on soft-tissue abnormalities , requires more training and may be more likely to be paid for by health insurance plans , which may equate it with physical therapy , said cherkin . "	i thought structural massage would have been at least a little better , and that 's not the case , " cherkin said . "	if you 're having continuing problems with back pain even after trying usual medical care , massage may be a good thing to do .	i think the results are pretty strong . "	the study , funded by the national center for complementary and alternative medicine , part of the u.s. national institutes of health , is published in the july 5 issue of annals of internal medicine .	participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups : structural massage , relaxation massage or usual care .	those in the massage groups were given hour-long massage treatments weekly for 10 weeks .	at 10 weeks , more than one-third of those who received either type of massage said their back pain was much better or gone , compared to only one in 25 patients who received usual care , the study said .	those in the massage groups were also twice as likely in that period to have spent fewer days in bed , used less anti-inflammatory medication and engaged in more activity than the standard care group .	six months out , both types of massage were still linked to improved function , cherkin said , but after one year , pain and function was almost equal in all three groups .	noting that most americans will experience low back pain during their lifetime , cherkin said another benefit of massage is its relative safety . "	maybe one of 10 patients felt pain during or after massage , but most of those thought it was a ' good pain , ' " he said . "	a good massage therapist will be in tune with the patient and will ask what hurts . "	one of the study 's weaknesses was that those who were assigned to usual care knew that others were receiving massage therapy and may have been disappointed to be excluded , tainting their reported improvement , said dr. robert duarte , director of the pain and headache treatment center at north shore-lij health system in manhasset , n.y.

"	critical access hospitals play an important and unique role in the u.s. health care system , caring for individuals who live in rural areas and who might otherwise have no accessible inpatient care , " wrote dr. karen e. joynt , of the harvard school of public health , and colleagues . "	the cah designation was created with the goal of ensuring ' proximate access ' to basic inpatient and emergency care close to home for approximately 20 percent of the u.s. population that still lives in rural communities , " the researchers explained .	for this study , they looked at 2008-09 data on patients with heart attack , congestive heart failure , and pneumonia .	care in accordance with hospital quality alliance process measures was provided to : 91 percent of heart attack patients in cahs and 97.8 percent of those in non-cahs : 80.6 percent of congestive heart failure patients in cahs and 93.5 percent of those in non-cahs ; 89.3 percent of pneumonia patients in cahs and 93.7 percent of those in non-cahs .	patients in the small , rural critical care hospitals had higher 30-day death rates for all three conditions than the non-cahs : 23.5 percent vs. 16 .	2 percent for heart attack ; 13.4 percent vs. 10.9 percent for congestive heart failure ; and 14.1 percent vs. 12.1 percent for pneumonia .	the researchers also found that cahs were less likely to have intensive care units , cardiac catheterization capabilities , and basic electronic health records .	the study appears in the july 6 issue of the journal of the american medical association . "	despite more than a decade of concerted policy efforts to improve rural health care , our findings suggest that substantial challenges remain .	although cahs provide much-needed access to care for many of the nation 's rural citizens , we found that these hospitals , with their fewer clinical and technological resources , less often provided care consistent with standard quality metrics and generally had worse outcomes than non-cahs , " the authors concluded .	researchers said the findings should serve as to focus attention on improve quality of care at rural hospitals , " so that all individuals in the united states have access to high-quality inpatient care regardless of where they live .

winter weather returned to south carolina on tuesday bringing snow to the upstate and midlands and freezing rain to the coast , causing many schools to cancel classes or open late .	while the storm brought more than 2 inches of snow to some places , a second storm expected to move in wednesday promised to bring more .	the national weather service in greer posted a winter storm watch for wednesday night for some areas in the upstate .	forecasters there and in columbia said the second storm would bring moderate snow to both the upstate and midlands .	on tuesday , a winter weather advisory was in effect for most of the state with a freezing rain advisory for charleston and outlying counties .	in the myrtle beach area , media and law enforcement agencies reported that several bridges near the coast were closed because of ice and accidents , and roads in rural areas inland were icy .	power companies across the state reported only a handful of outages at late morning .	by midday the storm brought 2.5 inches of snow to pickens county , 1.6 inches to greenville county and 1 inch to walhalla in the mountains .	there was a dusting of snow in the many areas in the midlands .	the national weather service in greer issued a winter storm watch for the second storm in an advisory saying low pressure would form in the gulf of mexico on wednesday morning and track northeast across georgia into the carolinas .	it said while the storm was expected to bring moderate snowfall , its track was still uncertain and it was too early to project just how much .	it said winter storm warnings could be posted later .	a watch means there 's a potential for heavy snow and ice .	a warning means the storm is bringing , or will bring , heavy snow and ice .	while snow was expected into the midlands , farther east the second storm was to bring some sleet and mainly rain .

metadata associated with electronic documents ?	such as the " to " and " from " fields in e-mails ?	is a public record subject to disclosure , washington 's supreme court ruled thursday .	the 5-4 ruling concerned a shoreline resident 's request under the public records act for an e-mail that had been sent to the city 's deputy mayor .	the resident received a copy of the e-mail without the metadata and subsequently filed a request for the information . "	metadata may contain information that relates to the conduct of government and is important for the public to know , " justice susan owens wrote . "	it could conceivably include information about whether a document was altered , what time a document was created , or who sent a document to whom . "	owens wrote that only one other state high court ?	arizona 's ?	has considered the question , and it too held that that the information is subject to disclosure .	the issue has arisen elsewhere as courts grapple with the intersection of technology and disclosure laws .	an appeals court in new york ruled early this year that an agency should have released certain metadata associated with photographs pursuant to a disclosure request .	metadata is generally defined as data about data , and it can include information such as the address fields in e-mails , file types , file creation and modification dates , and the author of such modifications .	it can be used to authenticate e-mails and other electronic documents .	that type of information became important to shoreline resident beth o'neill in 2006 , when the city 's deputy mayor , maggie fimia , claimed at a public meeting that o'neill had sent an e-mail accusing the city council of improper conduct in a zoning dispute .	o'neill had not written or forwarded any such e-mail , and she wanted to know why fimia was claiming she had .	it turned out that o'neill 's name was mentioned in an e-mail fimia received from someone else .	after the meeting , fimia forwarded the e-mail from her city account to her personal account ?	stripping out the address fields in an effort to protect the identity of the person who sent her the e-mail .	that copy of the e-mail was eventually turned over to o'neill , who was n't satisfied .	she asked for the original e-mail with its metadata .	fimia searched her e-mail folders and concluded she must have accidentally deleted it .	the high court ruled it was improper for fimia to delete the original e-mail , especially since it was subject to a public disclosure request .	because fimia used her personal computer for official business , the justices sent the case back to a lower court with instructions for the city to search the hard drive of fimia 's home computer in an attempt to find the metadata .	the four-justice minority took issue with that .	under the law , a public record is defined as a record held by a government agency ?	not one that exists on a city employee 's home computer , justice gerry alexander wrote .	if the communication had been a written letter , rather than an e-mail , alexander said he doubted the court would require the city to search fimia 's home recycling bin in an effort to find an envelope that might verify where and when the letter was mailed .	o'neill 's attorney , michele earl-hubbard , said she was pleased the court ruled that metadata is subject to public disclosure , but disappointed that the court sent the case back without finding an outright violation of the public records act which would require shoreline to pay o'neill penalties for improperly withholding records . "	our supreme court here says yes , there are electronic parts of records that may have value , and an agency may not destroy them , " earl-hubbard said . "	that 's a big part of the accountability picture . "	shoreline city attorney richard sievers did not immediately return a message seeking comment .

wineries will not be able to ship their products directly to customers in delaware after a house committee on wednesday rejected a bill opposed by the liquor industry .	after more than an hour of debate , the economic development and commerce committee voted 5-3 not to release the bill that would have allowed the sales for consideration by the full house .	supporters of the bill said it would give wine lovers a convenient way to buy their favorites that may not be available at local liquor stores .	some 35 other states already allow such direct purchases . "	this is a bill that 's brought to me by citizens , " said chief sponsor rep. deborah hudson , r-greenville .	but opponents said the bill would be hard to enforce , and that it would take money from wholesalers and retailers . "	you 're clearly shifting the revenue base from in-state wholesalers and retailers to out-of-state wineries , " said mihir patel of the small business leadership council , a group that represents package store owners and other alcohol licensees .	michael ciabattoni , a representative of the teamsters union , said direct shipments would hurt drivers and warehousemen who work in delaware 's three-tier distribution system . "	this is something that will hurt all aspects of the industry , " said ciabattoni , who suggested that instead of allowing consumers to buy wine directly , delaware should follow maryland 's lead and make it a felony .	meanwhile , congress is considering legislation proposed by wholesale distributors that opponents fear could limit wineries ' ability to sell and ship directly to consumers by reinforcing states ' rights to regulate alcohol sales .	supporters of the delaware bill said concerns about its impact , including that it would make it easier for minors to obtain alcohol , were being exaggerated . "	we 've heard a lot of stories here today , " said roger roy , a lobbyist for the wine institute . "	there is not one winery that has been cited by any government entity for shipping to a minor where it 's allowed by law , " roy said .	roy dismissed the notion that consumers would begin bypassing retailers all together , noting that a bottle shipped directly likely would be more expensive than the same bottle at a retail store because it will not be subject to bulk shipment discounts .	hudson noted that , at the behest of other committee members , she had agreed to amend the original bill , which would have allowed a person to buy up to 24 cases from a particular winery per year , to allow only 12 cases per person per year from all wineries . "	you 're not permitted to get 12 from this winery and 12 from the next , " explained state alcoholic beverage control commissioner john cordrey .	under the bill , a winery would have to pay $ 100 for a shipping license that could be renewed every two years and pay excise taxes on sales to delaware residents .	shippers such as ups and fedex also would have to obtain licenses from the state in order to deliver wine .	siobhan sullivan , director of the division of alcohol and tobacco enforcement said the paper trail created by the bill would make it easier to investigate complaints of illegal sales , but that it would be impossible to monitor carriers to make sure they are not making illegal deliveries , such as to minors .

the latest livestock attack by oregon 's snake river wolf pack puts it one bite away from a potential state kill order .	an oregon department of fish and wildlife report released monday says the rancher who found a wounded cow nov. 21 in the rugged country between the imnaha and snake rivers had taken required nonlethal steps to deter wolf attacks .	those steps included cleaning up old cow carcasses , putting out radio-activated alarm boxes and checking the cattle up to five times a day .	the report says bite marks on the cow 's hindquarters were characteristics of wolf attacks .	the wounds were estimated to be a week or two old , and a gps tracking collar put the pack in the area at that time .	new rules established under a legal settlement allow officials to consider a kill order after four qualifying attacks by a wolf pack in six months .	the most recent attack makes three for the snake river pack since october .	unlike other states trying to control wolves in cattle country , oregon has adopted specific rules requiring ranchers to take nonlethal steps to deter wolf attacks before the state can shoot a wolf for attacking livestock .	the rules were the result of a legal settlement of a lawsuit from conservation groups .	steve pedery of oregon wild , one of plaintiffs , says the department is faithfully carrying out the new rules .	he noted that the number of attacks by the imnaha pack has gone down as nonlethal efforts have gone up .	the imnaha pack was oregon 's first and had the most livestock kills last year when a decision to shoot two of its members was blocked by court order . "	i think the agency deserves a lot of credit for following the letter of the plan , putting out reports and making them public , which is a big change over where we were a couple years ago , " pedery said .	russ morgan , wolf coordinator for the department , said more ranchers have bought into nonlethal control in the range of the imnaha pack , where they have been dealing with wolves for a longer time .	however , it is still uncertain whether the nonlethal controls are responsible , he said .	morgan added that the imnaha pack is made up of different wolves , except for the breeding pair , than when the pack was more actively attacking livestock .	young adults have moved on , and the pack has at least seven new pups .	rancher rod childers , who negotiated the rules on behalf of the oregon cattlemen 's association , said ranchers are still frustrated with the slow pace of the process , which can take a week or more to confirm a kill and determine whether it qualifies under the rules . "	people are learning it 's here and we 've got to deal with it , " he said of the seven confirmed wolf packs in northeastern oregon . "	we just want it dealt with in a more timely manner than what it is . "

wyoming lawmakers wrapped up their first week of hearings on gov. matt mead 's proposed budget friday , setting the stage for debate on his call for fundamental changes in state fiscal policies when the legislature convenes next month .	a legislative committee also voted friday to reject a proposal to expand the medicaid program , a cornerstone of the federal affordable care act .	mead has urged lawmakers to reject a proposed $ 50 million federal medicaid expansion .	he has said the federal government has failed to give the state details about how the proposed expansion would work and whether the federal government can afford to live up to its promises to continue to pay the bulk of the ongoing costs .	mead earlier this month said his proposed supplemental budget for the fiscal year that starts next july advocates " some fairly big sea changes , " in state fiscal policy .	mead has asked lawmakers to redirect roughly $ 130 million a year of energy revenues away from permanent savings into the state 's " rainy day " fund , where it could be spent on state projects and operations .	mead also has proposed changing how the state handles the proceeds from the sale of assets held by the state 's permanent mineral trust fund , which holds nearly $ 6 billion .	the fund sells different types of securities when it 's necessary to rebalance the distribution of money among different classifications of investments .	mead proposes to allow some of the proceeds from this " rebalancing " to also go into the rainy day fund , called the legislative stabilization reserve account .	and he 's pushing to direct millions from federal coal lease bonus money into the same fund , moving it away from school construction .	mead says his proposals are aimed at increasing the state 's ability to access ready cash in case it 's necessary to fund operations .	state fiscal analysts generally predict flat revenues for coming years due to stagnating energy prices and faltering demand for coal .	sen. phil nicholas , the outgoing chairman of the senate appropriations committee , said he opposes mead 's suggestions to reduce the amount of state mineral revenues going into permanent savings and siphon off money from rebalancing of the fund . "	i do n't think the fiscal profile warrants that kind of a transfer , " nicholas , r-laramie , said of reducing money going into the permanent fund . "	in addition , i 'm of the strong belief that we see a lot of benefit from increasing the corpus of the trust fund to improve our investment earnings , " he said .	rep. ken esquibel , a member of the house appropriations committee , said he supports mead 's call to redirect the mineral revenues to the state 's rainy day account .	the democrat from cheyenne said he 'd rather see the money go into the state 's general fund , where the legislature would spend it with no strings attached .	the joint appropriations committee will reconvene in early january and mark up mead 's budget proposal before sending its own recommendation to the full legislature .	nicholas said lawmakers are going over mead 's proposed budget and looking at what he identified as more than $ 60 million in agency spending cuts to see whether they would truly reduce state spending .	sen. charles scott , r-casper , chairman of the senate labor , health and social services committee , said friday that his committee voted against amending a bill to specify that the state would accept the medicaid expansion .	he said he does n't believe federal promises to pay the bulk of the expanded program costs .	scott said he expects to see a bill in the coming legislative session that would require wyoming to accept the proposed federal medicaid expansion .	rep. elaine harvey , r-lovell , is labor chairman on the house side and said she voted against the expansion . "	there are many people who just do n't have a choice , and i respect that , and i believe that those are the people who belong on medicaid , " she said after the meeting . "	but if there are people that are on the tipping point that choose medicaid , i do n't want to incentivize them to stay there . "

illinois ' slow implementation of a teacher evaluation program aimed at grading teachers partly on whether their students ' test scores are improving is creating problems for statewide school districts that for the first time will be using the groundbreaking reforms beyond chicago .	problems include the state 's inability so far to obtain a waiver from some of the more punitive tenets of the federal no child left behind act , including requiring 100 percent of students to be proficient in reading and math by 2014 .	the 34 individual districts making evaluation changes this year also say they 're not getting help in preparing to implement them . "	the state board has not given much guidance with incorporating the student growth , " tim buss , superintendent of wabash district 348 in downstate mt. carmel said , where his 1600-student district this fall will beginning tying student performance to evaluations for its 125 teachers . "	they talked about coming out with a template , we have yet to see that . "	as districts change how they judge teachers , there is little state support available , eastern illinois university education chair marleis trover said , particularly for districts which do n't have a large administrative staff or ca n't afford to hire outside help . "	the whole idea is a good idea , " trover said of the reforms . "	but it 's implementation . "	illinois ' 2009 performance evaluation reform act requires districts to design and implement evaluation systems that assess teachers ' and principals ' professional skills .	by 2016 , 70 percent of a teacher 's evaluation will be based on observations of classroom performance .	the other 30 percent will be based on " student growth " ?	students ' improvement on a combination of national , district or teacher-developed tests .	while all illinois teachers must be rated using the same categories ?	excellent , proficient , needs improvement or unsatisfactory ?	districts will decide which assessments they 'll use to gauge student growth .	state law now requires performance , not seniority , to be prioritized in layoff decisions .	high ratings are required for at least two consecutive years before tenure is granted .	the law was hailed as historic , and part of a national trend , spurred by states ' desire to qualify for the obama administration 's race to the top federal education grants .	the student growth component of the evaluations will be phased in , with all districts tying student performance to teacher evaluations by the 2016-17 .	last year , chicago public schools began incorporating student tests into evaluations .	this fall , 34 districts which received federal education stimulus money ?	including wabash ?	will begin using the new criteria .	the lowest performing 20 percent of schools come next , in 2015 .	in 2011 , president barack obama administration began offering an " out " to the federal education law passed a decade before , which works by punishing districts for not meeting federal benchmarks .	waivers , the administration said , would be given to states that agreed to adopt certain education ideas , such as teacher evaluations tied to student test scores .	illinois quickly sought a waiver in 2012 because of its implementation timetable on evaluations .	it continues to wait on a verdict . "	the issue has been how quickly we implement teacher evaluations , " state board of education spokeswoman mary fergus said . "	the feds would like that to be a year earlier .	we have said we 'd like to follow what 's in the state law . "	earlier this summer , the u.s. department of ed .	announced it 's now permitting some case-by-case flexibility on states ' timelines in using growth in teacher evaluations .	illinois is seeking an exception .	states nationwide ?	including wisconsin , indiana , florida and nevada ?	have been given waivers , after their teacher evaluation systems were approved by the department .	meanwhile , the number of schools in illinois labeled " failing " by the federal government continues to increase .	more than 82 percent of the state 's 860 school districts failed to meet federal benchmarks in 2012 , up from 64 percent in 2010 , according to the state board .	fergus said a state board study expected to be finished next fall will review cps and the race to the top fund recipients ' usage of the new evaluation systems .	a state appointed committee has yet to come up with an evaluation model to use as a blueprint for districts statewide , something local superintendents say would help eliminate problems .	districts are calling for more guidance now . "	we want to be proactive rather than reactive , " niles district 219 assistant superintendent anne roloff said .	roloff said that since the state began cutting its education budget , there has been a severe lack of help and oversight from the state board .	persisting budget problems have prompted $ 800 million in cuts since 2009 .	in chicago , officials expect to finish the evaluation work later this month , cps spokeswoman molly poppe said .	sue sporte , the director of research operations for the consortium on chicago school research , said cps teachers revealed in surveys and interviews they were apprehensive about the evaluation changes last year . "	there was a lot of misinformation about it , how much ( the test scores would count ) , " she said .	the consortium , a part of the university of chicago and independent from the district , conducts research and helps cps recognize how the district is functioning .	but since many illinois districts do n't have that kind of outside help , other organizations , including the illinois teacher evaluation development program , are are stepping in to help districts statewide craft new evaluation plans . "	i think we 're on the right track but we do n't have all the pieces , " trover said . "	i think we 're building the capacity . "

general electric co. is expected to post a dip in profit for the second quarter ?	but it is also expected to outline a robust outlook for the rest of the year when it reports results friday . "	we anticipate an uninspiring quarter from ge , " christopher glynn , an analyst at oppenheimer & co. , wrote in a recent report . "	we expect strong orders , however . "	ge 's results in recent quarters have been helped by the growing economies of the developing world and a slowly improving u.s. economy , but held back by a weak economy in europe .	the company is in the midst of transforming itself into a more focused conglomerate that sells industrial equipment , services and appliances .	it is shedding divisions such as nbc universal and shrinking its banking operations .	the move appears to be working ?	ge 's net income has grown in each of the past four quarters compared with the year earlier .	but results have been helped by asset sales and other nonrecurring items , and analysts are still looking for sustained growth from all the company 's industrial divisions .	that probably did n't happen in the second quarter , analysts say .	but in recent months the company 's backlog of business ?	orders that have been placed but not yet filled ?	has shown strong growth .	analysts expect ge to update investors on the company 's progress in turning those orders into sales .	what to watch for : ge 's adjusted earnings are expected to slip in the quarter , but investors expect rosy growth projections for the rest of the year .	sales and orders for gas-fired turbines , aircraft engines and oil and gas drilling equipment are all expected to rise substantially this year .	why it matters : ge sells a broad array of equipment and services around the world , so its financial performance can shed light on the state of the global economy .	ge sells aircraft engines , appliances , locomotives , medical devices such as ct scanners , gas-fired turbines , wind turbines and oil and gas drilling equipment .	ge is a component of the dow jones industrial average .	what 's expected : analysts expect ge to make 35 cents per share , adjusted to exclude special items such as asset sales , according to factset .	that would be 3 cents per share less than the company 's adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share during last year 's second quarter .	analysts expect revenue of $ 35.6 billion , a decline of 3 percent from last year .	last year 's quarter : ge earned $ 3.1 billion , or 29 cents per share , on revenue of $ 36.5 billion in the second quarter of 2012 .	last year 's quarter was hurt by charges from financing companies that had been sold off several years before .
the country almost certainly would not default on its loans to bond holders , but all other payments would be thrown into doubt .	that could start a cascading effect on jobs , loans , investments , prices -- virtually every facet of americans ' financial lives .	some republicans in congress dispute the level of chaos that would ensue , charging that the treasury department is trumping up the potential repercussions .	they include rep. michele bachmann and former governor tim pawlenty of minnesota , both presidential candidates , as well as prominent senators such as south carolina 's jim demint and pennsylvania 's pat toomey .	prominent economists and accountants , business leaders and veterans of republican administrations disagree , pointing to potentially calamitous results if the nation 's $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling is n't raised by aug. 2 . "	the federal government will run short of money and be unable to pay approximately half of its non-interest bills , " says jay powell , a treasury undersecretary in president george h.w. bush 's administration . "	those who believe otherwise have been misinformed . "	here are some of the grim realities : q : would we really default on our treasury bonds ?	( at ) a : ( at ) almost definitely not .	there would be plenty of money to pay interest to investors , thereby avoiding a technical default .	q : who would n't get paid then ?	( at ) a : ( at ) it could be anybody , under a " prioritization " scenario that treasury has been unwilling to discuss because officials insist it simply must be avoided .	q : what would happen to social security recipients ?	( at ) a : ( at ) more than half of the nation 's beneficiaries are due to receive their monthly payment on aug. 3 , and three smaller payments are due later in the month .	president obama said this week that he could not promise they would get paid -- though politically speaking , it 's likely that they would .	q : could n't we pay for all the essential things and just cut the waste ?	( at ) a : ( at ) not unless you believe 41 ( percent ) of the federal budget is a waste .	in august , for instance , the government will take in $ 172 billion but will owe $ 307 billion .	that 's $ 135 billion that could not be paid .	assuming that $ 29 billion in interest on treasury securities is paid , you 're left with about half the money needed .	q : so what would be the priorities ?	( at ) a : ( at ) it 's anybody 's guess .	if treasury paid for social security , medicare , medicaid , unemployment insurance and defense contractors in august , it would be out of money .	that would leave out the military and veterans ' programs , other safety-net benefits and virtually every government agency and employee .	q : would there be broader economic effects ?	( at ) a : ( at ) almost certainly .	the most likely is a rise in interest rates , prompted by a decline in the number of bidders for new treasury bonds .	that would raise the costs of home mortgages , student loans , credit cards and auto loans .	it also would increase the federal deficit by raising interest rates on the debt .	q : what about personal investments ?	( at ) a : ( at ) if the economy goes into a swoon , the stock market will feel the effects , and your 401 ( k ) and other accounts could take a beating . "	it 's going to be negative , " says david walker , former u.s. comptroller general . "	the question is , we just do n't know how much . "	q : how about jobs ?	( at ) a : ( at ) again , it depends on how deep the economic impact , but certainly the unemployment rate could increase because of the federal dollars that are missing and the jolt to financial markets .	q : what would happen to the government 's triple-a bond ratings ?	( at ) a : ( at ) all three major ratings agencies have sent warnings , but it 's unclear whether they would downgrade the ratings unless the united states actually defaults on its bonds , which is unlikely .	q : how does our situation compare to other countries with debt problems , such as greece ?	( at ) a : ( at ) it 's not nearly as bad -- but the trends are headed in that direction .	the u.s. public debt -- what we owe to private investors , much of it held overseas -- is about 70 ( percent ) the size of the economy .	counting state and local debt , it 's 93 ( percent ) .	in greece , it 's about 130 ( percent ) .

@ by paul davidson usa today faced with rising costs , general electric is moving production of its new energy-efficient water heater halfway around the world .	the country it 's leaving ?	china .	the one it 's bringing 400 jobs and a newly renovated factory ?	the united states .	a small but growing band of u.s. manufacturers - including giants such as general electric , ncr and caterpillar - are turning the seemingly inexorable offshoring movement on its head , bringing some production to the u.s. from far-flung locations such as china .	others that were buying components overseas are switching to u.s. suppliers .	ford motor said wednesday that it 's bringing nearly 2,000 jobs to its u.s. plants by 2012 from suppliers , including those in japan , mexico and india .	experts say the initiatives could moderate job losses that have dramatically shrunk the u.s. manufacturing industry . "	i think we 're going to start to see a slowing of lost jobs , and we 'll see some jobs coming back , " says simon ellis , an analyst for idc manufacturing insights . "	at some point , it will balance out , and we 'll reach an equilibrium . "	there are myriad reasons for the shifts , often called " onshoring " or " reshoring . "	chinese wages and shipping costs have risen sharply in the past few years while u.s. salaries have stayed flat , or in some cases , fallen in the recession .	meanwhile , u.s. manufacturers have been frustrated by the sometimes poor quality of goods made by foreign contractors , theft of their intellectual property and long product-delivery cycles that make them less responsive to customer demand .	several cite the drawbacks of tying up valuable capital in huge overseas shipments , and want to bring assembly closer to engineers , suppliers and customers , concerns that mounted as makers slashed costs in the downturn .	others are simply weary of midnight phone calls - and multiple annual trips - to asia . "	a lot of companies who have gone there to take advantage of cheap labor are starting to tell us that if you ( calculate ) total ... cost and do n't just look at wages , it 's actually not worth it , " says jeremy leonard , consultant for manufacturers alliance/mapi , an industry-funded research group .	to be sure , examples of companies moving production to the u.s. are dwarfed by the many more still shuttering u.s. plants and moving to china , india or elsewhere .	no one tracks such data , but one glaring , if imprecise , barometer is the u.s. trade deficit , which hit an 18-month high of $ 42.3 billion in may .	onshoring " is a trickle ; it 's not a flood , " says scott paul , executive director of the alliance for american manufacturing , a trade group . "	there 's still more going out than coming in . "	products that are labor-intensive and churned out in high volumes , such as apparel , textiles and tvs , will likely continue to be made overseas .	so will those that are relatively inexpensive to ship but high-priced , such as laptops and cellphones , ellis says .	goods are increasingly being made near customers , a trend that 's driving u.s. makers to build factories in fast-growing china .	still , says jim campbell , ceo of ge 's appliance unit : " the biggest difference is the u.s. is in the game now . "	rethinking options in a june survey by mfg.com , 21 percent of north american manufacturers said they 'd brought production into , or closer to , the continent in the past three months , up from 12 percent in the first quarter ; 38 percent planned to research such a move in the next three months . "	more companies are looking at their options , " says sean correll , senior director of consulting firm emptoris .	he says most of his firm 's clients , which include 250 of the fortune 1,000 , are weighing onshoring , up from a handful 18 months ago .	meanwhile , many u.s. makers that were planning to move abroad are rethinking their strategies , says craig giffi , vice chairman of consulting firm deloitte .	for decades , offshoring has dominated , driven by chinese factory wages that were a tenth of u.s. pay .	imports make up about a third of all goods purchased in the usa , up from 10 percent in the early 1970s , according to the national association of manufacturers .	u.s. manufacturing employment , after peaking at 19.4 million in 1978 , is 11.6 million , though automation also contributed to sizable job losses .	more than 2 million factory jobs were cut in the recession alone .	yet , the u.s. still had 21 percent of global manufacturing in 2008 , more than any other nation .	the tide may be easing , if not quite turning .	wages for chinese factory workers , bolstered by recent strikes , have jumped 15 percent a year the past decade , ellis says , but they 're still a fraction of u.s. pay .	shipping costs are up about 71 percent the past four years as a result of higher oil prices and cutbacks in ships and containers in the slump , says ihs global insight .	with the cost gap between the u.s. and other countries narrowing for other expenses , such as class-action lawsuits , making products in the usa is now about 22 percent higher than the average of nine of its largest trading partners , down from 32 percent in 2006 , according to a study by leonard .	for ge , the increase in foreign costs tipped scales already shifting to the u.s. for certain products .	the industrial giant announced last year that it will move assembly of its energy-efficient water heater from chinese contractors to its own factory in louisville in 2011 .	the company took advantage of a 2005 labor contract under which employees at the new plant in louisville will be paid an average of $ 13 an hour , down from $ 22 prior to the agreement .	ge also got state and local tax credits of $ 25 million over 10 years , and federal incentives that encourage the manufacture of energy-saving products .	at the same time , the year-old water heater is a high-tech , high-growth model - it can delay heating if electric rates are high - and " something we would like to control , " campbell says . "	we do n't want to just park that with another company to build .	when you have it in your plant , the cycle time ( is ) faster , and you can do launches quicker . "	for example , he says , making the device in louisville already has allowed engineers to work closely with production managers and assembly-line workers to perfect the product 's design via prototypes .	the approach has helped the company eliminate redundant parts and trim per-unit costs by $ 20 .	by contrast , he says , with the heater made in china , " you ship it abroad , guys make it , and if there 's a problem , it 's not going to be fixed initially . "	the company , he says , also worries that china 's recent decision to let its currency rise against the dollar will " drive our costs up . "	ge plans to make other advanced products in the u.s. , noting a 30 percent chinese cost advantage likely has tilted to roughly a 6 percent u.s. edge when figuring lower inventory expenses and fewer delivery snafus .	within five years , he says , ge plans to move a " significant piece " of overseas appliance production to the u.s. , creating hundreds more jobs .	ncr was similarly motivated by a more nuanced view of costs when it decided to move manufacturing of atms sold in the u.s. from china , india and hungary to a new 260-employee plant in columbus , ga. , last october .	the atms scan checks , providing an image receipt , and let customers put cash and checks into them without an envelope .	besides uniting engineers with assembly-line workers , ncr wanted designers to be close to suppliers , customers and universities that quickly trained employees , says peter dorsman , head of global operations .	large bank customers , he says , came up with the idea for the atms . "	you 're including suppliers and customers in the design activity so when it gets to the marketplace , you go from one or two units to mass production quickly , " dorsman says .	quality issues others have grown frustrated by the spotty quality of foreign goods .	sleek audio , which makes high-end earphones , has moved most manufacturing from chinese contractors to its plant in manatee county , fla. , in the past year .	contractors have turned out poorly soldered cables , defective connectors and torn flanges , says ceo mark krywko .	the start-up once had to scrap several hundred thousand dollars ' worth of earphones due to a bad cable , and production mistakes have cost it millions of dollars in retail sales . "	you would have batches that were good and batches that were bad , " krywko says , adding that he had to hire four employees to inspect shipments .	meanwhile , he says , chinese labor and raw-material costs have risen even as u.s. suppliers cut their prices in the slump .	although making the earphones in china is still 20 percent cheaper , " dad got a few more gray hairs , " says krywko 's son , jason , the firm 's vice president .	the krywkos also tired of making six two-week trips a year to china .	and with china 12 hours ahead of the east coast , jason had to call contractors almost daily at about 11 p.m. " my wife loves that , " he says .	the company has hired five employees at its florida plant and plans to add another 15 .	no shipping headaches other reasons manufacturers are switching to the u.s. : -- lower inventory costs and fewer shipping hassles .	@ diagnostic devices , which makes blood-glucose testing strips and monitors for diabetics , has to ship about 20 percent more product than it needs because of the month-long trek ships take to the u.s. from contractors in china and taiwan , says chief operating officer rick admani abulhaj .	the company also keeps about $ 4 million of extra goods in the warehouse in case of delays , forcing it to tie up a total $ 6.5 million in inventory compared with about $ 1 million if products are made in the u.s. .	if products are defective , replacing them takes five months after figuring squabbles with contractors , shipments of raw materials back to asia and reviews of new samples , he says .	in september , the company plans to move production of the strips to a new factory in charlotte , where most of the manufacturing process will be automated to cut labor costs .	monitor-making is scheduled to move to charlotte by the end of 2011 .	the firm is hiring 20 employees .	-- protection of intellectual property .	@ with intellectual-property laws often enforced less vigorously in asia , many manufacturers complain about counterfeiting .	farouk systems , a top maker of hair irons and hair dryers , has spent $ 500,000 a month battling counterfeiters who put the company 's trademark on copies of farouk 's products , says ceo farouk shami . "	counterfeiting is killing us , " he says .	to remedy the problem and whittle inventory costs to $ 50 million @from $ 120 million , farouk last july moved some assembly of its irons and dryers from south korea and china to a houston factory that employs 1,000 .	manufacturing costs in china are still about 30 percent lower .	but farouk believes the appliances ' " made in the usa " stamp will increase sales to hair salons .	-- ease of meeting customer demand .	@ the outdoor great room co. had to order products such as fire pits nine months in advance to fit into its chinese contractors ' production schedule and account for shipping lags .	most sales are in the fall , forcing the firm to forecast customer design preferences and sales volumes well in advance . "	you 're locked in , " says ceo dan shimek . "	you might buy the wrong inventory that moves slower than you 'd like . "	by moving manufacturing of fire pits and some outdoor shelters to the u.s. the past year , the company now can place orders just three months in advance .	onshoring also has been a boon for suppliers .	three supplier trade groups joined forces last year for a marketing campaign to push manufacturers to bring production back to the u.s. " i 'd like to reduce the amount that 's offshored by 30 percent to 40 percent , " says harry moser , a former machine tool executive who conceived the effort .	at a may trade fair in irvine , calif. , 18 of 28 manufacturers that attended asked suppliers for quotes on purchases they would like to switch to u.s. sources .	sales for vehicle gear supplier morey are up 70 percent over last year as makers and fleet managers shift purchases to the u.s. , says vice president taymur ahmad .	morey , which makes devices that track vehicle location , speed and maintenance data , has hired 110 employees at its woodridge , ill. , plant since october . "	i 'm getting business that 's unprecedented , " ahmad says . "	and it 's all from customers that are looking to buy locally . "

it turns out all the indiana department of revenue really needed was an it audit .	of course , to the layman , the fact that such a thing exists is probably a surprise , let alone that it would have caught $ 526 million worth of tax errors that resulted in layoffs , pay cuts and other strains associated with the massive budget cuts made over the last four years .	while the $ 526 million figure is a simple , if massive number , on the surface , underneath that massive amount of money are hundreds of thousands of individual financial transactions and decades of statutes and politics .	the $ 320 million error found in december was discovered through one of 28 tax " streams " that carry the sales , income , corporate and other taxes into the state .	the $ 206 million mistake that the state discovered earlier this month was money supposed to be sent out to the counties .	in both problems , computer programming is being blamed , specifically errors in the state 's tax return processing system .	state board of accounts chief bruce hartman , who conducted an initial review for lawmakers , says his agency is only required to conduct a sweeping financial audit and reviews triggered by allegations of waste and fraud .	it is n't required to conduct it audits , which would have caught this $ 526 million in errors .	the complex issue has launched an intense political battle over who should get to pry , and where .	gov. mitch daniels originally said his administration would handle the financial review alone .	the legislature 's republican leaders later insisted on having their say in how the audit is done .	democrats have called for an expansive independent audit that would look beyond computer programming errors . "	is there anything we are looking at today that would go beyond programming to operational checks and controls ? "	asked sen. karen tallian , d-portage , during a state budget committee hearing friday at which lawmakers discussed the problems .	hartman responded by ticking off a bubba-gump shrimp-style list of reviews designed to catch errors before they grow into hundreds of millions of dollars and start costing people their jobs : " there are a number of types of audits , " he said . "	there are financial audits , there are compliance audit , there are internal audits done by staff of the agency , there 's it audits and there are efficiency or operational audits . "	and then there 's the trigger , the point at which inside an audit things get examined more closely .	the industry term is " materiality . "	broadly , for indiana , the " materiality " trigger is $ 70 million .	things below that level do n't get a separate vetting because there just is n't enough time or resources to check every single blip , hartman said .	error is built into the equation .	indeed , the state 's local income tax process itself has error built into its equation .	the state hands out money to counties based on last year 's collections , and the two are constantly adjusting who owes who what .	john mikesell , a professor of public budgeting at indiana university , noted that the transfers between other states and their localities are routine and almost never perfect . "	correct allocations between state and local components and between localities has been a problem in other states in the past , but the indiana error sets a record for size of the mistake , " mikesell wrote in an email to the associated press .	a deputy director for the federation of tax administrators has called indiana 's $ 320 million error " eye-catching , " noting that states routinely have errors in their collections , but nothing quite of that magnitude .	the problem in this case , says state budget director adam horst , is that the traditional tools for catching mistakes would not necessarily have worked .	for instance , changing the " materiality " trigger would not have worked because the numbers being generated for the reports themselves were wrong , he said . "	that materiality threshold would not have changed their finding , " he said . "	if you do n't find it in the first place , whatever that number is ?	whether it 's 70 million , or 20 million or 10 million ?	is somewhat irrelevant . "	horst , however , has noted routinely throughout each budget debacle that the state 's internal safeguards did eventually kick in .	the person who started unraveling this whole thing upon discovering one small , but tangible error last november ?	an unnamed internal auditor .	still , it took three years before investigators found the first thread of this massive problem , and it took another few weeks after the initial discovery to determine there was a $ 320 million problem .	that $ 320 million problem , in turn , led state workers to discover the first traces of the $ 206 million error announced earlier this month .	the problems are n't likely to stop here .	horst says there are " indications " of more errors .	but he does n't want to jump the gun with any announcements before his internal " reconciliation " review is completed .
a new dan brown novel is coming in may , and the subject is dante .	doubleday announced tuesday that brown 's book is called " inferno , " named for dante 's epic journey in verse .	brown again will feature harvard symbologist robert langdon , the protagonist for his blockbuster " the da vinci code " and for the million-selling follow-up " the lost symbol . "	the new book might seem familiar in other ways , as brown again takes on a masterpiece of western civilization . "	the da vinci code " centered on an iconic painting , the mona lisa . "	although i studied dante 's ' inferno ' as a student , it was n't until recently , while researching in florence , that i came to appreciate the enduring influence of dante 's work on the modern world , " brown said in a statement . "	with this new novel , i am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm .	a landscape of codes , symbols , and more than a few secret passageways . "	brown may also be returning to the religious controversies of " the da vinci code , " when he infuriated some catholics by suggesting that jesus and mary magdalene had children .	dante himself was a catholic who was critical of church leaders .

when chris carver ran an ultra-marathon in scotland last year , which challenges athletes to run as far as possible within 24 hours , he ran 140 miles ( 225 kilometers ) .	determined to do better in this year 's race , carver added something extra to his training regime : beetroot juice .	for a week before the race , he drank the dark purple juice every day .	last month , carver won it by running 148 miles ( 238 kilometers ) . "	the only thing i did differently this year was the beetroot juice , " said carver , 46 , a professional runner based near leeds , in northern england .	he said more exercise would have improved his endurance , but to get the same result he attributes to the juice ?	an extra eight miles ?	it would likely have taken an entire year .	some experts say adding beetroot juice to your diet ?	like other foods such as cherry juice or milk ?	could provide a performance boost even beyond the blood , sweat and tears of more training .	in two studies conducted at exeter university on 15 men , stephen bailey and colleagues found cyclists who drank a half-liter ( about a half-quart ) of beetroot juice several hours before setting off were able to ride up to 20 percent longer than those who drank a placebo blackcurrant juice .	by examining the cyclists under a scanner that analyzes how much energy is needed for a muscle to contract , bailey and colleagues discovered beetroot juice allows cyclists to exercise using less oxygen than normal . "	the beetroot juice was effective even without any additional training , " bailey said . "	it reduces the energy requirements on your muscles so you can last longer . "	while the beetroot juice was provided free by its manufacturer , exeter university paid for the research .	bailey said the high nitrate content of beetroot juice is responsible for its athletic benefits .	scientists are n't exactly sure how it works , but suspect having more nitric oxide in your body , a byproduct of nitrate , helps you exercise with less oxygen .	bailey said the same effects might be possible if people ate more nitrate-rich foods like beetroot , lettuce or spinach .	bailey and colleagues calculated beetroot juice could translate into a 1 to 2 percent better race time , a tiny improvement likely only to matter to elite athletes .	they are still tweaking the dosage but say athletes should consume the juice a few hours before training so their body has time to digest it .	their latest study was published in june in the journal of applied physiology . "	drinking beetroot juice is not going to turn a recreational runner into an olympic champion , but it might make tolerating more exercise easier so you can train more , " said dr. andy franklyn-miller , a sports medicine expert at the centre for human performance in london .	he was not connected to the research and has not received any funding from beetroot juice makers .	franklyn-miller said since people often reach an athletic plateau where more training does n't help , beetroot juice could give you an extra edge you would n't get otherwise . "	it 's not banned , so there 's no reason not to try it , " he said .	still , he warned drinking too much of the juice could lead to side effects like abdominal cramps , diarrhea or purple urine .	previous studies in britain and the u.s. have found beetroot helps the heart by lowering blood pressure .	other experts warned manipulating your diet ca n't replace the benefits of training . "	certain foods can help you maximize the benefits from exercise , not reduce the amount you 're doing , " said roger fielding , director of the nutrition , exercise physiology and sarcopenia laboratory at tufts university .	he was not connected to any research on beetroot or any other nutritional supplements .	for serious athletes , fielding said changing your diet could help . "	if a very small improvement is valuable to you , it 's possible something like beetroot juice could do that , " he said .	other studies have shown drinking things like pickle juice or having a small carbohydrate snack during a marathon , can prevent cramps and improve performance .	scientists have also found cherry juice , which helps reduce exercise-induced swelling , could be strong enough to reduce some athletes ' use of anti-inflammatory pain medication .	fielding said the benefits of beetroot juice and other foods and drinks could have wider benefits and might one day be used to help elderly people with muscle weakness .	some elite athletes warned beetroot juice may not be to everybody 's taste . "	a few of my friends think it 's really disgusting , " said colin mccourt , 25 , a british runner competing at the commonwealth games in new delhi this month .	in april , mccourt started drinking cherry and beetroot juice , which he credits with helping him train longer and more often . "	i feel like i get a benefit from it , even if it 's minimal , " he told associated press television .	mccourt said he will continue to adjust his training regimen in preparation for the london 2012 olympics , but plans to maintain his juice habit . "	there will be a lot more beetroot juice if my stomach can take it . "

a lafayette veterans group has resumed its efforts to push the former our lady of lourdes hospital site to the u.s. department of veterans affairs as a way to fill the need for expanded health services for area veterans .	tom grote , co-chairman of the veterans action coalition , tells the advocate ( http://bit.ly/i9gy0i ) the federal agency could use the site as a medical complex and provide an array of services beyond primary and specialty health care , such as nursing home or assisted living care , recovery services , and mental and physical rehabilitation .	the regional veterans advocacy group organized two years ago to pitch a veterans hospital for the area with the lourdes hospital site as an ideal location .	the hospital moved its operations to south lafayette last year .	when the va set its goal of expanding the existing lafayette clinic with additional space and services , the coalition shifted its focus to identifying ideal clinic space and has lobbied for certain specialty services .	the group 's latest mission : fighting a six - to 12-month delay for a larger veterans health clinic with expanded specialty services in lafayette .	technical errors uncovered in the site selection paperwork for clinics in lafayette and lake charles prompted the need to restart both site selections , va officials have said .	the lourdes site is a " bargain " at $ 36 million compared with the more than $ 995 million budgeted for a new va medical center under construction in new orleans , grote said .	the coalition met monday with members voting to send a letter to va secretary eric shinseki urging him to consider the lourdes site .	the letter also requests that the va acquire the property via a single source procurement , which would allow the government to purchase the property directly , grote said .	grote told the group it will likely be another two years before a new clinic opens in lafayette because of the delay caused by the technical error in the site selection paperwork .
the case against a man accused of a deadly shooting rampage at los angeles international airport could face significant delays because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty .	the decision announced friday means that paul ciancia may not face a jury in 2015 , as a judge wants .	lawyers were expected to discuss a trial date monday during a hearing in u.s. district court .	prosecutors said in court papers that they would seek a death sentence because ciancia intentionally targeted federal employees and terrorized passengers and airport workers .	ciancia , 24 , has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in the killing of transportation security administration officer gerardo hernandez , 39 , and the wounding of three other people on nov. 1 , 2013 .	at a previous hearing , judge philip gutierrez said he wanted to hold the trial in 2015 .	but federal defender hilary potashner warned that her team may not be prepared because of the mountain of evidence turned over by prosecutors .	at the time , prosecutors said they had disclosed 10,000 pieces of evidence and 150 dvds of material and were still interviewing people in ciancia 's hometown of pennsville , new jersey .	death penalty cases are more complex because lawyers have to prepare for guilt and penalty phases and that often involves intensive digging for information from people who knew the defendant , even dating back to childhood .	lawyers are at the mercy of the judge and hope to be given the time to do the legwork , said attorney marilyn bednarski , a former federal defender not involved in the case . "	there 's often a serious psychiatric component to these cases , " said bednarski , who represented buford furrow , a white supremacist who killed a filipino postal worker and wounded five people in a 1999 shooting at a los angeles jewish community center . "	it 's just not normal behavior .	often people are terribly mentally ill and those things take a long time to investigate . "	federal death penalty cases are relatively rare .	u.s. prosecutors have sought the punishment about 500 times since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 , said richard dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center .	during that time , there were 79 death sentences , but only three people have been executed .

an infusion of money from microsoft corp. sent barnes & noble inc. 's stock zooming monday , as the software giant established a way to get back into the e-books business .	the two companies are teaming up to create a subsidiary for barnes & noble 's e-book and college textbook businesses , with microsoft paying $ 300 million for a minority stake .	shares of barnes & noble jumped $ 10.41 , or 76 percent , to $ 24.09 in morning trading .	the opening price of $ 26 was a three-year high .	microsoft 's stock rose 2 cents to $ 32 .	the deal gives barnes & noble ammunition to fend off shareholders who have agitated for a sale of the nook e-book business or the whole company , but the companies said monday that they are exploring separating the subsidiary , provisionally dubbed " newco , " entirely from barnes & noble .	that could mean a stock offering , sale or other deal .	the deal puts to rest concerns that barnes & noble does n't have the capital to compete in the e-book business with market leader amazon.com inc. and its kindle , said analyst david strasser at janney capital .	for microsoft , the investment means that it will own 17.6 percent in a company that sells tablet computers based on google inc. 's android , one of the main competitors of windows phone 7 , microsoft 's smartphone software .	microsoft also said the deal means that there will be a nook application for windows 8 tablets , set to be released this fall .	the app is likely to get a favored position on windows 8 screens .	there 's already a nook application for windows pcs , but none for windows phones .	william lynch , the ceo of barnes & noble , said nook software will continue to be available on devices like the iphone that compete with windows phone .	the nook has pleasantly surprised publishers , who worry about amazon.com 's domination of the e-market .	unveiled to skeptical reviews in 2009 , the nook is estimated to account for about 25 percent of the u.s. e-book market .	the nook helped to cut amazon 's share from what was believed to be 90 percent to around 60-65 percent .	david pogue in the new york times called the initial device " an anesthetized slug , " but praised the new nook simple touch as a " very big deal " that offers " spectacular , crisp pages to read in any light . "	barnes & noble investors have also been concerned about the recent government lawsuit against apple and some leading publishers over alleged price fixing .	when apple launched its ipad in 2010 , simon & schuster , penguin group ( usa ) and other publishers switched to an " agency " model that allowed publishers to set prices for e-books , a system many believe helped barnes & noble .	amazon.com had been offering top-selling e-books for $ 9.99 , a cost publishers , agents and writers believed was so low it could drive competitors out of business .	three of the five publishers sued ?	simon & schuster , harpercollins and the hachette book group ?	have already agreed to settle , meaning prices for their e-books likely will again drop on amazon .	microsoft has a long-standing interest in the e-book field .	it launched e-book software in 2000 , but was never able to build a substantial library of books .	it 's discontinuing the software on aug. 30 .	barnes & noble , based in new york , currently runs 691 bookstores in 50 states .	the companies said that the subsidiary will have an ongoing relationship with barnes & noble 's retail stores , but what that relationship will be is unclear . "	the whole reason the nook business is expanding so rapidly is because bookstores are committed to it and know how to market the product in that environment , " said michael norris , an analyst at simba information .	the possibility of a separation of barnes & noble 's digital and college businesses has been brewing .	in january , barnes & noble said it was considering options for its nook business , including possibly spinning it off or expanding overseas , and said it expected the review to be complete by the end of the year .	and in march , private investment firm g asset management , a barnes & noble shareholder , offered $ 460 million for a 51 percent stake in the company 's college bookstore unit , barnes & noble college booksellers llc .	under that plan , the college bookstore unit was proposed to begin as a private business but become public within a " reasonable " amount of time .	g asset 's offer was contingent upon barnes & noble keeping current management in place and separating its nook e-business from the rest of the company .	at the time the offer was made , barnes & noble declined to comment .	in 2009 , barnes & noble inc. bought the college bookstore unit from chairman leonard riggio in a deal worth $ 596 million .	the deal ended up costing barnes & noble $ 460 million after accounting for the unit 's cash on hand at the closing date .

smallpox , one of the world 's deadliest diseases , eradicated three decades ago , is kept alive under tight security today in just two places ?	the united states and russia .	many other countries say the world would be safer if those stockpiles of the virus were destroyed .	now for the fifth time , at a world health organization meeting next week , they will push again for the virus ' destruction .	and again it seems likely their efforts will be futile .	u.s. and russian government officials say it is essential they keep some smallpox alive in case a future biological threat demands more tests with the virus .	they also say the virus samples are still needed to develop experimental vaccines and drugs .	it was in 1996 that who 's member countries first agreed smallpox should be destroyed .	but they have repeatedly delayed a demand for destruction so that scientists could develop safer smallpox vaccines and drugs .	that 's now been done : there are two vaccines , a third in the works , and there are drugs for treating it , but not curing it .	yet even if most of who 's member countries vote to set a new date for destruction , the agency does n't have the power to enforce the decision .	the scientific community remains divided over whether the smallpox samples should be destroyed .	the respected journal nature editorialized against it earlier this year , arguing that scientists need the ability to do further research , and perhaps develop new vaccines and treatments in an era of possible biological attack .	however , one of the most prominent figures in wiping out the deadly , disfiguring disease is in favor of destroying all remnants of it . "	it would be an excellent idea to destroy the smallpox viruses , " said dr. donald a. henderson , who led who 's eradication effort in the 1970s . "	this is an organism to be greatly feared . "	he says possession of smallpox by those not authorized to have it should be made a crime against humanity and that international authorities should prosecute any country found with it .	a report by independent researchers commissioned by who last year concluded there was no compelling scientific reason to hang onto the viruses .	yet other scientists contend the stockpiles could still provide valuable information in the future .	smallpox is one of the most lethal diseases in history .	for centuries , it killed about one-third of the people it infected , including queen mary ii of england , and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the hideous pus-filled lesions .	the last known case was in britain in 1978 when a university photographer who worked above a lab handling smallpox died after being accidentally exposed to it from the building 's air duct system .	smallpox vaccines are made from vaccinia , a milder related virus . "	we have many ways of looking at smallpox , including gene mapping , that means we do n't need the actual ( smallpox ) virus , " said henderson , who is now with the center for biosecurity at the university of pittsburgh medical center .	american and russian officials disagree .	dr. nils daulaire , director of the u.s. department of health and human services ' office of global affairs , said the u.s. will again ask who to postpone a decision calling for the stockpile 's destruction .	he said u.s. scientists need more time to finish research into how well new vaccines and drugs work against the virus .	but he acknowledged u.s. officials also want their own supply in case terrorists unleash smallpox as a biological weapon and additional study is needed .	a scientist at the russian laboratory where smallpox is kept , who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the press , said the virus should be kept in case similar ones pop up in the future and more studies are needed .	meanwhile , officials from developing countries are anxious to close the last chapter on the disease . "	there is a consensus to destroy the viruses , so how come we 're in this situation where we 're pandering to the u.s. and russia ? "	asked lim li ching , a biosafety expert at third world network , a group that lobbies on behalf of developing countries .	oyewale tomori , a virology professor at redeemer 's university in nigeria , said most african countries want smallpox destroyed .	tomori also sits on a who advisory committee on smallpox . "	africa is one part of the world where a biological attack with smallpox is likely to have a more devastating effect , " he said .	keiji fukuda , who 's assistant director-general for health security and the environment , said the agency remains concerned about the possibility of smallpox 's return . "	the chance of an outbreak is reasonably low , but not zero , " he said .	with the new vaccines and drugs , fukuda was optimistic any smallpox outbreak would be stamped out relatively quickly though acknowledged any new cases might spark global alarm . "	if smallpox were to reappear , we would be in a much better situation than in the past , considering the vaccine supplies and strategies that have been demonstrated to work , " he said .	he guessed that stamping out a smallpox outbreak would be faster than the four months it took to mostly end the 2003 global outbreak of sars , where doctors could only isolate patients and trace suspect cases .	with smallpox , fukuda said countries could quickly vaccinate people in surrounding areas and that drugs could be sent to treat patients .	fukuda said many rich countries like the u.s. have their own smallpox vaccine stockpiles .	who also has at least 30 million doses for poor countries in case the virus re-emerges , but that supply uses older vaccines that can trigger aids in people who have hiv .	david evans , a smallpox expert at the university of alberta , who was part of the who team that inspected the u.s. and russian labs holding smallpox several years ago , says he doubts the virus could escape from either facility .	the viruses are kept at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta and the state research center of virology and biotechnology in novosibirsk , siberia .	laboratories where smallpox is kept have the highest possible containment measures .	scientists who work with the virus use fingerprint or retinal scans to get inside , wear a full-body suit including gloves and goggles , and shower with strong disinfectant before leaving the lab and taking off the suit .	the u.s. smallpox viruses , which include samples from britain , japan and the netherlands , are stored in liquid nitrogen .	rumors about stockpiles in countries like iraq and north korea have never been proven , and evans said it would be too difficult to experiment with smallpox and keep it a secret . "	the nations i would worry about , weird places run by odd dictators , they 're just not capable of doing this stuff , " he said .	evans thinks it 's unlikely terrorists would resort to smallpox in a biological attack . "	if you want to disrupt countries , there are lots of easier ways to do it than to experiment with something so dangerous , " he said .

russian prime minister vladimir putin on thursday agreed to support a $ 1 billion ( euro810 million ) u.s.-russian joint venture to drill for oil in the black sea , saying he was assured it would be environmentally sound .	referring to the disaster in the gulf of mexico , putin said russia 's government should support efforts by u.s.-based chevron and russia 's state-owned rosneft to explore for crude in the black sea as long as the two companies employ the highest standards . "	i 'm proceeding from the basis that ( chevron 's ) plans with rosneft will be executed on the highest level , adhering to all ecological standards , " putin told chevron ceo john watson .	watson assured putin that chevron intended to strengthen its ecological standards in light of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico .	chevron and rosneft signed an agreement thursday at putin 's suburban moscow residence .	according to the deal , the companies will develop the val shatsky deposit off russia 's black sea coast , which could contain up to 860 million tons of crude , according to rosneft , russia 's largest oil company .	rosneft ceo sergei bogdanchikov said drilling would start at two sites ?	one approximately 120 miles ( 200 kilometers ) from the port city of novorossiisk , and the other further south off the shore of tuapse .	the first drilling should begin by the end of 2011 .	the black sea is shared by six countries ?	russia , ukraine , romania , bulgaria , turkey and georgia ?	and considered to be particularly ecologically vulnerable due to the low level of fresh water inflow .	last week bulgarian prime minister boiko borisov said bulgaria would withdraw from a russia-backed pipeline project to deliver oil to southeastern europe due to oil spill fears .	borisov said the project ?	known as south stream ?	was meeting resistance from residents of the black sea town of burgas , where the pipeline was due to start still , to some extent all six black sea countries are clamoring to tap the seabed for petroleum , and rosneft data indicates that there are 180 drill sites in the area .	faced with the enormous challenges of drilling in the black sea , russia decided to attract a foreign investor and eventually decided upon chevron , deputy prime minister igor sechin said .	sechin said that $ 1 billion would be invested in initial exploration and that total investments could reach up to 1 trillion rubles ( $ 33 billion ) if the project is successful .	rosneft shares were down nearly 6 percent thursday on rumors that bp ?	which owns 1.3 percent of rosneft ?	might sell its share in the russian company .	bogdanchikov expressed confidence that rosneft would not suffer if bp were to cease being a shareholder .

airline passengers can expect fewer carriers to choose from , fewer flights to smaller cities and more baggage and other fees as the industry continues to grapple with high fuel prices and a weak economy , according to a government report released tuesday .	the u.s. airline industry is still in transition after a tumultuous decade in which bankruptcies and mergers cut the number of airlines accounting for the bulk of domestic flights in half , to just five : american , delta , southwest , united and us airways , the report by the department of transportation 's inspector general said .	if us airways and american ?	which are in merger discussions ?	were to combine , that would drop to four .	there are dozens of other airlines in the u.s. , but collectively those smaller carriers account for less than 15 percent of total passenger traffic .	twelve years ago , there were ten major u.s. airlines accounting for 90 percent of domestic flights .	but high fuel prices , the 2008 recession and a slow economic recovery have taken a toll , the report said .	in 2000 , fuel costs were just 10 percent of airline operating expenses .	fuel costs peaked at 40 percent of expenses in 2008 , outdistancing payroll as the airlines ' biggest expense .	last year , fuel accounted for 35 percent of expenses .	less competition has enabled airlines to try to offset higher costs by eliminating less profitable flights to smaller cities , the report said .	airlines cut the number of scheduled domestic flights by 14 percent between june 2007 and june 2012 , the report said .	as a result , flights have fewer empty seats and airlines have been able to increase fares , especially on short-haul flights .	last year , the industry attempted 22 fare increases , of which 11 were successful , the report said .	airfare increases are considered successful if competitors also adopt an increase .	if there 's not widespread matching by other airlines , the result is usually a withdrawal of the original increase .	so far this year airlines have attempted eight fare increases , four of which have been successful , the report said .	since 2008 , airlines have also supplemented their fares by charging a wide range of fees for services that in most cases used to be free .	baggage fees alone contributed $ 2.7 billion in added revenue to airlines last year .	besides fees for checked bags , at least two airlines ?	allegiant and spirit ?	now charge passengers for carry-on bags .	as a result of these trends , the industry in general has become profitable again after years of red ink .	and having fewer flights has resulted in a drop in flight delays and cancellations . "	the good news is that the ( carrier ) consolidation and ancillary fee revenue stream have stabilized the airline industry , " said kevin mitchell , chairman of the business travel coalition , which represents corporate travel managers . "	the bad news is airlines can disregard consumers ' interests much more easily when there are fewer carriers . "	john heimlich , vice president and chief economist for airlines for america , a trade association representing major airlines , said one reason airlines have cut back on flights is that more passengers traveling less than 700 miles are choosing other forms of transportation such as cut-rate intercity buses and amtrak 's higher-speed acela trains in the northeast .	he said some people would also rather drive than hassle with security checks in the post-9 / 11 world . "	airlines have been more cautious about avoiding a glut of seats in the marketplace relative to the demand , and such caution has helped the industry get back on more solid financial footing , " heimlich said .

a few years ago in this mist-shrouded mountain town , steep slopes were quilted with some of the world 's most valuable coffee trees .	farmers scrambled to increase acreage and pickers painstakingly filled wooden boxes with ripened berries at harvest time .	today , much of the terrain is overgrown with underbrush and bamboo as a declining luxury market in japan and a voracious beetle drive thousands of frustrated small farmers away from tiny plots of leased highlands .	times are hard for the growers of jamaica 's legendary coffee , especially those on isolated , low-tech farms such as the ones in brandon hill , a one-road enclave with no traffic lights . "	we used to make a living , but now we 're working hungry , " said colin mclaren , standing in his sloping farm of flowering coffee trees in jamaica 's wild eastern mountains , where his father grew the gourmet arabica beans before him . "	it 's tough and getting tougher . "	jamaica produces what connoisseurs rank as one of the world 's finest coffees , mostly grown on patches of a few acres between 2,000 to 5,000 feet ( 610 to 1,525 meters ) above sea level .	the moist , cool climate of the blue mountains lengthens the growing period from five to about 10 months , allowing sugars to develop in the beans that grow inside the berries .	many coffee lovers say the rich brew has a smooth , nutty flavor and a deep , intriguing aftertaste .	the roasted beans often sell for about $ 40 a pound in the united states , up to four times the price of other gourmet coffees .	in japan , the main market for blue mountain coffee , the beans fetch as much as $ 34 for a 100-gram ( 3.5-ounce ) package .	but consumers are buying less because of the global economic slump .	and that has brought declines in purchases by coffee dealers , as well as big drops in the prices paid to jamaica 's growers .	like farmers everywhere , they get only a small fraction of the retail price after middlemen , processors , shippers , retailers and others take their slices of the pie .	meanwhile , the cost of producing coffee has soared for jamaicans as inflation has driven prices for fertilizer , insecticide and wages higher over the last decade and powerful storms damaged their trees .	between 2005 and 2009 , the cost of tending an acre of coffee almost doubled , jumping from $ 3,400 to $ 7,070 .	an increasing number of exasperated jamaican farmers say they ca n't even eke out a bare living growing the specialty crop .	the nation 's coffee industry board says jamaican farmers received an average of $ 50.57 for every 60-pound ( 27-kilogram ) box of blue mountain coffee cherries they produced during the 2006-2007 season .	last year , they got $ 28.91 .	over the same period , the price of coffee elsewhere roughly doubled , according to the world coffee organization , as consumer demand has risen for mostly inexpensive commodity beans .	mclaren said the problem has gotten so bad that he would accept being paid in fertilizer instead of cash just so he can keep his coffee farm healthy and maintain his investment . "	that 's what it 's come to now , " he said , looking over his mountainside farm from a ledge . "	fertilizer here costs more than a box of our coffee . "	demand for the island 's coffee has plunged in japan , where coffee lovers have long paid top dollar for jamaican beans .	japan used to buy nearly 90 percent of jamaica 's crop and helped the island develop its brand .	now japanese importers buy around 60 percent at depreciated prices and have stopped advance payments for green coffee , shifting the costs to jamaican exporters .	toyohide nishino , executive director of the all japan coffee association , said his country 's love affair with blue mountain coffee has dulled because even discriminating japanese consumers are looking for cheaper products at a time of economic stagnation . "	consumers really have to watch their budgets , and blue mountain coffee is an expensive brand , " nishino said . "	so instead of blue mountain , coffee from colombia and brazil is more popular these days . "	this year , jamaica is projected to produce just 140,000 60-pound ( 27-kilogram ) boxes of branded blue mountain coffee , far below the record crop of 529,704 boxes in 2003 .	even in 2004 , when jamaica 's coffee business was ravaged by category 4 hurricane ivan , it managed to produce 236,405 boxes of blue mountain coffee .	as some farmers gave up in the lush blue mountains that tower over eastern jamaica , their untended fields exacerbated a problem for those who remained by creating a breeding ground for the coffee berry borer , an invasive pest originally from central africa that is a headache for coffee growers around the world .	officials say some jamaican farmers could lose as much as half of their coffee crop this year due to the borer , an opportunistic bug smaller than a sesame seed that flourishes in abandoned fields and then spreads to working farms , further diminishing supply .	industry leaders are distributing about 50,000 sticky traps containing a dab of pheromone that lures the tiny beetles inside , and they 're trying to educate farmers about how to get rid of the pests by hand .	the government , meanwhile , is distributing small aid payments to help with fertilizer purchases .	gusland mccook , advisory officer with jamaica 's coffee industry board , said the island has to get the borer population down or else its " going to be catastrophic . "	and the fall in prices for blue mountain beans makes that tougher . "	a true , faithful coffee farmer can deal with the borer , ( and ) with more storms .	but if the big man makes it so he ca n't make a living , well , that 's another story , " said danavan edwards , a 29-year-old farmer with a plot near mclaren 's land .	derrick simon , president of the all island jamaica coffee growers ' association , argues that the industry is in trouble largely because it foolishly relied on japan almost exclusively for years and failed to diversify its markets .	mccook agrees that jamaica needs to push into new markets . "	i do n't believe we should be looking back with much regret , but we should have been looking forward in a better way .	you could say we have been slow to react and look forward and make adjustments . "	jamaica has been trying to expand the market for blue mountain coffee in europe and the u.s. , where adventurous coffee lovers can order it online from several sellers .	the coffee industry board also is looking for a toehold in china , where analysts predict coffee consumption will grow .	prices have edged back up , although they 're still far below what growers used to get .	mavis bank coffee factory ltd. , a major jamaican processor and exporter , just promised growers a final price of $ 35.75 for each box they produce .	not all jamaican growers face the same hardships .	farmers with a do-it-yourself approach at higher , cooler elevations find they do n't need to spray often for the damaging beetle , which is far more common at lower altitudes .	david twyman of the old tavern coffee estate brand cultivates and roasts coffee at his family 's 150-acre property and relies largely on mail order customers in the u.s. , canada and taiwan who come back year after year . "	we 've found that once we get people to try our coffee , they will be back , " twyman said at his lush farm perched high in the mountains perch where he gives tours and steaming cups of black coffee to tourists and other visitors . "	our customers want a more personal connection . "

the stock market began august with a huge rally after economic reports from around the world revived investors ' faith in the global recovery .	the dow jones industrial average rose 208 points monday .	all the major stock indexes rose about 2 percent .	the first day of the month brought a stream of news that reassured investors who have worried about a slowing of economic growth in the u.s. , china and europe .	manufacturing was a common thread : ?	the institute for supply management 's index of u.s. manufacturing activity during july was better than the market expected .	traders were pleased because the report still showed that manufacturing is growing . ?	a manufacturing report for the 16 countries that use the euro was revised higher for july and showed that the european economy is recovering faster than expected .	strong earnings reports from european banks also reassured the market , especially after the continent 's rising debt problems helped trigger a spring plunge in stocks . ?	from china came news that industrial growth was moderate enough that beijing is n't likely to take steps to slow that country 's economy .	investors have periodically sold stocks on concerns that china 's economy would slow and pull others down with it .	monday 's news was encouraging after months of reports showing the recovery was weakening contributed to sharp swings in stock prices .	strong earnings in july helped drive stocks to their best month in a year , but the rally was fading at the end of the month on new worries about the economy .	the ism report is significant because it is the first major reading of the economy from july and investors are trying to determine just how strong the recovery will be in the second half of the year .	monday 's big advance was a bit of a surprise for traders who are used to more subdued trading as august arrives .	over the past 12 years , the dow has fallen nine times on the first trading day in august , although it has risen the past three years .	august in general is seen as a volatile month for stocks , largely because many traders are away on vacation .	that makes for low trading volumes and exaggerated price moves .	some analysts were cautious even as stock prices jumped . "	the market move at the margin is all about incremental news , and the incremental news today was better , " said alan gayle , senior investment strategist for ridgeworth investments in richmond , virginia . "	fundamentally , i do believe the pace of the ( economic ) expansion is slowing and i think that 's going to weigh on the markets as we go through the second half of the year . "	the dow jones industrial average rose 208.44 , or 2 percent , to 10,674.38 .	the standard & poor 's 500 index rose 24.26 , or 2.2 percent , to 1,125.86 , while the nasdaq composite index rose 40.66 , or 1.8 percent , to 2,295.36 .	six stocks rose for every one that fell on the new york stock exchange where volume came to a light 1 billion shares .	with stocks rising sharply , bond prices fell .	the yield on the 10-year treasury note , which moves opposite its price , rose to 2.97 percent from 2.91 percent late friday .	its yield is often used as a benchmark to set interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans .
a crowd of family members , longtime friends and politicians turned out saturday morning to pay their final respects as house speaker ben lujan , one of the most powerful and longest serving state legislators in new mexico history , was laid to rest .	a funeral mass drew about 1,000 people to the cathedral basilica of st. francis of assisi in santa fe .	among them were former gov. toney anaya , attorney general gary king and albuquerque mayor richard berry .	lujan 's son , u.s. rep. ben ray lujan , described his father as a " gentleman 's gentleman " during saturday 's service .	he said his father knew how to bring people together but was also known for standing his ground . "	he fought for the poor and those that were less fortunate , " congressman lujan said .	archbishop michael sheehan described ben lujan as a skilled politician , a devout catholic and a family man .	lujan died of lung cancer shortly before christmas .	he was 77 .	he was diagnosed with advanced stage cancer in late 2009 and had undergone radiation and chemotherapy treatment .	it was n't until the opening of the 2012 legislative session that he publicly announced his battle with the illness and his planned retirement .	the democrat from nambe spent half his life as a state lawmaker , winning his first election to the house in 1974 .	lujan served as speaker from 2001 to 2012 .	he was one of the most influential men in the legislature and was known for his keen knowledge of legislative rules and procedures in steering bills through the house or keeping measures bottled up in committees .	at the end of his final legislative session , which coincided with new mexico 's statehood centennial , lujan told his colleagues : " i leave you as you begin your journey to the next 100 years .	i trust you to be great stewards of this land of enchantment .	it 's truly a remarkable participatory process . "	lujan 's family said he loved new mexico and its people .	he championed legislation to cap property tax increases , finance highway projects and a worker training subsidy program that was one of the state 's main economic development incentives .	he was also instrumental in removing the tax on food in 2004 .	for lujan , that was one of his proudest accomplishments .	following saturday 's funeral mass , lujan was to be buried at sagrado corazon de jesus cemetery in nambe .	his family asked that in lieu of flowers , memorial contributions be made to the university of new mexico cancer center or to the speaker ben lujan scholarship memorial fund at any century bank branch .

"	said ig chief strategist chris weston .

lobbyists spent about a third less money on georgia 's state senators in the month after the chamber imposed limits , though it remains unclear whether the new rule alone can be credited for the change .	an analysis of spending by the associated press shows that lobbyists spent more than $ 91,300 on senate lawmakers in the one-month period after the senate passed its rule on jan. 14 , a decrease of roughly 35 percent compared with the same period last year .	the spending tally includes lobbyist expenditures on individual state senators , groups of senators and events open to all lawmakers in the general assembly .	the new senate rule , adopted the first day of the session , generally prohibits state senators from accepting lobbyist gifts worth more than $ 100 , though it leaves exceptions .	the ap 's review showed that the number of lobbyist expenditures worth more than $ 100 in the senate dropped to 86 during the first month of the session , down from a total of 153 during the same period last year .	spending tallies derived from lobbyist reports should be viewed as broad indicators , not exact sums .	lobbyists self-report their spending , and reports are rarely audited for accuracy .	mistakes in the reports or variations in the spelling of a politician 's name or title can throw off automated calculations .	despite those limitations , the math shows that spending is down .	state sen. joshua mckoon , r-columbus , called the new rule " the no. 1 driving force " in the drop in spending . "	certainly i think the passage of the rule is contributing to an overall change of culture , which is really what we 're after , " said mckoon , a leading proponent of limiting lobbyist spending .	other factors may be at work , too , including public attitude .	last summer , roughly 81 percent of georgia voters voted in favor of limiting lobbyist expenditures in nonbinding questions on the republican and democratic primary election ballots .	also last year , sen. don balfour , r-snellville , was fined $ 5,000 for illegally accepting pay for in-state official work and travel on some days when lobbyists reported wining and dining him out of state .	house speaker david ralston , r-blue ridge , ran into criticism after a lobbyist paid $ 17,000 in 2010 to take him , his family and two others on a trip to europe .	both balfour and ralston won re-election .	ralston , who criticizes the senate prohibitions as weak , has proposed his own prohibition on lobbyist spending on individual lawmakers .	his plan , too , has exceptions to the basic rule . "	more and more you 're seeing those who are either reducing or not accepting gifts , and it 's had an effect on the behavior of the lobbyists , " said william perry , executive director of common cause georgia , one of several organizations backing limits on lobbyist spending .	no senator appears to have violated the new senate rule in the month since it took effect .	but several received gifts just before the tighter limits took hold .	the university system of georgia reported on jan. 1 spending $ 1,365 to send sen. frank ginn to the capitol one bowl in orlando , fla. .	ginn said he refunded the money after the senate passed its new rule .	the day before the senate rule took effect , sen. tyler harper accepted a $ 158 ticket to a falcons game , according to lobbyist reports .	harper said he had intended to pay for the ticket and reimbursed the sponsor after the game .	lobbyists can still get around the rule .	they can pay as much as they want to send senators on junkets if the events are tied to a lawmaker 's official duties .	and the $ 100 limit does not apply to events where all state lawmakers or members of committees or caucuses are invited .	for example , a lobbyist for the wine and spirits wholesalers of georgia reported paying roughly $ 370 as part of a dinner for the senate regulated industries and utilities committee .	a lack of detail on the lobbyist reports makes it difficult to verify whether the new rules are strictly observed .	mercer university paid nearly $ 900 as part of annual meal for senate leaders , though it did not list how many lawmakers were there .	mercer spokesman larry brumley said about 20 people attended the meal , though he did not have an exact count . "	i would doubt very seriously if there was any danger of anyone going anywhere near that limit , " he said of the $ 100 per-legislator cap .
the state transportation director says an internal audit of supervisory changes over the past two years found a dozen instances in which the person who was hired or promoted did n't meet the minimum hiring qualifications for the jobs .	director tim reardon told lawmakers thursday he began the audit after a legislative audit reviewed five employment files and found three hires did n't meet the minimum qualifications .	reardon says two are performing their jobs well while a third appears to be struggling .	lee newspapers of montana reports that seven of the 12 employees the internal review noted did n't have the supervisory or other experience needed , but six have now met that requirement .	reardon says two others have been placed in training assignment jobs and will be evaluated when those assignments end .
idaho tourism officials say revenue generated during the summer of 2010 shows the industry is rebounding after a two-year slump blamed on the economic downturn .	tourism related revenue increased nearly nine percent during the 2010 summer months of june , july and august compared to the same three-month period a year ago , according to the idaho division of tourism . "	we are definitely rebounding , " karen ballard , administrator of the idaho division of tourism , told the idaho business review . "	we 're going to be the first industry out of the recession that shows signs of life . "	like many industries , tourism activity and revenue declined the last two years as people cut back spending on vacation travel , hotels and amusement activities .	the agency reports revenue and tourism taxes dropped 12 percent from 2008 to 2009 .	in idaho 's economy , tourism accounts for an estimated 5 percent of the state 's gross state product , according to the idaho tax commission .	the state saw record-high tourism receipts of $ 406.7 million in 2008 , but those totals fell to $ 358 million in 2009 .	for business owners who rely on tourism dollars , the decline meant fewer hotel reservations , a drop in apparel sales and fewer people and families dining out . "	we saw a decrease in people buying logo wear , in clothing , things like that , " said tom chasse , the president and chief executive officer at schweitzer mountain resort in northern idaho . "	people opted out of things . "	but chasse said sales increased this summer , and the resort had its busiest weekend ever at its annual fall festival in september .	ballard says the rebound is probably tied to idaho residents and those in neighboring states who are still dealing with the recession opting for smaller scale vacations . "	vacation is still important and they 're just taking a more reasonable one , " she said . "	instead of going to europe , they 're going to yellowstone , and instead of disneyland they 're going to silverwood , " a theme park 15 miles north of coeur d'alene .
house speaker bobby harrell said thursday he expects south carolina to be sued over a panel 's decision to disregard the state budget and increase employees ' health insurance costs anyway .	and he expects the state to lose .	harrell , r-charleston , said the budget and control board likely lacked the authority to split the cost of premium hikes between workers and employers after the legislature passed a budget that fully funded the increases . "	i 'm not angry , just frustrated by the action , " he said , adding that defending an expected class-action lawsuit will just cost the state more money .	gov. nikki haley , chairman of the five-member board , convinced a majority on wednesday to buck the budget in approving rates to take effect jan. 1 .	it 's believed to be an unprecedented override for what has previously been a procedural vote .	state law requires the board 's approval by mid-august to prepare for open enrollment in october , when employees can make changes to their health plans for the coming year .	the 3-2 vote means rates will increase 4.6 percent for both workers ?	past and present ?	and employers , which include state agencies , school districts and public colleges .	the state health plan covers 415,310 residents : public employees , retirees and their spouses and children .	it would mark the second consecutive year of split increases .	last january , rates increased 4.5 percent for both employers and workers ?	employees ' first increase in years .	agencies ' contributions increased by 10 percent in both 2008 and 2011 .	if the board had followed the budget , bearing the full cost would have cost employers 6.4 percent more starting jan. 1 .	the budget distributed the necessary $ 20.6 million to agencies and schools to cover that , but the vote means only $ 14.8 million of that is needed .	haley said that surplus should sit in state coffers to become part of 2013-14 budget decisions .	senate president pro tem john courson , r-columbia , was among senators thursday calling on the board to reconvene and reverse what they called a violation of the law .	but haley 's office made clear she wo n't reconsider . "	all we are asking for is fairness ?	a shared expense by state employees and taxpayers , " haley spokesman rob godfrey said . "	we will always fight for state employees , but we believe they 'll understand that it 's not right for the taxpayers to pick up the increased cost of their health insurance . "	democratic sens. darrell jackson and joel lourie , both from columbia , said haley 's move amounts to a back-door veto .	they noted haley could have used her line-item veto power as part of the budget process , but she did n't touch that issue .	legislators agreed in the 2012-13 budget to fully fund the premium hikes to ensure workers noticed an increase in their take-home pay following four years without a raise .	the approved budget provided 3 percent raises for most state employees ?	5 percent for state law enforcement officers ?	while requiring , as part of a new pension reform law , that employees contribute an additional 1.5 percent of their salary toward their retirement .	covering health care increases was part of the larger compromise on worker pay . "	we felt it was interlocked , " courson said .	in her executive budget proposal , haley provided no raises to public workers and split the cost of the health care premium increases .	but when haley did n't veto those items in the legislature 's budget , courson said , " we assumed everything was fine . "	the board 's dissenting votes came from the panel 's two legislative leaders . "	i 'll never vote to undo what the general assembly did , " said senate finance chairman hugh leatherman , a board member . "	i think it 's mandated to be drawn down as the general assembly provided in the appropriation bill .	i do n't think we or anyone else has the authority to go behind the general assembly . "	haley repeatedly said wednesday that workers should have " some skin in the game . "	house minority leader harry ott said they do , after years with no raise , furloughs that reduced their salaries and layoffs that increased their workloads . "	she continues her total disregard for state workers and teachers , " said ott , d-st .	matthews .	he noted the move is not going to help the republican governor 's already contentious relationship with the republican-controlled legislature . "	she 's now clearly said i do n't care what the general assembly did .	i do n't care what 's in their budget .	i 'm going to undo it , " he said . "	at some point , she 's got to understand she 's the governor and not a candidate for some other office , and work with the general assembly . "	on average , agencies will pay an extra $ 19 monthly , while employees and retirees will pay $ 7 more .	specific amounts by plan are not yet determined .	currently , employees ' contributions for the standard health plan range from $ 98 monthly for a single , non-smoker to $ 367 monthly for full family coverage with a smoker in the household .	employers pay between $ 292 for single workers to $ 724 for full families .
the mosquito-borne west nile virus , which has been more deadly than ever this year in some parts of the country , has been linked to its first death of the year in new jersey .	health officials announced friday that a 77-year-old willingboro man died in his home sunday about two weeks after he developed fever , weakness , and respiratory illness that eventually led to his being hospitalized for a time .	burlington county spokesman ralph shrom said officials confirmed it was west nile on saturday , a day before his death .	authorities declined to provide the name of the patient in order to protect his family 's privacy .	his death was the first linked to west nile in new jersey since 2010 and one of 15 confirmed cases in 12 counties spanning every part of the state , except the northwest corner .	last year , there were seven confirmed cases in the state but no deaths .	in 2010 , there were 30 cases , including two deaths .	cases typically peak in late summer or early fall .	it 's been a bad year for the disease in other areas ?	and the worst ever in texas .	the centers for disease control said 1,993 cases nationwide have been reported to federal authorities this year ?	including more than 85 fatalities .	the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of serious health complications .	mosquitoes get the virus from feeding on infected birds and then spread the virus to people they bite .	symptoms for both forms of west nile can include headache , tiredness and fever .	those with the neuroinvasive form can also suffer from symptoms including coma , convulsions and paralysis .	health officials said that about one-fifth of the people infected with the virus develop symptoms .	new jersey 's department of environmental protection is increasing the amount of funding for testing mosquitoes for the virus .	officials say people should limit their exposure to the bugs my making sure screen doors and windows do not have holes , using insect netting on infant carriers and strollers , staying indoors and dusk and dawn and making sure there is no standing water on their properties .	mosquitoes can be hatched in any puddle that stands for four days or more .
an appellate court has ordered the reinstatement of anti-paparazzi charges against a photographer accused of engaging in a high speed chase of justin bieber in 2012 .	a three-judge los angeles superior court panel ordered friday that two counts of a law aimed at curbing aggressive driving by the paparazzi be reinstated against celebrity photographer paul raef .	raef was also charged with traditional reckless driving charges after the july 2012 chase on a los angeles freeway that topped 80 mph and prompted several 911 calls .	the case had been put on hold while los angeles prosecutors appealed the dismissal of the anti-paparazzi counts .	he has not yet entered a plea to any of the counts .	raef is the first photographer to be charged under the 2010 law , but his attorneys successfully got the anti-paparazzi counts dismissed in november 2012 by arguing that the statute was unconstitutional .	superior court judge thomas rubinson agreed , stating at the time that the anti-paparazzi law could be applied to photographers rushing to shoot a wedding or a political rally , or even private citizens on their way to an event that might generate photos worth selling .	the judges had previously indicated that they believed the law was constitutional .	their full opinion on the case was not available wednesday .	the anti-paparazzi law was inspired in part by the experience of jennifer aniston , who told a lawmaker about being unable to drive away after being surrounded by paparazzi on pacific coast highway .	the law raised the penalty for those who drive dangerously in pursuit of photos for commercial gain .	the offense is punishable by six months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine but went unused until the pursuit of bieber , which resulted in the singer receiving a speeding citation .
panelists invited by a freshman north dakota congressman to discuss gun violence were divided on their opinions friday , but the majority of audience members said they want the federal government to stay out of the gun business .	rep. kevin cramer said fellow washington lawmakers warned him about inviting a fight he did n't need , but he acknowledged that the debate over gun rights is not difficult to win in a pro-gun , low-crime state where all three congressional delegates have advocated for gun rights . "	there is nothing common sense coming forward about these proposals to further restrict our gun rights , " fargo resident steve owens said . "	so let 's get the guns ?	no .	let 's get the criminals . "	gun violence and murders are rare in north dakota , although they did increase in the last two years recorded .	according to fbi statistics , the state had 10 murders or non-negligent homicides in 2010 .	the number ballooned to 24 in 2011 . "	the idea that somehow washington can come in and have a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that does n't exist everywhere is probably folly , " cramer said afterward . "	i believe that anyway , but it certainly was confirmed today . "	lillian jones , of fargo , said she 's worried about an increase of crime because of the influx of workers to the oil patch of western north dakota and her hometown area on the fort berthold indian reservation . "	you take into consideration the man camps , the gun-loving americans .	they 're there , " jones said . "	the number of threats being experienced by native women in that area is off the charts . "	paul conlin , of fargo , said he would abide by any gun laws passed by congress , but would refuse to give the same respect to an executive order by the president . "	an executive order is no more a law than me standing in my garage makes me a '57 chevy , " he said .	the panel at friday 's event included representatives from education , police , mental health and clergy .	susan beehler , one of the panelists , is the north dakota chapter leader of a group originally known as one million moms for gun control .	she 's promoting the obama administration 's proposals for universal background checks for gun owners , a ban on many military-style weapons and a limit on the size of magazines . "	american families continue to be destroyed by this gun violence , " beehler said . "	as mothers we have had enough . "	cramer said any ban on a weapon is not going to happen and there 's not an appetite in congress to restrict magazines .	but he said friday 's discussion was important for him to hear all sides . "	the one issue that might have some common ground is the move toward universal background checks , or at least more of a background check , " cramer said . "	the problem with it is , we could solve some of that with better enforcement of existing laws . "
washington public school students are doing about as well on state tests as they have done over the past few years .	but many more schools in washington state are failing to make adequate yearly progress , according to federal education rules .	during a news conference on wednesday , superintendent of public instruction randy dorn called those federal requirements crazy .	he said it was n't fair that washington schools have to pay the price for rules that should be changed by congress .	more than 1,900 schools out of about 2,200 in washington are labeled as failing in 2014 .	but there also was some good news in dorn 's report : more than 90 percent of the students in the class of 2014 passed the tests they needed to graduate .
lindsay lohan 's stay in the los angeles county jail will be significantly shortened by jail overcrowding .	a judge sentenced her wednesday to 30 days in jail after she acknowledged she recently violated court orders by getting booted from a community service assignment at a women 's shelter .	sheriff 's officials say lohan may be at the jail for only a few hours .	the actual length of the term will be set by the sheriff 's department , which oversees county lockups .	the 25-year-old actress has until nov. 9 to report for her jail term , and superior court judge stephanie sautner ruled she can not serve house arrest , as she did previously this year .	the sentence also requires lohan to perform community service assignments at the county morgue , undergo psychotherapy sessions , and appear monthly at court hearings through march .
a judge has denied the use of a still camera during a trial in what might be the first attempt to use south dakota 's new rules for cameras in the courtroom .	kokk radio reports that judge david gienapp ( gee ' - nap ) rejected the station 's request for a camera for the trial of a high school student accused of making threats on facebook .	gienapp is to rule next week on the use of an audio recorder .	if one is allowed , it will happen only if the trial that begins june 29 lasts until july 1 , the day the new rules take effect .	the rules approved by the state supreme court allow cameras in a courtroom if a judge and all parties agree .	gienapp said that did n't happen in the melissa kruger case .
an ohio transportation agency is developing a plan for special buses to carry riders among the hottest spots in downtown columbus .	the central ohio transit authority envisions stops that include the trendy arena district , the historic and picturesque german village and the artsy short north neighborhood .	specially branded buses would run between those areas on a faster schedule than other bus lines at reduced fairs or for free .	agency officials say they 're targeting may 2014 as a possible launch date .	the columbus dispatch reports ( http://bit.ly/17b9zya ) that the agency is trying to appeal to both those who live or work downtown and to visitors who want to visit local landmarks but do n't want to figure out more-complex routes .	similar routes have been used in cleveland , baltimore and washington , d.c. , among others .
tuition costs are increasing at all 16 public university campuses in north carolina to help offset cuts in the state support .	the news & observer of raleigh reported wednesday that university of north carolina system president erskine bowles approved tuition increases for the coming academic year .	the general assembly gave bowles the authority to raise tuition to offset budget cuts imposed last month .	students at unc-chapel hill and north carolina state university will pay $ 750 more in tuition , the maximum allowed .	the smallest increase will be $ 250 spread over two years at fayetteville state university .	the new tuition increases come on top of hikes of up to $ 200 for the coming year already enacted .	those increases varied by campus .
the number of initial foreclosure notices in nevada spiked just before oct. 1 , the day a state law that adds more steps for lenders seeking to foreclose took effect .	tracking website lvdefault.com counted more than 3,700 notices of default in clark county in september , more than triple the 1,149 the site counted in august , according to the las vegas review-journal .	notices reached a one-day high sept. 30 , when they hit 934 , and then dropped to 25 on tuesday , when the homeowner 's bill of rights was enacted . "	it 's been a roller coaster ride in nevada , " said daren blomquist , spokesman at analytics firm realtytrac .	his company is still finalizing its statewide data on september foreclosure filings but said there was a big upswing . "	i think it creates uncertainly in the housing market , and uncertainty is bad for free markets in general . "	it is n't the first time nevada has seen peaks just before and drop-offs just after new state housing laws took effect .	the same pattern showed up two years ago when the state enacted ab 284 , which required lenders provide more documentation about a loan 's history before they foreclosed ; and in june , when fixes to that bill took effect .	proponents of the homeowner 's bill of rights say the law is needed to prevent abuses by banks .	the law requires 30 days ' notice before a lender files the first notice of foreclosure , and requires banks to inform troubled homeowners about alternatives that can avert the process .	it requires lenders designate a single point person for each mortgage , so homeowners do n't get the runaround when they call a bank .	and it prevents " dual-tracking , " when banks pursue a foreclosure at the same time a homeowner is trying to negotiate a short sale .	but banks must adjust to the new provisions , and that takes time , according to bill uffelman of the nevada bankers association .	analysts , including blomquist , said legislative interventions could end up drawing out the recovery and creating a " long tail on the foreclosure problem .

a small cargo ship crammed with hundreds of tamil asylum seekers from sri lanka docked at a canadian navy base on friday after a grueling three-month journey .	public safety minister vic toews has said 490 are onboard and said the vessel mv sun sea has declared them to be refugees .	but he said the government has concerns that there may be members of the rebel liberation tigers of tamil eelam , or tamil tigers , on board .	canada has labeled the tamil tigers as a terrorist group since 2006 .	mv sun sea was boarded by security officials late thursday and escorted into port .	the government prepared a large tent at a seaside military facility to process the people on friday , and jails have been warned they could receive new inmates .	gary anandasangaree , a lawyer with the canadian tamil congress , was on the scene as the ship arrived .	anandasangaree said he ca n't believe how small the 59-meter ( 194-foot ) ship is considering how many people are onboard . "	it clearly gives us an idea of the type of conditions that could have been inside .	very cramped , given the size , " anandasangaree said .	several children also were believed to be on board .	toews said all the people onboard will be processed according to their claims and if they are not found to be valid they wo n't be treated as refugees .	he said some are human smugglers and terrorists .	mv sun sea reportedly approached australia a few months ago but was either turned away or feared it would n't be allowed to dock and sailed toward canada .	the canadian government is worried it is becoming a target of human smugglers .	toews has vowed canada would look at all available options to strengthen canadian laws to address what he called an " unacceptable abuse of international law and canadian generosity . "	last october , a ship carrying 76 tamil migrants was also intercepted in canadian waters .	all are free in canada while their asylum claims are being processed .	canada is home to about 300,000 tamils , the largest such population outside sri lanka and india .	the tamil tigers fought a civil war for a quarter of a century in sri lanka seeking a state independent of the ruling sinhalese majority .	the sri lankan conflict ended in may 2009 after a massive government operation against the tigers .	toews has said the tigers have used suicide bombings against civilians in sri lanka , as well as extortion and intimidation to raise funds within canada 's tamil community .	two vancouver-area jails have been told to make room for a flood of new inmates and a local hospital had set aside a special area for any passengers requiring medical attention .
with little more than a week to pass a measure to avert a government shutdown , it 's likely that a short-term funding bill will be needed to keep the government open past the dec. 11 deadline .	republican aides characterized tuesday night 's offer from house speaker paul ryan and top senate republican mitch mcconnell as an opening move , but the white house weighed in sharply , saying it threatened a government shutdown .	many lower-tier items in the massive measure have been worked out , leaving numerous policy provisions , known as " riders " as the main unresolved items . "	the effort they 're engaged in now is to lard the bill up with ideological riders , " white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters .	the initial gop offer included provisions to block new obama administration rules on power plant emissions , weaken the 2010 overhaul of financial regulations known as the dodd-frank law , and a contentious house-passed bill requiring greater scrutiny on syrians seeking refuge in the u.s. " they sent us an offer that was anti-worker , anti-labor , anti-education , anti-environment ... anti-refugee , " said top house appropriations committee democrat nita lowey of new york .	many provisions in the 12 spending bills drafted by house and senate republicans have been slapped with white house veto threats .	neither democrats nor republicans would release the proposal , but a memorandum from house democratic staff characterized it in broad strokes , citing " poison pill " riders on the environment , labor regulations , financial regulation and refugees -- but not efforts to unravel president barack obama 's signature health care law , which is being targeted in legislation currently being debated by the senate .	democrats said they would prepare a counter-offer .	the ill-will followed a story in politico that quoted anonymous republicans characterizing minority leader nancy pelosi , d-calif. , as an obstacle to the talks and blaming her for slow progress on dozens of unresolved issues . "	we have n't been talking to the press , we 've been respectful , we 've been open , understanding that we have to compromise and the rest -- and then all of a sudden , they announce , ' we 're telling the democrats time is running out , ' " pelosi told her colleagues wednesday morning . "	everything that we thought would have movement or that was still an open question , they just negated . "	despite wednesday 's blow-up , both sides remain committed to working out an agreement .	the measure follows an october pact that awarded both the pentagon and domestic cabinet agencies about $ 33 billion above tight budget " caps " that many republicans and virtually every democrat opposed . "	we 're at the first stage of this leadership negotiation , " said sen. barbara mikulski of maryland , who 's been actively involved from her post as top democrat of the appropriations committee . "	we 're far apart on these policy riders and then on some money issues .	but the policy riders are our biggest challenge . " "	we patiently await their offer , " said mcconnell spokesman don stewart .	the syrian refugee issue could become particularly contentious .	house conservatives said wednesday they would demand language in the spending bill at least as strong as legislation already passed by the house , with support from 47 democrats , to greatly increase hurdles for syrian and iraqi refugees . "	we have a constitutional duty to protect the american public , " said rep. tim huelskamp , r-kansas .	yet obama threatened to veto that bill , and in the senate more limited changes are being considered , leaving any resolution uncertain .
the los angeles county fire department will begin tracking the hiring of relatives and is drafting an anti-nepotism policy .	the changes come after a los angeles times investigation ( http://lat.ms/1rfmwjo ) released sunday found that the hiring process favors sons of la county firefighters .	the department is one of the largest local fire agencies in the country and offers six-figure pay and generous benefits .	in the last seven years , more than 12,600 people have applied and nearly 95 percent have been turned away .	the newspaper analyzed public and other records and found that at least 183 sons of current or former firefighters have bene hired since the start of 2012 .	to be hired at that rate , the newspaper says that an improbable more than 3,000 of them would have had to apply .
a condemned utah killer who has expressed remorse for his crime will ask a pardons board to commute a death penalty sentence to life in prison without parole , his lawyer said wednesday .	prosecutors say ronnie lee gardner is a cold-hearted killer who deserves no mercy . "	i know he feels remorse and has expressed that to me and others , " defense attorney andrew parnes told the associated press . "	i do n't know if that will be part of his statement or not . "	the utah board of pardons and parole announced wednesday it would hold a commutation hearing a week before gardner is set to die .	gardner has chosen the firing squad over lethal injection but is fighting the execution set for june 18 .	utah is the only state that offers the firing squad but is phasing out the option .	gardner 's commutation hearing will be held june 10 and could continue the next day , said jim hatch , a hearing officer for the parole board .	in addition , gardner 's lawyers are asking the utah supreme court to reverse the death sentence , and the court has scheduled a hearing for june 3 .	lawyers say gardner should n't be put to death because his crime was n't as extreme or shocking as murders committed by six other men previously put to death by utah .	gardner , 49 , was convicted for a fatal courthouse shooting during an escape attempt in 1985 .	he was in court then on charges of fatally shooting a bartender in a separate case .	prosecutors say they have a response if gardner shows remorse or pleads for mercy at his commutation hearing .	they will introduce a statement he allegedly made years after the courthouse shooting , when he called a prison guard a coward for failing to stop him . "	he 's our poster child for the death penalty , " assistant utah attorney general thomas brunker said wednesday . "	i mean , you got a guy who already had eight or nine felony convictions ?	most of them were robberies and aggravated assaults as a prisoner ?	who is coming to court on another capital homicide .	he murders a lawyer , fires on prison guards , shoots a bailiff in the stomach and takes hostages , all to escape , " he said .	brunker added , " this was n't his first escape .	he escaped in 1981 and stabbed a guy who would n't give him money .	he was apprehended when he broke down a guy 's door .	he escaped another time from the university of utah medical center and kidnapped a medical student .	he was on an escape when he murdered the bartender . "	gardner is being sentenced to die for pausing to shoot attorney michael burdell in the head during his most recent escape attempt .	the lawyer had no connection to gardner 's case ; he was in the wrong spot at the wrong time , in a salt lake city courthouse as gardner was trying to flee .	authorities say gardner was slipped a handgun by a girlfriend .	gardner 's attorneys contend that to execute him after 25 years on death row serves no social purpose ?	neither retribution nor deterrence ?	and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment .	the utah supreme court will hear that argument .

a cartoon santa peeps from the side of a green gift bag nestled in a pile of discarded wrapping paper in a blue recycling bin by the side of the road .	stacks of cardboard boxes for new computers , tvs and other electronic equipment are scattered throughout the route taken by scenic city recycling workers in the weeks after christmas and new year 's day .	joe fowlkes , owner of the recycling company , said the holidays are always a busy time for recyclers . "	it really starts pretty much the week after thanksgiving and gradually builds until two or three weeks after christmas , " he said . "	the week after is the heaviest .	we usually see a 50 percent increase in paper . "	for small recycling companies , it 's no easy feat to prepare for and handle the extra materials that come their way after weeks of holiday get-togethers and gift giving .	fowlkes said his crew gets started earlier each morning and works a little later each evening to keep up with the increased amount of work . "	that 's pretty much all you can do ?	is get after it , " he said .	jennifer backer , owner of united recycling services , said a route that would typically take half to three-quarters of the day will take about 11/2 days to complete after the holidays .	parties for new year 's eve will also result in an abundance of recyclable materials ranging from cardboard boxes to champagne bottles , recyclers said .	at orange grove center , which receives material from the chattanooga 's blue bag curbside recycling program , the pileup of materials lasts about two weeks after the holidays end , said plant manager bill ramsey .	since the staff is limited , its members stay busy year-round , but during the holidays will have to let the inventory build up until there 's time to " work it back down , " he said . "	when you see a dump truck , it will be full of wrapping paper and the boxes the presents come in ?	the whole dumpster will just be full of it , " ramsey said .
any weakening of a proposal to overhaul the state 's pension system could place its bond rating in jeopardy , a fiscal watchdog group warned in a letter sent to state senators preparing to debate the plan . "	the massachusetts taxpayers foundation strongly urges you to reject any amendments to the proposed pension reform legislation that would lessen the savings included in the bill , " wrote michael widmer , president of the nonpartisan , business-backed organization . "	in its current form , the proposal achieves approximately $ 5 billion in savings , the minimum goal set forth by the ( credit ) ratings agencies . "	the bill , scheduled for debate in the senate on thursday , seeks to reduce the state 's $ 17 billion unfunded pension liability by pushing back retirement ages , closing loopholes and ending perceived abuses in the system .	among other provisions , the measure would raise the minimum retirement age for most state and municipal employees from 55 to 60 while increasing the minimum age for receiving the maximum pension benefit from 65 to 67 .	the changes would apply to state employees hired after jan. 1 , 2012 .	the bill also would reduce incentives for early retirement and base pension benefits on the average of an employee 's five highest wage-earning years .	critics of the current three-year formula say it has prompted abuse by workers who accrue many years of service at low pay , then seek a high-paying job for just three years , allowing them to receive a benefit much larger than the overall contribution they made to the system .	the bill estimates savings of $ 3 billion for the state and $ 2 billion for municipalities over the next 30 years .	earlier this year , the legislature and democratic gov. deval patrick agreed to extend the schedule for fully funding the pension system from 2025 to 2040 ?	a move estimated to save the state $ 800 million in the current fiscal year but with a potential cost to the state of $ 30 billion between now and 2040 , according to widmer .	the bill largely mirrors a proposal filed in january by patrick , who has called pension reform one of his top legislative priories for this year .	one key difference , however , is that the senate proposal calls for an increase in the base amount for calculating cost-of-living increases from $ 12,000 to $ 13,000 .	the provision has been viewed by some observers as a concession to public employee unions and one that would undercut the other cost-saving reforms in the bill .	of the 39 other states that have reformed their pension systems in the last two years , none has enhanced cost-of-living benefits and 17 have reduced or eliminated them completely , widmer said .	david holway , president of the national association of government employees , said the pension contribution rate for state employees has doubled over the last 40 years and they should not be blamed for the unfunded liability . "	state employees have been paying , " holway said . "	the real problem with the pension system is that the commonwealth has n't met ( its ) obligations . "	while relieved that lawmakers have not proposed significant changes in benefits to current employees , holway said weakening of future benefits could make it more difficult for the state to retain highly skilled workers if the economy improves and there are more private-sector employees .	senators had until wednesday to file amendments to the bill .	widmer said any that further weaken the measure should be rejected during thursday 's debate . "	in recent ratings reviews , both moody 's and standard & poor 's cited the state 's large pension liabilities as a concern and highlighted the importance of pension reform for the state to maintain its rating , " widmer wrote .	massachusetts currently has a rating of aa-plus from moody 's and fitch , one notch below aaa .	standard & poor 's has given the state a rating two notches below aaa but with a positive outlook .	the bond rating systems generally use alphabetical scales from aaa down to d.

the developments came as two palestinians were shot and killed following separate attacks on israelis on thursday .	palestinians have repeatedly claimed that israel 's slow movement in making arrests in the arson reflected what they see as an unfair justice system that moves swiftly in finding palestinian suspects in violence .	they frequently cite the lack of progress as a source of anger behind a string of attacks that began in mid-september and show no signs of ending .	in the latest violence , police said a palestinian was shot and killed near the old city in jerusalem after stabbing an israeli officer and wounding him .	earlier in the day , the israeli military said a palestinian man opened fire on israelis outside of jerusalem , wounding two people before security forces shot and killed him .	the arson attack in july took place in the west bank village of duma where assailants , believed to be jewish extremists , lobbed a firebomb during the night into the dawabsheh family 's home , where four family members were asleep .	toddler ali dawabsheh was burned to death while his mother and father later died of their wounds .	the toddler 's 4-year-old brother ahmad was also hurt in the attack and is still being treated in an israeli hospital .	hebrew graffiti reading " revenge " was sprayed on the walls of the home , indicating that the attackers were possibly jewish .	israeli leaders from across the political spectrum condemned the attack , but the lack of suspects has remained a sore point among palestinians .	earlier this month , israel 's defense minister had said jewish extremists were involved , but that there was not enough evidence to prosecute .	the shin bet , israel 's internal security agency , said thursday it had arrested a number of youths belonging to a " jewish terrorist " organization and that interrogators were checking " concrete suspicions " they were connected to the duma attack .	in thursday 's shooting attack , the military said a palestinian got out of a car and opened fire near the west bank village of hizme , on jerusalem 's northern outskirts .	one soldier and a civilian were wounded before security forces killed the attacker .	a palestinian authority intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with protocol , said the shooter was a palestinian intelligence officer .	he did not elaborate or provide a motive for the attack .	since mid-september , 19 people have been killed on the israeli side in palestinian stabbings , shootings and attacks in which cars or other vehicles are used to run down people or plow into groups of pedestrians .	at least 102 palestinians have been killed , including 67 said by israel to be attackers .	the rest died in clashes with israeli security forces .	in addition , an american student was killed in a palestinian attack and an eritrean migrant was shot dead by an israeli security guard after he was mistakenly identified as an attacker .	israel blames the violence on incitement by palestinian leaders and on social media sites .	palestinians say the attacks stem from a lack of hope for gaining independence after years of failed peace efforts .	to crack down on unrest , israel last month resumed demolishing homes of palestinians accused of attacking israelis .	early thursday , the israeli army demolished the home of a palestinian accused of orchestrating the deadly shooting of an israeli couple of oct. 1 .	the military identified the man as raeb ahmed muhammad alivi , in his late 30s .	he was arrested days after the attack .	according to the army , alivi led a five-member hamas cell that shot and killed rabbi eitam henkin , a u.s. citizen , and his wife naama as they drove in the northern west bank .	their four young children in the back of the car escaped unharmed .	israel says home demolition is an effective tool to deter attacks , but critics say the tactic amounts to collective punishment .
the white house is calling on lawmakers to work out their divisions over an authorization to use military force against islamic state militants and says president barack obama is open to changes to his initial proposal to achieve a compromise .	obama wants authorization to pursue the violent extremist group across international boundaries , but would be willing to accept amendments to much of the rest of his draft , the white house says .	that includes his proposed three-year time limit on u.s. military action and the most contentious language over the use of american troops .	after a weeklong holiday break , congress returned to washington on monday and the white house is arguing it 's up to lawmakers to work out their disputes now that the president has made his offer . "	it 's their turn to take the lead and to walk it through the legislative process , " said white house press secretary josh earnest .	some republicans say obama 's proposal is too restrictive for the mission to succeed .	on the other side , some democrats want more limitations on obama 's authority so the united states does n't sign on for another open-ended war .	republican senate foreign relations chairman bob corker plans to hold hearings on the legislation over the next couple of weeks and said he 's keeping options open on the best way to proceed .	he said options include amending obama 's proposal or to " start whole cloth from a clean fresh beginning . "	obama argues he does n't need a new authorization to pursue islamic state terrorists legally ?	and he 's been launching strikes against them for months based on authorizations given to president george w. bush after the sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .	but critics say obama 's use of those authorizations is a stretch at best , and the white house has taken a new position that makes it clear it does n't see reliance on that authority as ideal , either .	white house officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations on the record .	the white house now says if a new authorization is signed into law , obama will no longer rely on the authority approved in 2001 to pursue the islamic state group and instead solely rely on the new powers .	a white house official said congress could make that clear within the statute by adding that limitation to the authorization .	the official said if they do not add such language but still pass a new authorization , obama will consider it his sole basis for operations against the militant group .	obama has said he wants to refine and ultimately repeal the 2001 authorization .	but besides the islamic state campaign , the president also is using the law as the legal basis for the continued operation of the detention center at guantanamo bay and attacks on militants in yemen and elsewhere .	obama 's proposal includes a three-year limit that would require the next president to come back to congress and ask for renewal ?	if , as obama predicts , the fight against the islamic state is still ongoing .	he also proposes a ban on " enduring offensive combat operations " as an attempt to bridge the divide in congress over the role of ground troops .	obama said the language gives him the ability for rescue missions , intelligence collection and the use of special operations forces in possible military action against islamic state leaders . "	it is not the authorization of another ground war , like afghanistan or iraq , " obama said as he announced the proposal feb. 11 .	but white house officials say they are open to alternatives to that language as long as they maintain the president 's flexibility to send in ground troops for targeted missions when needed .
vermont hunters who applied for permits to hunt antlerless deer with muzzleloaders can now check the department of fish and wildlife 's website to see if they 've won .	the fish and wildlife board approved the number of december muzzleloader permits at 12,425 for 15 of the state 's 24 wildlife management units .	biologists expect hunters to take about 2,200 antlerless deer in the muzzleloader season and about 3,000 during youth and archery seasons .	youth hunters are allowed to harvest any deer during the youth deer hunting weekend on the weekend of nov. 3 and 4 .	vermont deer biologist adam murkowski says last winter was one of the mildest in recent decades and it 's important to manage local deer herds to ensure the number of deer remains appropriate for the available habitat .

the houses where families and their mexican culture thrived in the san pablo neighborhood are long gone .	so are the haunts where kids could see a movie for a dime or sneak in through the back door of the nearby college theater on mill avenue and not pay at all .	in most cases , the memories that were made on the once crowded streets of san pablo are fading , too .	that 's simply because not too many people are alive to remember the place , and those who are ?	referred to as the los amigos de tempe ?	moved on to tempe 's victory acres neighborhood or are scattered throughout the valley .	san pablo is just one of many neighborhoods that once defined the east valley during the early part of the 20th century but gave way to the wrecking ball referred to as progress .	as the state of arizona nears its centennial celebration next year , these neighborhoods remain vivid memories for those who lived in them , saw them change with the landscape of the region and in some cases , kept in touch with their old neighbors .	the san pablo neighborhood , also affectionately called " el barrio " ( the old neighborhood ) was nestled at the base of what now is a mountain north of east university drive .	it was bordered by university drive to the south ( known then as eighth street ) , fifth street to the north , college avenue to the west and the southern pacific railroad tracks to the west .	a canal also divided two hispanic neighborhoods at the base of the buttes .	san pablo was settled by mexicans in the early 1870s , survived the great depression and two world wars .	but the neighborhood was swallowed up in the mid-1950s when arizona state college ( now arizona state university ) expanded its campus and built more dormitories .	the end was a traumatic experience for some displaced by eminent domain , especially the elderly .	the younger generation , though , saw the end coming . "	it was almost like a small town , " said charlie ruiz , 66 , a retired department of public safety officer who worked in criminal investigations .	ruiz was one of 11 children born to jose and sofia ruiz and once lived in a house at 326 e. sixth street next to the national guard base .	ruiz 's father began working for the southern pacific railroad when he was 14 , a job he would have for the next 40 years . "	the neighborhood was pretty much a united family , " ruiz said . "	everyone knew everybody .	if one kid got in trouble on the east side of the neighborhood ... by the time they went home , his parents knew about it on the west side . "	charlie 's older brother , william ruiz , 71 , said , " we did n't have video games back then ?	we made our own games .	we made our own toys , kites out of newspapers and collected soda pop bottles to cash in for money so we could go to the movies at the college theater . "	it was in san pablo , where many of the neighborhood residents worked at carl hayden 's mill or for the southern pacific railroad , that arizona experienced its earliest lessons in segregation .	beginning in 1923 , hispanics were not allowed to swim in tempe beach pool , so they swam in a swimming hole on the north side of the butte because the nearby salt river was only a " trickle . "	but in 1946 , after many of the neighborhood boys served in world war ii , hispanics again could swim with the whites at tempe beach pool .	yee 's market , a grocery store owned by a chinese family south of the tempe buttes , was where most people in the neighborhood shopped for their large families .	irene gomez hormell is the matriarch of san pablo 's history .	her family settled in the neighborhood in 1917 .	her parents , floyd gomez and victoria soto , met in san pablo and irene later grew up in a house at 358 e. 8th street ( now university drive ) during the 1940s and 50s where the family lived until 1957 .	she has fond memories of washing dishes in her mother 's restaurant , vicki 's place , where her two sisters also worked after the school day ended at our lady of mount carmel school .	the restaurant , which once stood across the street from arizona state college , served mexican and american food and was " packed " after asu football games . "	it was a wonderful neighborhood ; i loved it , " hormell , 74 , of mesa said . "	we had all the resources any kids could have for their imagination and creativity .	we had no street names , but we named them .	my study hall was on top of the tempe butte where i would read books .	the beauty of living in the barrio was that all the parents looked out for everybody 's kids because everyone knew everybody .	i would not change it for the world . "	hormell became acquainted with the neighborhood through helping her grandmother , marina ceballos soto , go door-to-door to take orders for the boston clothing store on mill avenue that was owned by the getz family in los angeles . "	those were the days before credit cards , " hormell said . "	my grandmother let customers run a tab and they always paid her off .	people always wanted to honor their name . "	although the families such as the urbanos , the sanchezes , gomezes , sotos and ruizes are gone , at least the foundation ?	the neighborhood 's anchor ?	of san pablo remains : our lady of mount carmel church on the northwest corner of college and university where families worshipped and kids attended school in the basement during the school 's early days .	that 's where some of the remaining ruiz brothers ?	rupert , william and charlie - remember how their grandfather helped pour the church 's foundation .	in fact , the cornerstone of the old church building says it was built in 1903 , and was where william ruiz would have to serve as a " go-fer boy " for the nuns if he was within their eye-shot playing nearby .	for at least one day out of the year in october , residents who lived in the san pablo neighborhood still come together for a " reunion " during the tardeada festival at the tempe community center , 3500 s. rural road .	but beyond that , anyone would be hard pressed to find remnants of san pablo in the area long dominated now by part of arizona state university 's campus .	history is about all that remains .
a south texas border patrol agent remained in jail friday , two days after being arrested on a sexual assault charge for an alleged incident with a woman he was guarding in a corpus christi hospital .	according to the complaint , philip westerman , 42 , was guarding a woman who had entered the country illegally at christus spohn hospital corpus christi-memorial on april 28 when the alleged assault occurred .	u.s. marshals arrested westerman in mcallen on wednesday on a charge of second-degree sexual assault , said nueces county first assistant district attorney gail loeb .	he remained in the hidalgo county jail friday on $ 150,000 bond , said jail spokeswoman rosa ybarra .	it was not immediately known if westerman had an attorney .	westerman , who will have been with the border patrol for three years in august , was assigned to the falfurrias station , agency spokesman henry mendiola said .	westerman was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation , mendiola said .	the fbi , corpus christi police and department of homeland security 's office of the inspector general are investigating the alleged assault .	border patrol agents are routinely assigned to guard immigrants who have entered the country illegally while they receive medical treatment .	the alleged assault occurred in the patient 's hospital room , where she had been recovering from an arm injury since april 18 , according to the complaint .	westerman told corpus christi police that he had no sexual contact with the woman , but said he had masturbated in her bathroom to explain the presence of his semen .	the woman told police westerman said he would take her to mexico if she told anyone .	she waited until the following morning to report the incident to the attending nurse , because she feared she would n't be believed .	steven alford , a spokesman for christus spohn health system said the hospital would not comment because it is an ongoing legal issue . "	cbp stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission , and the overwhelming majority of cbp employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction , working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe , " the border patrol said in a prepared statement wednesday .

president barack obama and republicans in the house of representatives are exploring whether they can end a budget standoff that has triggered a partial government shutdown and edged washington to the verge of an economy jarring federal default .	the two sides continued discussions into the night thursday after obama and top administration officials met for 90 minutes with house speaker john boehner and other republican leaders at the white house .	no agreement was reported and plenty of hurdles remained , but both sides cast their meeting positively as , for the first time , hopes emerged that a resolution might be attainable , even if only a temporary one .	obama planned a late morning white house meeting friday with republican senators , who said they would present their own options for ending the shutdown and debt limit standoff .	boehner brought a proposal to the white house meeting to extend federal borrowing authority and avoid default through nov. 22 , conditioned on obama 's agreeing to negotiate over spending cuts and the government shutdown .	but participants said the discussion expanded to ways to quickly end the separate federal government shutdown , which entered its 11th day friday .	passing temporary funding measures to keep the government running and extending its debt limit so it can pay its bills are normally routine in congress .	but republicans had been insisting on cuts and changes to obama 's 2010 health care overhaul law and other programs as the price for reopening government and extending the debt limit .	boehner 's offer indicates some movement away from that strategy , but republicans claimed victory on one front , noting that they were in negotiations with a president who had said repeatedly there would be none until the government was open and default prevented .	the speaker 's plan ?	and positive though unenthusiastic words about it from white house spokesman jay carney ?	seemed to spark a good day in the financial world .	the dow jones industrial average jumped 323 points , or 2.2 percent .	european central bank head mario draghi said that while a u.s. default would inflict " severe damage " on the global economy , the world believes washington will " find a way out of this . "	a white house statement about thursday 's meeting with house republicans said " no specific determination was made " but added , " the president looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle . "	republican house majority leader eric cantor said the meeting was " clarifying for both sides " and that following a night of negotiations , " hopefully we can see a way forward . "	the talks were held shortly before a wall street journal/nbc news poll was released bearing ominous news for the republicans .	it showed more people blaming republicans than obama for the shutdown , 53 percent to 31 percent .	just 24 percent viewed the republican party positively , compared with 39 percent with positive views of the democratic party .	one major problem for boehner 's plan was highlighted by democratic senate majority leader harry reid .	after he and fellow senate democrats had their own white house meeting with obama , reid said negotiations before the government reopens ?	a key part of boehner 's proposal ?	were " not going to happen . "	the shutdown has idled 350,000 civil servants , prevented the social security administration from revealing next year 's cost-of-living increase for recipients and curtailed many consumer safety inspections .	the obama administration has warned that the government will exhaust its borrowing authority on oct. 17 and risk being unable to pay its bills and facing default .	house republicans ' insistence on spending cuts and deficit reduction come with the 2013 budget shortfall expected to drop below $ 700 billion after four years exceeding $ 1 trillion annually .	but their insistence on cuts in the health care law as the price for reopening government has frustrated many senate republicans , who see that battle as unwinnable .	that has prompted republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and other republican senators to seek their own possible resolution to the shutdown and debt limit fights .	republican sen. susan collins and others have proposed a six-month extension of government spending , repeal of the medical device tax and greater flexibility for agencies to deal with across-the-board spending cuts in effect this year .	reid has proposed extending the debt limit through 2014 , which would boost the current $ 16.7 trillion debt limit by around $ 1 trillion .	he has been planning for a test vote by saturday on the measure , which has no other conditions , but republicans may have enough votes to block it unless he agrees to changes .
@ by tim higgins detroit free press general motors on monday announced an $ 865 million net profit for the first three months of the year , the first time the detroit automaker has posted positive quarterly results since 2007 and a major victory coming out of bankruptcy reorganization last summer .	gm reported an operating income of $ 1.2 billion on $ 31.5 billion in revenue .

alaska police officers would be allowed to make warrantless arrests for some misdemeanors under a proposed law in the state legislature .	bill sponsor rep. cathy mu?oz , r-juneau , said the bill would strengthen law enforcement 's ability to arrest people on the spot for misdemeanors committed against a person .	assistant juneau police chief page decker said these crimes include misdemeanor assault , stalking and indecent exposure , among others .	unless an officer witnesses a misdemeanor crime as it is occurring , decker said an officer must get a witness to authorize a citizen 's arrest of a person .	in testimony before the house judiciary committee , which is considering the bill , juneau police lt. kris sell said police sometimes have to release a person accused of a misdemeanor if they do n't have a warrant for their arrest .	sell told the committee of one instance in which a person accused of misdemeanor assault on a juneau street was released because witnesses were too afraid of retaliation to sign a citizen 's arrest form for the suspect . "	i 'm asking you to let the police ... protect citizens and to do so immediately after a citizen is attacked , " sell said .	the law has exceptions for misdemeanors related to domestic violence , violations of protective orders or conditions of release from prison .	quinlen steiner , direct of the alaska public defender agency , said he was worried that expanding warrantless arrests could put people in jail for minor crimes that fall within the category of a misdemeanor against a person .	for instance , a person who drives too fast on an icy day and runs a stop sign could be arrested for misdemeanor reckless endangerment , steiner said . "	in essence what this does is bypass any review of the arrest decision , " steiner said .	rep. lindsey holmes , an anchorage democrat and committee member , said she was also concerned that hearsay could be used to authorize a warrantless arrest .	she has proposed an amendment that would limit the warrantless arrests only in cases in which a suspect poses imminent harm to the public . "	no police officer wants to be in a position of being sued for wrongful arrest , " holmes said . "	we want to protect public from violent people , but we also want to protect them from wrongful arrest . "

spirit aerosystems and its unions asked a federal court tuesday to dismiss the workers ' claims against the wichita aircraft maker , agreeing there is not enough evidence to support the class-action lawsuit it faces over pension benefits .	the litigation was first filed in august 2005 by the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace stemming from spirit 's purchase earlier that year of boeing co. 's commercial aircraft operations in wichita .	the international association of machinists and aerospace workers joined the case in january 2007 .	a year later , the court consolidated into the litigation a similar case brought by several workers .	plaintiffs continue to pursue their claims against co-defendant boeing .	the lawsuit was brought on behalf of boeing pension participants who had at least 10 years of service and who were between ages 49 and 55 when they went to work for spirit around june 17 , 2005 in the wake of the sale of boeing 's commercial operations in wichita .	the case is n't short on paperwork .	the filing shows plaintiffs have produced more than 24,000 pages of documents ; 220,000 pages from boeing and 68,000 from spirit .	the parties also questioned 36 witnesses during depositions .	in the joint motion filed in federal court , attorneys for the plaintiffs said they could not find evidence spirit had violated its pension plans or bargaining agreements after it assumed certain assets and liabilities for pension benefits earned by former boeing employees .	the retiree health care benefits specifically sought in the lawsuit were not a part of the purchase agreement , and the unions concluded that spirit had agreed only to offer future retiree health care benefits when it bought boeing 's assets .	attorneys for the plaintiffs told the court that under these circumstances , their claims against spirit lacked sufficient evidence to continue the lawsuit .	their court filing says dismissing the claims with prejudice ?	meaning the claims could not be raised again ?	is " an appropriate resolution .

after nearly 38 years of being bused to the genoa elementary school cafeteria for lunch , genoa central high school students recently received a new cafeteria all their own .	students from the genoa central school district 's ninth , 10th , 11th and 12th grades filed into the new 2,000-square-foot dining area one day last week ready to partake of the cafeteria 's sausage , toast and biscuits as well as assorted juices .	since the fall of 1972 , the district 's high school students have had to board buses for transport to the elementary school , about a half-mile down the road , said genoa superintendent albert murphy .	murphy , superintendent for the last six years , said the district stopped using the high school 's old cafeteria in 1972 when the district opened a new , roomier cafeteria at the elementary . "	we felt like it was now time to open a new high school cafeteria for safety as well as for convenience , " murphy said .	after opening a new cafeteria in the elementary school in 1972 , the district used the old high school cafeteria as a classroom building , murphy said .	the district tore down that building , which had about 800 square feet , in the summer of 2007 after it outlived even its usefulness as a classroom building . "	it was just a white wood-frame , pier and beam building , " murphy said .	with 2,000 square feet of dining space and almost as much kitchen space , the new cafeteria can hold 160 to 180 of the district 's 270 high school students .	lunch is served in two shifts .	besides lunch , usually about 80 to 90 students show up for the school 's breakfast , served between 7:30 and 8 a.m. each day , murphy said .	the district built the new cafeteria for $ 1,218,570 and opened it about two weeks ago with a kitchen containing freezer and cooler storage space along with dry storage and a staff of four full-time cooks and one part-time cook .	along with the cafeteria , the district added a hallway , running parallel to what could include more classroom buildings in the future , murphy said .	besides the cafeteria , the district built a lobby area just to the east of the dining room , which will be used to house the district 's pictorial , student , faculty , staff , administration and school board history , murphy added .	the lobby has 12 lighted wall spaces that will soon be used as display areas for listings of each of the district 's annual graduation classes , starting from 1930 and running to 2006 .	there will also be listings of past school board members , along with past superintendents , principals , teachers , staff , bus drivers and others . "	it will be commemorative for the school district , " murphy said .
bus drivers and the management of the chittenden county transportation agency continued to spar over details of a new contract monday as the bus strike affecting vermont 's largest county continued into its second week .	union leaders rob slingerland and mike walker said ccta told the union after a saturday negotiating session that their demands could not be met , prompting the drivers to leave since they felt they were wasting their time .	the drivers , speaking at a monday news conference in downtown burlington near the company 's main bus stop , said they are n't concerned with money . "	we 're here for a respectable and livable contract , and that 's all we demand , " slingerland said .	ccta said the saturday negotiation session ended when union representatives walked out .	the strike of about 70 drivers began march 17 .	the chittenden county bus routes carried 10,000 passengers a day , including students and workers .	ccta general manager bill watterson said there are four main issues keeping the two parties from reaching an agreement ?	wages , disciplinary action from anonymous tips , part-time drivers and split-shifts .	slingerland and walker said ccta did not present the union with a complete contract during the saturday session .	but ccta spokeswoman meredith birkett said monday the transportation authority did provide a proposal , omitting articles that already had been agreed upon .	the proposal included some compromises to union positions , but demands that the company felt would threaten safety were n't included , ccta said in a news release .	union leaders said a main point of contention is how discipline would be handled when accusations come from an anonymous tip system that drivers say will be abused by management .	anonymous complaints can not be stand-alone evidence for discipline , but ccta said throwing out the system entirely would be a " complete abdication " of responsibility to safety .	slingerland said ccta was trying to weaken the union 's resolve . "	the fact that the ccta stonewalls negotiations with loopholes and nitpicking every little thing we propose is just another tactic to try and wear us down , " slingerland said at the news conference . "	and wear us down they will not . "	the transportation authority said in a weekend statement that it 's disappointed an agreement was not reached .	no upcoming meeting with ccta has been scheduled yet , according to bus union leaders .
on a cycle as regular as spring rains followed by summer humidity , we can count on some elected official or government agency proposing bad ideas about public information .	this time , again , it 's the department of natural resources , trying to peddle in the state budget another version of a tired idea that was rebuffed in the 2011 legislative session .	the broad issue is about public notices of various government activity .	in this case , the topic in question is the sale of timber land in wisconsin , and the dnr 's responsibility to let the citizenry know when and where such sales are to occur .	last time around , the topic was water regulations and oversight of the state 's navigable waters .	other like-minded attempts in the past involved the minutes of school board meetings , the votes taken , and wrong-headed attempts to limit the publication of that information .	some elected officials and public agencies want to keep public information under wraps .	they would expect citizens to ferret out important records on their own by digging through various government websites .	whether it 's dnr plans for timber sales or changes to water rights , or the minutes from a school or city council meeting , those records should be easily obtainable and quickly accessible by citizens everywhere .	and the best way to do that is to publish such legal notices in local newspapers , from the smallest in the state to the largest .	newspapers also post government notices online , where they are searchable on a single website .	part of wisconsin 's great heritage in good government is our open records and open meetings law .	our law is among the strongest and most useful in the country .	and it requires third-party publication of important public information .	that third-party role , a function effectively filled by local newspapers for generations , removes the " fox guarding the henhouse " scenario that would exist if government entities were able to simply post their information on their own websites , as suggested by the dnr .	sure , newspapers make money from public notices , and we would prefer to keep that revenue coming in .	but far more important is the concept of open , accessible governmental bodies and a free flow of public information .	burying that public information on government websites would be a giant step backward for wisconsin .

concerned residents sent a flurry of emails to appleton mayor tim hanna last month after two men showed up armed with assault rifles near the city 's farmers market , according to a new analysis .	a few emails supported the men 's second amendment rights , but most were from residents who threatened to stay away from future public events if firearms could be present , the post crescent media reported ( http://post.cr/1gqb9jo ) . "	as long as there are people with guns walking around this city , my family will not be , " wrote adam fredrick , of appleton .	the men were carrying ar-15 assault rifles legally near the market on sept. 7 .	police detained them at gunpoint and handcuffed them before eventually releasing them without tickets . "	if these idiots are this paranoid perhaps they should stay home and protect their fortress and not wander around on the streets , " mary rutten , of appleton , wrote of the men . "	i do not want to live like this where people feel they have to carry guns to protect themselves at a public and/or family event . "	other writers were worried about how the incident might affect the city 's reputation .	some asked hanna to figure out creative ways to keep the city safe for families without violating state law .	hanna noted that open-carry laws are governed by state statute and ca n't be altered by city ordinance .	he added that he 'd like to see the state law changed , but acknowledged that the chances of that happening are remote .	two emailers criticized police for handcuffing and questioning the two men . "	the encounter should have been consensual ( as ) they have not broken any laws and are minding their own business , " wrote joseph rugg , of new york .	state law allows for gun rules to be established for special events as long as there are designated entrances or admission fees .	that could leave room for a compromise , alderwoman sarah garb said .	she suggested charging a $ 1 entrance fee to the farmers ' market or setting up a rope line to constitute an entrance .

u.s. consumer prices rose only slightly last month as gas costs increased more slowly .	overall , the figures showed that inflation remains mild .	the labor department said thursday that the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in july after a 0.5 percent increase in june .	gas prices rose just 1 percent after jumping 6.3 percent in june .	excluding food and gas costs , which are volatile , " core " prices also rose 0.2 percent in july .	over the past 12 months , consumer prices have risen 2 percent .	core prices have increased 1.7 percent in the past 12 months , still below the federal reserve 's 2 percent inflation target .	slightly higher inflation could make it easier for the fed to start pulling back on its low-interest-rate policies .	falling inflation would pressure the fed to continue stimulating growth .	the fed announced after its july meeting that it planned to continue buying $ 85 billion a month in bonds to keep downward pressure on long-term interest rates .	it also said it planned to maintain a key short-term rate near zero , where it 's remained since december 2008 ?	at least as long as unemployment stays above 6.5 percent .	but chairman ben bernanke and several other fed officials have said the central bank could start slowing its bond purchases later this year .	some economists think such a change could be announced at the fed 's next meeting on sept. 17-18 .	most analysts expect the slowdown to be gradual .	new bond purchases might not end until mid-2014 ?	and only then if the unemployment rate has dropped to around 7 percent .	more expensive fruits and vegetables pushed up the price of food in july , which ticked up just 0.1 percent .	meat , chicken and fish also rose in price , while other food groups fell .	baked goods and cereals , milk and other dairy products , and fruit juices and other drinks all fell in price .	core prices were pushed up by a big jump in clothing costs , which rose 0.6 percent , the third straight gain .	rents and new car prices also rose .	airline fares , meanwhile , fell 1.3 percent last month .	economic growth is too slow and unemployment too high to spur much inflation .	hourly wages and incomes have barely grown since the recession ended four years ago .	that makes it hard for retailers to raise prices .	unemployment dropped in july to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent in june .	the july figure was a 4 ?	- year low , but it was still well above the 5 percent to 6 percent range that economists associate with a healthy economy .	the economy grew at a scant annual rate of 0.1 percent in the october-december quarter and then at lackluster annual rates of 1.1 percent in the first three months of this year and 1.7 percent in the april-june quarter .	but many economists think growth will accelerate to a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second half of this year as the effects of tax increases and government spending cuts begin to fade .

a northern maine man is going to prison for five years for smuggling marijuana from canada into the united states .	forty-eight-year-old allen gagnon , of van buren , was sentenced monday in u.s. district court in bangor .	he pleaded guilty in june to marijuana smuggling and distribution .	prosecutors say gagnon last winter wore a white camouflage outfit to walk across the frozen st. john river into canada and return with trash bags filled with pot .	the bangor daily news says gagnon drew attention five years ago when he laid claim to a duffel bag filled with $ 165,000 in cash that was found by railroad workers beside some railroad tracks near his home .	gagnon claimed the money was his life savings , but a judge later ruled the money belonged to the government .
france 's lower house of parliament appeared ready tuesday to approve a ban on burqa-like islamic veils , a move that is popular among french voters despite concerns from muslim groups and human rights advocates .	the issue is potent in europe : several other countries have similar proposals in the works , including belgium and spain , and they are closely watching the bill 's progress in france .	after tuesday 's vote , the ban on face-covering veils will go in september to the senate , where it is also likely to pass .	its biggest hurdle will likely come after that , when france 's constitutional watchdog scrutinizes it .	some legal scholars say there is a chance it could be deemed unconstitutional .	the main body representing french muslims says face-covering veils are not required by islam and not suitable in france , but it worries that the law will stigmatize muslims in general .	france 's has europe 's largest muslim population , estimated to be about 5 million of the country 's 64 million people .	while ordinary headscarves are common , only about 1,900 women in france are believed to wear face-covering veils .	champions of the bill say they oppress women .	with the proposed ban , the government is also seeking to insist that integration is the only path for immigrant minorities .	france has had difficulty integrating generations of immigrants and their children , as witnessed by weeks of rioting by youths , many of them minorities , in troubled neighborhoods in 2005 .	at the national assembly , the lower house , relatively few dissenters have spoken out about civil liberties or fears of fanning anti-islam sentiment .	a survey by the pew global attitudes project released last week found that an overwhelming 82 percent of french respondents support a ban .	the niqab and burqa are generally seen here as a gateway to extremism and an attack on women 's rights and secularism , a central value of modern-day france .	life in france is " carried out with a bare face , " justice minister michele alliot-marie said last week .	critics say the proposed ban is a cynical ploy by conservative french president nicolas sarkozy 's government to attract far-right voters .	discussions in france have dragged on for more than a year , since sarkozy declared in june 2009 that the burqa is not welcome in france .	in march , france 's highest administrative body , the council of state , warned that the law could be found unconstitutional .	it rejected possible legal justifications one by one , including the french tradition of secularism , equality for women , human dignity and concerns about public security .	the legislation would forbid face-covering muslim veils in all public places in france , even in the street .	it calls for ?	150 ( $ 185 ) fines or citizenship classes , or both .	the bill is also aimed at husbands and fathers ?	anyone convicted of forcing someone else to wear the garb risks a year of prison and a ?	30,000 ( $ 38,000 ) fine , with both penalties doubled if the victim is a minor .	officials have taken pains to craft language that does not single out muslims .	while the proposed legislation is colloquially referred to as the " anti-burqa law , " it is officially called " the bill to forbid concealing one 's face in public . "	it refers neither to islam nor to veils .	officials insist the law against face-covering is not discriminatory because it would apply to everyone , not just muslims .	yet they cite a host of exceptions , including motorcycle helmets , or masks for health reasons , fencing , skiing or carnivals .	anticipating a ban on the veils , an entrepreneur who tried to run for president in 2007 , rachid nekkaz , is creating a fund to pay the fines of anyone caught wearing a niqab or burqa .	while he says he opposes the full veils , he says a ban would be anti-democratic , and he is creating the fund " so that my country is not the disgrace of the whole world .

a vigil over a fatal police shooting of a teenager that turned violent has led to an anger exchange between a brooklyn councilman and the police commissioner .	councilman jumaane williams criticized police commissioner raymond kelly at a council hearing tuesday for characterizing the community 's anger as a mere " disturbance . "	kelly retorted he noticed williams " did n't ' mention anything about a 16-year-old with a gun that brought about this incident . "	williams said the shooting and protest were not isolated incidents of how the nypd reacts to minority neighborhoods .	he said " it is about years of not being heard . "	kelly said he attends community meetings all the time .	kimani gray was fatally shot saturday .	police say he pointed a gun at them .	dozens of people threw bottles and damaged stores while protesting monday .
turkish lawyers representing pro-palestinian activists filed a complaint thursday with the international criminal court accusing israel of committing war crimes in may when its troops raided a boat trying to break israel 's blockade of gaza .	it was unclear whether the prosecutor would agree to pursue the case or whether the court has jurisdiction .	but the filing reignited an issue that has severely strained israel 's relations with turkey , previously its strongest ally in the muslim world , and keeps israel on the defensive over its much-criticized gaza blockade .	a delegation representing some 300 activists and a turkish nongovernment organization submitted the complaint to the prosecutor 's office in the hague seeking an investigation into the may 31 raid .	nine turkish citizens , including 19-year-old furkan dogan who had dual u.s.-turkish nationality , were killed during the melee after israeli troops rappelled from helicopters onto the deck of the ship mavi marmara before dawn . "	i have confidence the international court and the prosecutor will take this case , " said ahmet dogan , furkan 's father .	israel has said its troops fired live ammunition only after they were attacked by activists with clubs and metal bars and they felt their lives were in danger .	attorney ugur sevgili said the victims want israel investigated for torture , inhuman treatment , the taking of hostages and other violations of the geneva war crimes convention . "	we demanded from the prosecutor to initiate an investigation and prosecute the perpetrators of this crime , " sevgili said . "	we did n't mention any israeli soldiers or any israeli politicians .	we just told them that we believe war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed . "	the court , which began work in 2002 as the world 's first permanent war crimes tribunal , receives hundreds of complaints every year , but so far has filed indictments against 17 war crimes suspects ?	all of them involved in african conflicts .	dogan , speaking outside the court 's headquarters , said he thought politics might get in the way of justice . "	i believe that people who killed my son will be prosecuted .	however , this case also has international and political dimensions , " he said .	a u.n.-appointed panel of human rights experts , chaired by a former judge of the international court , found last month that israel violated human rights law during its interception of the flotilla carrying humanitarian supplies to gaza , which has been under an israeli blockade for three years .	israel rejected the panel 's findings , which it said were biased and one-sided , and said the u.n. human rights council that appointed the panel is heavily weighted in the palestinians ' favor .	the court normally intercedes only if the country involved is among the 114 nations that have endorsed the court 's founding treaty .	israeli is not a signatory , but the ship was flying the flag of the comoros island , which is a member of the court .	sevgili said he expected the comoros to support the victims ' application to the court or file its own complaint .	the prosecutor also may initiate an investigation even if the accused country does not belong to the court ?	but only if he determines that the country is unable to launch its own credible investigation of human rights abuses .	among the complaints submitted and presumably pending in the prosecutor 's office is an application by the palestinian authority 18 months ago asking for a war crimes investigation into israel 's brief yet deadly 2008 war in gaza .
tampa , the city where republicans will gather next week to nominate mitt romney as their presidential candidate is known for its cigars , the rollercoasters at busch gardens and for its naked ladies .	the man who almost single-handedly made tampa 's adult entertainment world famous is joe redner , a wiry 72-year-old with a bemused smile and skeptical brown eyes who owns what is arguably the most notorious of tampa 's all-nude clubs : mons venus .	the club ?	located less than 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) from where the republicans will gather for their national convention ?	is n't much to look at .	the blue-and-purple building sits on a busy stretch of road next to a taco bell and near where the nfl champion buccaneers play home games .	there 's a sign outside that says " home of the most beautiful women in the world , " and another : " live nude shows . " "	i do n't expect the rnc to be as busy as super bowl , " redner said , referring to the republican national convention . "	i do n't think those people are coming to party . "	redner started the club 30 years ago .	back then , according to him , his main pursuits were " drinking , philandering and snorting cocaine . "	he knew nothing about business or politics .	but over the decades , he stopped drinking and doing drugs , became a vegan , a businessman and a politician .	like-minded progressive activists have called him a " folk hero , " while his enemies have called him a " pimp . "	over time , he 's opened three other nude clubs ( he no longer owns them ) , a fitness club ( he sold that too ) , and has run for various local offices nine times ( he 's never won , although he did offer free lap dances to anyone who showed up at the mons with an " i voted " sticker as part of his campaign ) .	at one point , the tampa bay times reported that he was worth $ 18 million .	he has a deep box of yellowing newspaper clippings from around the world , chronicling his outspoken , and some would say outrageous , views . "	the clubs in tampa would n't have notoriety if it was n't for joe , " said don kleinhans , the co-owner of 2001 odyssey , a strip club across the street from mons venus that 's notable for its large , silver spaceship where patrons can obtain expensive , and more personal , lap dances . "	he just has strong beliefs in his rights and his freedoms . "	redner says his biggest accomplishment has been in the battles he 's waged against local , state and federal governments ?	some successful , others not .	after opening his first strip club ?	redner prefers the term " adult entertainment " ?	he was arrested 36 times on obscenity charges by officials .	he claimed that it was his first amendment right to operate the club .	in 2000 , redner vehemently opposed the so-called " six-foot rule , " a county ordinance preventing adult entertainers from coming within six feet ( two meters ) of their clients .	the rule is still on the books , but is n't enforced .	in 2005 , when hillsborough county commissioners voted to ban the county from participating in or acknowledging gay pride events , redner filed a discrimination lawsuit against the city .	he also dropped a bombshell within the lawsuit , which required him as plaintiff to show a personal connection to the case : he is gay .	the lawsuit was settled in 2007 , and the county reworded the policy so it shall not " be construed to prevent citizens from exercising their first amendment rights in an appropriate forum . "	earlier this year , redner was diagnosed with stage iv lung cancer .	he thinks it 's from all the marijuana he 's smoked over the years , a habit that he says he 's quit .	radiation was successful , he said , showing a reporter before and after x-rays of a spot on his lung .	he never worried about dying , he said .	people would tell him that they were praying for his recovery .	his answer : do n't bother . "	they say there are no atheists in foxholes , " he said . "	i 'm one . "	the only visible casualty of his illness was his long , grey ponytail ; now , his hair is short .	sitting in his office at redner enterprises ?	a warehouse he shares with his son , who runs a well-known brewing company ?	he looks like what he is : an older businessman , albeit one who is surrounded by adult entertainment industry magazines and snapshots of his various skirmishes with local government .	he 's still involved in community issues .	he goes to county commission meetings and recently , stopped in to an american civil liberties union meeting about the rnc .	he 's worried that protests will get out of hand and that police will use too much force on demonstrators ?	especially since he 's letting some occupy tampa members camp and protest 24/7 on a private lot he owns west of downtown .	redner 's been in the news for that , lately , as well ; residents of the area are fed up with the campers and are worried the rnc will draw thousands of people to the neighborhood .	redner does n't talk much about the actual republicans coming to town ; he considers himself a very liberal progressive .	he does n't like the republicans ' politics , but is hopeful that will bring money into the community .	his club 's business is down by 50 percent since its heyday in the late 90s , he said .	tampa is in a recession .	jason lange , an adult industry promoter , agrees with redner that tampa-area clubs probably wo n't receive a windfall because of the rnc . "	a lot of people are thinking it 's going to be a super home run , but it 's not , " said lange , who has booked some private parties for rnc-goers and is bringing in porn stars as entertainers at certain clubs during that week . "	the mitt romneys are n't going to go into adult entertainment clubs . "	nonetheless , police have cracked down on strip clubs recently .	during a recent sting at several area strip clubs , tampa officers arrested 16 women on prostitution charges at area strip clubs .	a news release said officials were trying to deter prostitution and human trafficking during the upcoming convention .	no one was arrested at redner 's mons venus club .	other strip club owners in tampa are more optimistic than lange about seeing more customers ; 2001 odyssey 's kleinhans said he 's put in a vip area for the rnc , complete with a private entrance around the side of the club , so anyone who wants to sneak in unannounced can do so .	redner refuses to do that for his customers . "	i ca n't play to that part of human nature , " sniffs redner . "	if you got ta hide from what you 're doing , you should n't be doing it . "	folks have been wondering what redner will do during the rnc .	will he protest and get arrested , like he did when president george w. bush and his brother , jeb , held a tampa rally in 2008 ?	will he offer some outrageous promotion at the mons ?	tip reporters off if a famous politician comes into the club ?	nope .	none of that .	he 's going to be in vegas , for a gentlemen 's club expo .	he 's the keynote speaker . "	i went back and forth on whether to go , " he said . "	but really , my presence is n't necessary . "

anadarko petroleum corp. , which owns a quarter of bp plc 's blown-out oil well in the gulf of mexico , late friday blasted bp " reckless decisions and actions " that led to the well 's explosion .	anadarko chairman and ceo jim hackett 's statement came after some elected officials said anadarko should help pay for the massive cleanup and spill-related claims .	company spokesman john christiansen said the comments were in response to " a week 's worth of testimony " and other information and data compiled on the disaster . "	the mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of bp 's reckless decisions and actions , " said hackett in the statement . "	we recognize that ultimately we have obligations under federal law related to the oil spill , but will look to bp to continue to pay all legitimate claims as they have repeatedly stated that they will do . "	the information disclosed this week " indicates bp operated unsafely and failed to monitor and react to several critical warning signs during the drilling " the statement continued . "	bp 's behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct . "	bp chief executive officer tony hayward said in a statement that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations " these allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the gulf coast , " hayward said . "	other parties besides bp may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . "	anadarko had no employees on the well and was a non-operating partner in the project .	a subsidiary of mitsui & co. ltd. of japan had a 10 percent stake .	the rig was owned by transocean ltd. of switzerland and operated by bp .	anadarko also hinted at potential legal action against bp .	the statement said bp had a duty to perform the drilling " in a good and workmanlike manner and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations . "	the contract also holds bp responsible to its co-owners for damages " caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct . "	christiansen would not say whether anadarko could be absolved of paying spill-related costs if lawmakers find bp negligent , or confirm that anadarko intends to take legal action . "	we 're looking at what 's available to us under our contractual remedies , " he said .	anadarko said any actions it takes " to protect its rights relative to bp 's performance " will not shift the financial burden to taxpayers .	anadarko 's statement came as bp 's chairman said hayward was on his way out of the day-to-day oversight of the oil spill crisis , a day after he was pummeled by lawmakers in an appearance on capitol hill .	hayward 's refusal on thursday to answer lawmakers ' questions , claiming that he was out of the loop , left many members of a house committee furious .	bp still has not said what caused the blast at the well .

the arranged marriage -- or perhaps it 's more of an arranged fling -- begins with a phone call .	someone from the henry doorly zoo & aquarium talks with an intermediary , a scientific love doctor who matches animals with the right breeding partners .	the omaha world-herald ( http://bit.ly/1l6zvch ) reports that person keeps a list with genetic traits and bios of every animal of that species living in american zoos . "	on the genetics side , it 's a big dating service , " said dr. don moore , senior scientist with the smithsonian institution and the association of zoos and aquariums , which accredits zoos like omaha 's . "	on the husbandry and medical side , it 's kind of a side service to the dating service to say , ' once these animals start dating , are they going to date in a healthy way ? ' ? "	if it 's a match , then the two zoos can make a deal .	it 's at that point that the conversation can branch off in all sorts of directions .	because , as it turns out , there 's not just one way to acquire a zoo animal .	plenty of animals are bought and sold , and some come from the wild .	but more often , zoos share animals through loans , donations or other methods .	troublemakers , illegal or unwanted pets and aimlessly wandering creatures can find themselves on exhibit .	every animal at the zoo has its own origin story .	it started , like most transactions do , with a phone call to the love doctor .	when the omaha zoo set out to buy its three newest giraffes , a curator at the zoo called lanny brown at the nashville zoo .	brown is in charge of the aza 's nationwide breeding plan for giraffes .	each major species has someone like brown , and that person is usually someone at another zoo who is an expert on one specific animal .	that person , known as the program leader or coordinator of the species survival plan , is the go-to for any zoo that 's looking to buy or sell .	the aza established the species survival plan 20 years ago to work toward conservation .	there are now plans in place across the country for 590 species .	when a zoo has extra animals or wants to get rid of some , it tells someone like brown .	then brown looks at the profiles of every animal that zoo owns and finds a mate at a zoo that is looking to buy .	brown 's job is to try to match giraffes that are genetically very different from one another with an emphasis on avoiding inbreeding .	once the program leader finds a few prospective mates , the zoo can take that list and start negotiating with the owners of those animals .	usually , the negotiation does n't involve money .	zoos are more likely to loan or donate animals .	and when there is a fee , usually for marquee animals , that fee often goes to conservation efforts , not the other zoo 's pockets .	giraffes are one of the exceptions .	they 're " usually a pretty good money-maker , " said dan cassidy , the omaha zoo 's general curator .	mike crocker , director of the dickerson park zoo in springfield , missouri , said he 's had offers as high as $ 50,000 from private collectors .	most zoos decline offers from private parks in order to keep giraffes in accredited zoos .	so zoos like omaha get the good-guy discount .	dickerson park just sold a 1-year-old female giraffe , annabelle , to omaha 's zoo for between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 .	the zoo got a similar deal on zola , a 1-year-old from the great plains zoo in sioux falls , south dakota , and layla , a 5-year-old from the nashville zoo .	male giraffes , and males of most species , cost much less .	one male can breed with almost a dozen females , cassidy said , so zoos need fewer males .	those normally sell for less than half the cost of their female counterparts .	when cassidy started at the zoo in the 1970s , zoos used to cold-call other zoos , looking to buy or sell animals .	there was no middle man .	zoos back then often turned to the wild for new animals .	now , they do all they can to keep business between zoos .	reaching into the wild for animals is a sort of last resort for zoos .	oftentimes , it means zoos in general are struggling to breed the species .	omaha 's zoo relies on wild populations for sharks and rays , cassidy said -- they just do n't propagate in zoos very well .	other times , it 's more of a rescue effort .	over time , human encroachment and habitat loss have led to human-animal conflict .	in cases where locals have to choose between relocating the animal or euthanizing it , the aza prefers the former .	moore said those animals can serve as ambassadors for their species . "	for a lot of people , the only place to be engaged and inspired in wildlife conservation is to be in a zoo and to look a living animal in the eye , to smell that living animal , to hear that living animal , " moore said . "	it 's totally different than seeing it on video . "	the henry doorly zoo & aquarium is doing just that with elephants .	in 2012 , zoo ceo and executive director dennis pate partnered with two other zoos , the dallas zoo and the sedgwick county zoo in wichita , kansas , to find an elephant herd in the wild .	domestically , zoos are struggling to breed elephants .	there are n't many breeding-age elephants available for transfer from other zoos , so in order to fill the gigantic new african grasslands elephant herd room , pate had to turn elsewhere . "	we do n't want to take animals out of the wild -- we want to build sustainable collections here that are n't dependent on the wild , " pate said . "	that 's the goal .	but we 're not there yet with elephants . "	in february 2014 , pate traveled to swaziland for the first time and , on first sight , he and the other zoos agreed to take ownership of 18 elephants that the big game parks trust planned to otherwise kill .	the elephants were destroying the habitat that black rhinos relied on in the mkhaya game reserve and hlane national park .	as part of the transaction , the three zoos agreed to contribute $ 450,000 to the big game parks trust for black rhino conservation .	when shipping endangered animals overseas , the red tape is extensive .	the endangered species act and the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora treaty of 1973 restrict what zoos can do , and they have to file for a permit from the u.s. fish and wildlife service .	the three zoos did that last november .	a decision is expected in the next month .	the case of the zoo 's new elephants is extraordinarily rare , pate said .	there has n't been an elephant import of this size in decades .	almost 95 percent of all birds and mammals in zoos are bred in captivity , moore said .	pulling from the wild is the exception , not the rule .	plenty of animals are freebies , with a catch .	when zoos have spare animals that they do n't have space for -- say , a gorilla -- they go through the species survival plan program leader and put the animal on a list .	for some species , usually less-threatened ones , zoos can access that list of available animals online .	the process usually follows the same steps it would if the zoo were buying an animal , except instead of exchanging cash and outright selling the animal , the zoos agree to a loan .	that loan can go a couple of different ways .	sometimes , there 's cash exchanged , but usually the receiving zoo gets to keep the animal for the remainder of its life without paying a fee .	the sending zoo can recall the animal whenever it wants , but it has to meet agreed-upon conditions to do so , and cassidy said he ca n't recall a time where that has happened in omaha .	in exchange , the sending zoo gets that animal 's first offspring .	sometimes the zoo specifies that it wants the first female .	that 's called a breeding loan .	it 's the most frequent type of loan omaha 's zoo participates in . "	usually , when something goes here on loan , it usually never comes back .	it 'll stay here the rest of its life , " cassidy said . "	but once in a while , there are cases where it 's a short-term loan and you know that going into it . "	like the time the zoo borrowed a komodo dragon .	in 1999 , the zoo brought a 12-year-old komodo in from the minneapolis zoo for the summer to boost attendance .	the zoo has also rented koalas in the past .	short-term loans like these usually come with a price tag and a breeding restriction .	they 're called exhibit loans .	in the case of the komodo , the zoo loaned the minneapolis zoo a white tiger in exchange for the dragon for the summer .	on a smaller scale , the zoo sometimes borrows animals from government entities , like the u.s. fish and wildlife service .	salt creek tiger beetles and black-footed ferrets are both currently on semi-permanent loan from the government on the condition that the zoo breed the animals .	fortunately for the zoo 's bottom line , most of its animal transactions are absolutely free .	other zoos are usually happy to give their animals a good home .	and they 're happy with the unspoken expectation that some species come without a premium .	like bongo .	the horned creature is one of the largest species of antelope in africa .	it will have a home in the new african grasslands in the shadow of its chief predators , cheetahs and lions , and it did n't cost the zoo a fee to buy the males for its herd .	when the zoo acquired a male bongo from the milwaukee county zoo in 2012 , it only cost shipping and handling .	the zoo has also received donations in the form of meerkats from scottsbluff , african black-footed cats from kansas city , tarantulas from toronto , coua ( a madagascan bird ) from san diego and impala from disney 's wildlife reserves . "	donation is the word i always prefer when things are coming this way , " cassidy said . "	sale is the word i prefer when they 're going out . "	but the zoo does n't always love getting handouts .	for years , cassidy said , neighbors had a tendency to drop off pets , assuming the zoo wanted their orphans .	cassidy said the zoo has seen plenty of fish , parrots and rabbits over the years , but the zoo tries to discourage people from discarding their unwanted pets .	they do n't mind free bongo , but they 're full up on bunnies .	some animal origin stories are stranger than others .	some of the zoo 's venomous snakes , for example , came from an out-of-control homeowner , whose snakes were confiscated by the nebraska humane society a couple of years ago .	the zoo held the snakes on loan until the court ruled on the case .	some are still at the zoo today . "	we kind of feel like it 's a service to the city of omaha , " cassidy said . "	the humane society did n't have the facilities or the expertise to deal with them , let alone the anti-venom we had here . "	the zoo accepts other kinds of problem animals .	when a mountain lion roamed into town about 20 years ago , the zoo took possession on loan rather than allowing the animal to be euthanized , cassidy said .	the state of nebraska called the zoo recently about another captured cougar , asking if there was room for it .	cassidy declined the offer . "	you know , " he recalls telling them , " we 've still got the last guy that you sent us . "	animals sometimes come to the zoo on their own .	if an opossum makes its home on zoo grounds , it can become the zoo 's property .	and some animals are given sanctuary at the zoo for rehabilitation purposes .	several collared peccaries -- small pig-like creatures from the sonoran desert -- are on display inside the desert dome .	they arrived at the zoo from rehabbers in arizona .	the bald eagles and white pelicans at the zoo 's lee g. simmons conservation park and wildlife safari are also there on rehab after injuring their wings in the wild , some on power lines .	many required amputation and ca n't fly at all .	rather than leaving the birds to die in the wild , the zoo gave them a home on a pond .

the trail has gone cold more than a month after a former militia leader disappeared into western montana woods after a shootout with police , though authorities vow to nab david burgert if and when he eventually resurfaces .	missoula county authorities said they are no longer actively pursuing burgert , 47 , who led deputies on a low-speed chase june 12 near lolo , then shot at them before running into the woods .	officers are now hoping a tip or a lead comes in that will help them pinpoint burgert 's location , undersheriff michael dominick said .	there is nothing to indicate burgert is still in the area of the lolo national forest , although residents are well-versed in keeping an eye out for him , dominick said wednesday . "	he 's going to surface somewhere , " dominick said . "	we 're not going to forget about this . "	authorities called off the search more than two weeks ago after dozens of officers and cadaver-sniffing dogs spent two luckless weeks fanned out across in the woods near the idaho border .	burgert has survivalist training and authorities believe he has relied on secret stashes of food , weapons and even vehicles to stay hidden . "	he 's been out in the woods for a number of months in the past without being noticed before , " dominick said .	burgert , a former marine diagnosed with a paranoid personality disorder , once led a northwestern montana anti-government militia called project 7 .	he was convicted in 2003 of illegally possessing a machine gun and spent eight years in federal prison before being released in march 2010 .	prior to the shootout , burgert reportedly had been living in his vehicle at picnic sites and campgrounds along u.s. highway 12 .	that 's where the chase began , after deputies went to check on a vehicle that was reported parked for some time at a picnic spot .	burgert eventually stopped on a logging road and shot at the deputies , who returned fire before he grabbed gear from his jeep and ran into the woods .	no one was hurt .	even though the leads have dried up , dominick said he is confident they will eventually catch up to burgert .	dominick compared this case to the pursuit of a suspect who shot a missoula county officer in the 1990s .	it took three years , but authorities eventually apprehended the suspect . "	we do have a long memory , " dominick said .
president barack obama and russian president vladimir putin will use their meeting monday , the first since putin returned to russia 's top job , to claim leverage in a mutually dependent but volatile relationship .	obama needs russia to help , or at least not hurt , u.s. foreign policy aims in the mideast and afghanistan .	putin needs the united states as a foil for his argument that russia does n't get its due as a great power .	obama and putin are set to meet on the sidelines of the group of 20 economic gathering in mexico that will otherwise focus largely on the european economic crisis .	greece 's fate as part of the eurozone may be sealed as obama and other world leaders meet , and the gathering is a natural forum for sideline discussions of the urgent crisis in syria as well as diplomatic efforts to head off a confrontation with iran .	russia is a linchpin in several u.s. foreign policy goals .	chief among them are the international effort to deny iran a nuclear weapon and a smooth shutdown of the afghanistan war .	brutal attacks on anti-government protesters in syria and the threat of civil war in the mideast nation pose the most immediate crisis .	in the longer term , obama wants russia 's continued cooperation in nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation .	russia 's membership in numerous world bodies and its veto power at the u.n. security council give it leverage beyond its economic or military power .	obama holds far greater power and both leaders know it .	but putin can be a spoiler and irritant to the administration .	things got off to a rocky start this spring , when obama pointedly withheld a customary congratulatory phone call to putin until days after his election .	putin appeared to snub obama by skipping the smaller and weightier group of eight meeting that obama hosted last month at camp david . "	putin is in a petulant sort of mood , " said russia scholar mark n. katz of george mason university . "	he 's got all these grievances about american foreign policy and he 's looking for us to satisfy him , and i do n't think we 're going to do that .	no amount of bonhomie or talking nicely is going to fix that . "	obama made a special project of russia in his first term and arguably needs moscow 's help even more if he wins a second one .	he is trying to avoid a distracting public spat with russia during this election year , as suggested by an overheard remark to outgoing russian president dmitry medvedev in march .	obama told medvedev he would have more flexibility to answer russian complaints about a u.s.-built missile defense shield in europe after the november election .	for all obama 's talk of resetting the relationship with russia , it remains a wary standoff .	that 's apparently just the way putin prefers it .	putin 's campaign included some of the strongest anti-american rhetoric from moscow in a decade and he openly accused secretary of state hillary rodham clinton of inciting protests against him .	the obama administration mostly tried to shrug it off , but putin 's return to the presidency makes it more likely that any help russia provides in syria , iran or other matters will come at a cost .	u.s. strategy has favored flattery that may overstate russia 's influence , especially on syria , and efforts to highlight areas where u.s. and russian goals align . "	the reset with russia was based on the belief that we could cooperate with them on areas of common interest , understanding that we saw some differences , " white house deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said friday .	syria is at the top of the list of differences , especially on the question of whether the crisis can be resolved without deposing president bashar assad .	diplomatic hopes have rested on washington and moscow agreeing on a transition plan that would end the four-decade assad family rule .	russia , as syria 's longtime ally and trading partner , is seen as the best broker for a deal that could give assad political refuge .	so far , moscow has said no .	there is no formal meeting on syria scheduled at the g-20 , but u.s. and other diplomats have said they expect syria to be a main topic in other settings .	the white house tried to soften the blow of clinton 's accusation days before the g-20 meeting that russia was equipping the syrian government with attack helicopters that could bused against civilians .	she later acknowledged they were only helicopters already owned by syria that had been sent back to russia for repairs , but russia was already annoyed .	russia insists that any arms it supplies to syria are not being used to quell anti-government dissent that began more than a year ago , and has rebuffed efforts to impose an international arms embargo .	russia and syria have a longstanding military relationship and syria hosts russia 's only naval base on the mediterranean sea .	the united states has refused to arm anti-assad rebels in part to avoid a proxy fight in which iran and russia and others arm one side and the u.s. and sunni arab states arm the other .	opposition groups estimate 13,000 people have died in violence that the u.s. fears is sliding into civil war .	carney brushed aside questions about whether the u.s. might yank support for russia 's membership in world trade organization if russia refuses to help on syria .	he underscored that the u.s. supports that core russian goal , which will be a centerpiece of the talks .	the obama-putin meeting also comes the same day as moscow hosts an international negotiating session with iran .	russia has gone along with u.n. security council efforts to tighten some penalties against iran because of questions about its nuclear weapons ambitions , but has blocked the harshest punishments .	still , the united states needs russia 's participation to lend legitimacy to the argument that iran faces broad international condemnation .	iran usually paints the dispute over its nuclear program as a confrontation with the u.s. and its ally israel .	the pew research center 's newly released global public opinion survey gives putin job approval ratings obama can only dream of .	about 72 percent of russians have a favorable opinion of putin , and a majority put more faith in a strong leader than in a democratic form of government .	nearly three-quarters of those polled said russia deserves greater respect from other countries .	despite that footing , tens of thousands of protesters thronged moscow streets this past week in the first mass protest against putin since he returned to the presidency in may .	his tactics in cracking down on political opponents will make it difficult for obama to play down longstanding u.s. complaints about human rights abuses that infuriate russian leaders .	the kremlin ordered the detention and interrogation of at least one activist and searches of others ' homes last week .	putin 's own return to the presidency was far more certain than obama 's re-election chances .	despite their differences , putin probably would prefer a second obama term to a mitt romney presidency , katz said , not least because the republican challenger has called russia the chief strategic enemy of the united states .

ryan bonaminio was an iraq war veteran who once survived an attack on the dilapidated building where his army company was serving .	but death came for the 27-year-old not on a battlefield , but in a park in his hometown .	the former military policeman was gunned down just miles from his childhood home after taking a civilian job as a police officer in the southern california town where he grew up .	he was beaten with a metal weight bar and shot with his own service weapon after pleading for his life , authorities said .	thousands of officers in uniform from across the state descended upon grace community church on tuesday to pay homage to bonaminio , who enlisted in the riverside police department after tours in germany and iraq .	bonaminio was killed nov. 7 after chasing a suspect in a truck theft down a dark path and into a park , authorities said .	authorities have charged convicted felon earl ellis green , 44 , with murder and other crimes .	mourners focused on bonaminio 's life of service as they spoke at a podium positioned above his flag-draped coffin , which was brought into the riverside church by a police honor guard .	huge photos of bonaminio , including one in his uniform , hovered over the stage , flanked by rows of seated brothers-in-arms .	the dimly lit church was packed with officers and hundreds more watched the service on a giant screen in a grassy lot next door while sitting on folding chairs under the blazing sun .	police from other cities worked in riverside on tuesday so the department could attend the memorial .	military colleagues hailed bonaminio 's service as a police officer , both in riverside and as part of the army 's 314th military police company , where he earned the nickname " bondo " because his sergeant got fed up with his long last name .	he was always upbeat and boosted other soldiers ' spirits , despite sweltering temperatures in iraq and sleeping in the sand for days on end without showers , his fellow soldiers said . "	i never understood it , but if you 've ever met ryan , you understand it .	that was his way , to support me , to support the other troops that were there , " doug spencer said of bonaminio 's smile .	spencer served with him in iraq in 2003 and carpooled with him to weekend training sessions before deployment . "	we made a pact .	the pact was to come home alive , to watch each other 's backs , to help with everything ?	just to cope with everything over there .	having ryan by my side in iraq is what brought me home , " he said .	fellow soldier brook marshall recalled running into bonaminio while racing out of his room in iraq under mortar fire one night seven years ago .	bonaminio , he said , cracked a joke at the red and blue shorts marshall was wearing and cursed his own choice of footwear : flip-flops that slapped on the stairwell as they ran . "	even in the midst of a mortar attack ryan was able to maintain his sense of humor , " marshall said , reading from a journal he kept in iraq . "	no matter how bad the situation was , ryan always made the best of it . "	once bonaminio returned , he enlisted in the riverside police force , something he had always planned to do .	police who knew him lauded his courage , dedication , humility and his commitment to the community where he grew up .	chief sergio diaz urged the other officers to follow their fallen colleague 's example and never forget his sacrifice . "	ryan has taught us how to live , " diaz said , choking back tears . "	today we bury ryan 's physical body , tomorrow we take the mourning bands off our badges and we will get on with our work .	and it will be a shame on us if we pass on the opportunity to be inspired by ryan 's example . "	green will be arraigned next month after he is evaluated by a psychotherapist .	prosecutors say green fled from bonaminio when he was pulled over in a stolen big-rig and lured the officer into a park .	green then beat bonaminio with a weight bar , stole his service weapon and fired on bonaminio as he pleaded for his life , district attorney rod pacheco said .	green , of rubidoux , could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted .	bonaminio was born and raised in riverside , a city of 300,000 people about 60 miles east of los angeles .	the avid hiker and anaheim ducks hockey fan is survived by a sister , brother and parents , who thanked the officers for the outpouring of support and urged them to wear their badge with pride .	in a soft-spoken voice , bonaminio 's mother geraldine said she imagines her son looking down on the crowded church and humbly asking if all this was really for him . "	and as i look out my window , and i see a black and white rolling by , " she said , " i know ry is still protecting me . "

a proposal to help new mexico attract commercial space travel companies is speeding through the legislature .	the senate unanimously approved legislation on wednesday to protect spacecraft manufacturers along with their parts suppliers from most damage lawsuits by passengers on space tourism flights .	british billionaire richard branson 's virgin galactic plans to fly tourists into outer space at $ 200,000-a-ticket from spaceport america , near the community of truth or consequences .	a 2010 state law shields virgin galactic from being sued in most cases for damages by passengers or their families if there was an accident .	the legislation will provide similar liability limitations for the suppliers and manufacturers of spacecraft and their components .	liability restriction proposals have failed in the legislature in the past two years , but a compromise was negotiated by virgin galactic and the new mexico trial lawyers association .	under the latest measure , virgin galactic and other space companies must carry $ 1 million in insurance to qualify for the liability limitations .	supporters say the insurance coverage will help guarantee people are compensated in the few instances that damage lawsuits are allowed , such as when a spacecraft company knew there was a defect or dangerous condition or if they acted recklessly .	virgin galactic officials and spaceport promoters have said the proposed liability limitations were needed to attract companies to new mexico 's spaceport , which has cost taxpayers more than $ 200 million .	the legislation heads to the house , which is expected to approve it .
the virginia senate is delaying a vote on a bill that would allow the state to mandate the use of the electric chair if lethal injection drugs are n't available .	the senate voted 21-19 thursday to refer the bill to a committee , a move that could kill the bill 's chance of passage this session .	the house of delegates has already approved a similar bill .	death row inmates can choose their method of execution .	supporters of the measure said the shortage of drugs needed for lethal injections make it necessary to give state prison officials the ability to use the electric chair when those drugs are n't available in order to carry out death penalty sentences .	but several democratic senators said further study was needed to verify that the bill was constitutional .
republican gov. sam brownback 's plan to overhaul kansas ' individual income tax system will help the poor by creating prosperity , according to a former economic adviser to president ronald reagan who helped shaped the proposed state policy .	criticism that the plan would hurt the poor is based on a " static " analysis that does n't consider how changing tax policy will create a more dynamic economy , attracting businesses and creating new jobs , economist and supply-side economics advocate arthur laffer told the senate assessment and taxation committee thursday .	laffer , a consultant to brownback 's administration , also planned to testify before the house tax committee .	his appearance came two days after the release of state department of revenue figures that showed the proposal would increase the total income tax burden for the state 's poorest households .	as a group , kansans with adjusted gross incomes of $ 25,000 or less ?	about 41 percent of the state 's nearly 1.4 million individual income tax filers ?	would be the only one to see their aggregate taxes rise , with the biggest cut collectively going to kansans whose incomes exceed $ 250,000 .	though brownback 's administration has said any increase for the poorest group would be more than offset by social services spending , the figures have created potential political problems as the governor tries to sell his plan .	his administration has quoted laffer frequently , and it has a $ 75,000 consulting contract with the nashville , tenn. , economist .	as an adviser to reagan in the 1980s , laffer argued that lowering taxes would bring general prosperity and , through that prosperity , actually increase government revenues .	he 's known for his " laffer curve , " which represents the argument in graph form . "	your poor , your minorities , your disenfranchised , the only way you 're going to ever get them better off is by bringing jobs in , " laffer told reporters before speaking to the senate committee . "	a lot of people are using static analysis , saying by doing this you 'll make the poor worse off .	no , you 're not . "	brownback 's plan cuts individual income tax rates and exempts 191,000 operators of partnerships , sole proprietorships and other small businesses from any income taxes on their business earnings .	to offset the potential loss of revenue to the state , the plan would eliminate tax credits and deductions and keep the state 's sales tax at 6.3 percent instead of dropping it to 5.7 percent in july 2013 as scheduled .	according to the state department of revenue , as a group , the total tax burden on taxpayers with incomes of $ 25,000 or below would grow by $ 88 million , or an average of $ 156 for each .	as a group , those filers actually get a net payment from the state of almost $ 2 million , so the percentage increase in their burden is calculated at more than 5,100 percent .	critics call the plan " robin hood in reverse , " but laffer described it as " beautiful . " "	the whole reason you change the tax codes is to create a dynamic world of prosperity and growth , " he said . "	and if you can bring more jobs , more businesses , more output into this state , you will help the poor enormously . "
michael douglas is already looking forward to his next film role .	the 66-year-old actor , who has been battling throat cancer since august , tells the weekly hollywood reporter that he 'll play the title part in steven soderbergh 's " liberace , " which is set to begin shooting in may or june .	douglas says he will learn in january if his cancer has been eliminated .	doctors have told him there is an 80-percent cure rate .	he says his cancer diagnosis has brought him closer to his 93-year-old father , kirk douglas .	the two had a strained relationship for many years , but " he really made an effort " after the diagnosis , douglas says . "	he was back here almost 10 days .	he came over everyday .	he was great . "	douglas says that when he was growing up , his father was angry and often absent . "	in those key years , when kirk was doing five movies a year , if we saw him it was only out of his guilt , " douglas says .	he also acknowledges that he may have repeated that pattern with his own son , cameron douglas , 31 , who was recently jailed on drug-related charges . "	i 'm sure it 's not easy , either , being a third generation , " douglas says . "	kirk was all-consumed , was overworked .	probably like myself at a certain time in my life . "	douglas also reflects on his recent difficulties with ex-wife diandra douglas , whose bid to claim half of his earnings from " wall street 2 : money never sleeps " was dismissed in a new york court earlier this month .	he is optimistic about his recovery , and while the disease " certainly has put a little perspective on mortality , " it has also " shown me what family is , " douglas says . "	it showed me a love that i never knew really existed . "	the article appears in the issue on newsstands wednesday .
the president of the alaska cruise association on thursday labeled as reckless claims surrounding a bill that would change how the state regulates cruise ship wastewater .	john binkley told the senate finance committee that he has read reports from groups like the alaska democratic party " talking about raw sewage being dumped " into alaska waters .	binkley said cruise lines are not dumping raw sewage and have taken steps to protect alaska 's waters .	democrats said they never referred to raw sewage and binkley was mischaracterizing their statements .	in a facebook post thursday , the party said the bill would allow for the release of " partially treated sewage . "	in an email blast earlier this week , alaska democratic party chairman mike wenstrup labeled the measure " parnell 's sewage bill . "	he said the bill ?	a version of which has passed the house ?	could " legalize discharge of cruise ships ' sewage and untreated wastewater into alaska state waters . "	binkley said that 's untrue " and they 're misleading alaskans by trying to have them believe that 's the case . "	the bill , proposed by gov. sean parnell , would require that cruise ships discharge wastewater in a manner consistent with applicable state or federal law .	it would strike the more stringent requirement that discharges meet state water quality standards at the point of discharge .	it would allow mixing zones where wastewater can be diluted into the water , if ships meet certain standards for treatment of discharge .	critics say the proposal would roll back provisions of a citizen initiative requiring that cruise ships meet state water quality standards when dumping wastewater .	they also say it is n't based on the best available science .	lawmakers in 2009 passed legislation allowing the department of environmental conservation to temporarily let cruise ships have mixing zones .	commissioner larry hartig has said companies at that time were n't meeting the more rigorous standard set out by the initiative , at least for certain pollutants .	that authority is set to expire in 2015 .	last year , a science advisory panel in a preliminary report found none of the advanced wastewater treatment systems on ships operating in alaska waters could consistently meet water quality standards at the point of discharge for four " constituents of concern . "	one of the panel members , marine ecologist michelle ridgway , has testified against the bill and disagreed with some of the group 's findings .	she has said she 's worried parnell 's proposal would be a disincentive to finding better ways to treat wastewater .	julianne curry , executive director of the united fishermen of alaska , said her group has problems with the bill , too , but she said she 's also concerned with the impression the rhetoric surrounding the debate may be leaving . "	alaska 's pretty proud of our reputation here , " she said . "	it 's important we have clean water .	it 's our to our seafood industry .	it 's important to our tourism industry .	those terms being used do n't help any of us . "

a central maine town that 's a hub for a railroad whose runaway oil train derailment killed 47 people in a small quebec town is feeling the fallout from the accident .	brownville 's normally a noisy place with workers shifting railroad cars around a network of tracks in town .	but the accident that brought tragedy to lac-megantic , quebec , has brought economic hardship to brownville .	lac-megantic and brownville are connected by the rail line operated by the montreal , maine & atlantic railway , which is under investigation for the july 6 accident .	with the railroad 's tracks to quebec now cut off at lac-megantic , the trains going in that direction from brownville are no longer running .	since the accident , the railroad has laid off 67 workers in maine , 47 of whom live around brownville and nearby milo , where the railroad has a large repair shop . "	when it 's quiet , nobody is working , " richard monahan , 63 , told the maine sunday telegram ( http://bit.ly/1car0hm ) . "	this town is hurting now .	the railroad is the only thing we have here . "	many of the workers are hopeful they 'll be called back to their jobs once the connection to quebec is reopened , but the truth is that the railroad has been so damaged financially that it may take as long as two years before the rail line is functioning again , said brownville town manager matthew pineo .	the railroad 's chairman , ed burkhardt , said in a cbc radio interview wednesday that the company may not survive .	the railroad jobs , which pay from $ 2,500 to as much as $ 6,000 a month , are among the best-paid jobs in piscataquis county , a sparsely populated part of maine with low incomes and a high jobless rate .	moreover , wood product and paper manufacturers depend on rail to bring in supplies and send goods to market , pineo said .

new jersey gov. chris christie announced monday that he planned to reverse two of the line-item budget cuts democrats singled out as particularly egregious : funds used to treat sexually and physically abused children and aid for ailing cities that otherwise could n't meet payroll or debt payments obligations without crippling tax increases .	the republican governor , just back from a two-week working vacation , said at the statehouse he would support legislation that restores $ 139 million in aid to cities he cut during a spate of 11th-hour budget vetoes because of a tiff with democrats over how the funds would be administered and overseen .	then , at a news conference later in the day in newark , christie announced that $ 537,000 in federal funds would be directed to the wynona lipman child advocacy center , a newark-based treatment center for children who are victims of sexual and physical abuse .	advocates for the center said it would close without the restoration , which amounts to 75 percent of its budget . "	my commitment , and this administration 's commitment , to this type of service and treatment for children who suffer from sexual and other types of abuse has never been in question , and only those folks who are looking to score political points would question for a moment my personal commitment to this issue or our administration 's commitment to making sure it was funded , " christie said .	christie said monday that democrats left him no option but to line-item the transitional aid for cities money out of the budget after they removed a critical oversight clause . "	we have been working extraordinarily hard in the administration to change what had been basically a giveaway to cities that had been fraught with fraud , waste and abuse , " he said . "	in our ( budget ) review , it became clear the legislature ?	for whatever reason ?	had taken away the funding and language for us to provide oversight to these municipalities that had been receiving municipal aid . "	but democrats said the oversight language was never removed .	they adjusted the budget so the 1 percent administrative fee was paid by the department of community affairs , not borne by the cities receiving the aid . "	the issue he raises is completely bogus .	there is oversight .	it 's in the bill .	it 's always been in the bill , " senate president stephen sweeney said .

seventeen years after the european union shed its internal borders , the bloc remains a patchwork of national retail markets , the european commission said monday .	it said because retailers ?	from main street shops to hypermarkets selling anything over the counter and online ?	fail to take an eu-wide approach they are limiting growth at a time when europe needs it most .	the eu retail sector accounts for 4.2 percent of the eu 's gross domestic product and comprises 20 million small and mid-sized businesses .	it is an underperforming sector , said an eu report , because retailers from portugal to finland to the greek islands still cater largely to their national markets only although the eu removed its internal borders to trade in 1993 .	in a report michel barnier , the eu single market commissioner , said 35 percent of the eu 's 500 million people live in border areas that should be prime targets for competitive pricing strategies and tit-for-tat retail offers across national boundaries . "	retail services employ nearly 18 million people , " barnier said . "	we can create more economic growth by taking away difficulties that retail services face . "	one priority , he said , is reversing europe 's sluggish e-commerce sector .	cross-border delivery costs , fuzzy or costly payment systems and lack of legal redress prevent online shoppers from buying across the border .	other problems include differences in labor laws and sales promotion rules and big price gaps ?	the cost of food and nonalcoholic drinks is , on average , 28.4 percent higher in belgium than in the netherlands .	barnier plans to make specific legislative proposals to create a more integrated eu retail sector in the fall .	the european commission sees that as a crucial element of its economic strategy for the next decade which calls for annual growth of at least 2 percent .
a legislative effort to fund highway expansions and improvements by increasing the motor vehicle license tax was shelved tuesday after gov. bobby jindal announced his opposition to it .	rep. hollis downs , r-ruston , pulled his two bills ( house bills 483 and 546 ) from consideration before the house transportation committee after jindal , also a republican , pledged to fight the legislation .	as a proposed constitutional amendment , jindal could n't have vetoed the proposals , however .	it would have gone straight to voters , if it had won approval from lawmakers .	the pair of bills would have tripled the annual registration fee for cars and trucks from $ 10 to $ 30 and would have boosted registration fees on commercial vehicles as well .	the money would have been used to finance a $ 3 billion bond package to pay for 42 road construction projects in the next five years .	supporters of the bill said louisiana 's gas tax and level of highway disrepair leaves the state with no options other than to search for revenue through tax hikes .	opponents say louisianians ca n't afford tax increases in the tight economy .

a robot fish on a scientific mission shoots lasers from its nose , its tail swinging as it swims around a tank .	it 's part of an effort to showcase technology at expo 2012 , which opens for three months on may 12 in yeosu , south korea , with a theme focused on the ocean .	organizers have coined the term " seavilization " to promote the event in this southern coastal city .	it 's the first expo to be held in south korea since 1993 , and millions of visitors from around the world are expected to attend .	its formal theme is " the living ocean and coast : diversity of resources and sustainable activities . "	it 's also being billed as the biggest gathering of robots in the history of expos , and south korea hopes the event will help promote the importance of technology ?	including robots ?	to develop underwater resources without harming the environment .	in addition to the robot fish with the laser-shooting nose , there is a human-like robot that smiles , cries , frowns and winks at visitors , and at another booth , a group of robots the size of schoolchildren that dances in perfect harmony to the beat of korean pop music .	another robot that looks like a starfish crawls inside a water tank as it demonstrates its ability to detect and analyze underwater resources .	organizers hope the expo will both capture visitors ' imagination and showcase south korea 's eminence as a technology powerhouse .	other high-tech aspects will include submarines , led displays and a mobile app that allows people with smartphones to access information while touring the exhibits .	in another effort to use modern technology to draw attention to the coastal setting , yeosu has also built a gigantic round-shaped structure in the water called the big-o to display colorful hologram images .	lasers and flames shoot from the structure , which stands about as high as a 13-story building at 41 meters tall and 35 meters wide ( 135 feet by 115 feet ) .	yeosu is a port city 300 kilometers ( 187 miles ) south of seoul .	it is one of the most scenic areas on south korea 's southern coast , with 300 islands nearby .	one of its biggest tourist attractions is a wide coast , submerged daily by flood tides and rich with sea life .	the expo venue offers 2.7 million square meters of space ( 29 million square feet ) .	typically countries that join the host country for these events create pavilions to showcase their own technology , culture and products related to the expo theme .	this year 's participants are expected to come from 105 countries and 10 international organizations , organizers said .	the organizing committee said it asked north korea to participate , but pyongyang has yet to respond .	expo 2012 is a smaller exposition than the larger world 's fairs that are held in years ending in 0 and 5 .	those larger events last for six months ; the most recent large expo took place in shanghai in 2010 .	smaller expos , like the one in yeosu , are held every four years for just three months and tend to be in less well-known destinations , such as zaragoza , spain , which hosted expo 2008 .	the expos are sanctioned by the bureau international des expositions .	the next large expo will take place in milan , italy , in 2015 .
when ohio changed the way it regulated utility rates more than a decade ago , lower prices were promised to consumers .	however , a newspaper investigation shows that prices have instead gone up and the state 's one-of-a-kind mix of traditional regulations with free-market elements creates an environment that favors the industry over consumers .	a typical columbus household pays 41 percent more for electricity now than it did five years ago , an investigation by the columbus dispatch shows .	for small businesses , that 's even higher ?	they pay 51 percent more now than in 2006 .	those rates climbed three times faster than the rate of inflation over the same period .	the investigation also found that utility companies have a disproportionate amount of political power compared with the consumers they serve . "	the consumer needs to be protected from increasing rates and monopolistic utilities , " said bruce e. johnson , former lieutenant governor and republican state senator who co-sponsored the law that changed the way ohio regulates utilities . "	you would think that people would be more outrages , considering that it 's ( their ) money ?	lots of money . "	before johnson 's 1999 law was enacted , electricity bills were tied to the price of service .	if it cost $ 1 to generate power and deliver it to the customer , that consumer was charged $ 1.10 , covering the cost of service and allowing the company to profit .	that was replaced by a hybrid system that combines traditional regulations with aspects of an open market and is something unique to ohio .	the agency that enforces utility laws is the public utilities commission of ohio .	it is structured to ensure that its decisions ca n't be influenced by politics , but former employees tell the newspaper that the agency has a culture that defends the interest of utilities , sometimes at cost to the consumer .	the commission is governed by a five-member board .	despite a docket full of tough judgment calls , it supports most proposals unanimously without any debate , the newspaper reported .	since 2005 , 99 percent of all approvals have been by unanimous vote , according to the newspaper 's review of records .	an exception came last week when it cut in half a $ 600 million base rate increase requested by american electric power .	commission chairman todd snitchler said he wanted to balance the needs of all customers , and he had concerns that parts of the proposal could have violated state law .	he said the agency strives for fairness . "	we 're not here to cherry-pick favorites and do things that favor one against the other , " he said .	joe hamrock , president and chief operating officer of aep ohio , said the commission does n't favor one side over another , but instead there is " an ebb and flow " where all sides will sometimes feel like the other parties are being favored .	something that worried critics of the agency is that the $ 8.5 million budget of the state 's utility consumer advocate , the ohio consumers ' counsel , was cut by more than half .	paul duffy , who retired as the commission 's legal director last month after serving since 1975 , said the negotiated deals that the agency often uses to expedite the approval of rate increases benefit the people who sign them , which could shift costs to those who do not participate .	when the agency holds meetings , members of the public rarely show up , the newspaper reported .
bath iron works has hired a firm led by former u.s. rep. dick gephardt to improve labor relations as the shipyard and its 5,000-plus workers prepare for a stretch that includes a bidding for a coast guard contract and shoring up support for navy contracts , officials said monday .	representatives of the gephardt group met separately last week with company officials and union leaders , and they 'll be in bath this week to talk to workers , said jay wadleigh , president of local s6 of the machinists union .	bringing in a third party to resolve differences is a responsible thing to do , especially with the company at a critical juncture , wadleigh said . "	at the end of the day , we only win if we both survive , " he said .	shipyard president fred harris , who is trying to implement cost-saving measures that have rankled workers , has warned that the company may slash 1,200 jobs if it fails to win an upcoming contract for coast guard cutters .	further cause for concern is talk that the navy is considering scuttling the third and final ship in the zumwalt class , the lyndon b. johnson , a ship that already is under construction in bath , said loren thompson , a defense analyst at the lexington institute .	the 2011 budget deficit reduction law is further squeezing the navy 's shipbuilding budget , he said . "	this is not so much a reflection of the ship 's value as it is the shortage of funding for shipbuilding , " thompson said . "	this has actually been under consideration for a while now . "	cmdr. thurraya kent , a navy spokeswoman , declined to comment on reports that the navy is considering truncating the three-ship zumwalt program .	an update on the program was provided to the undersecretary for defense , acquisition , technology and logistics last month , but those discussions are confidential , she said .	a bath iron works spokesman declined to comment .	the zumwalt is the largest and most costly destroyer in u.s. navy history , with new technologies including a stealthy shape , new guns , new missile launchers , new radar system and electric propulsion .	u.s. sens. susan collins and angus king of maine said in a statement monday that it would be a policy and financial mistake to cancel a ship that already is more than 40 percent complete . "	just last week , secretary of the navy ray mabus said the navy is committed to all three ships because of the capabilities they will bring to the fleet , and we take him at his word , " they said .	capt. patrick mcnally , a spokesman for mabus , confirmed monday that the secretary still supports building all three ships .	the navy 's funding problem is why the bath shipyard , a subsidiary of general dynamics corp. , is looking to the coast guard for work .	bath iron works , which has n't built a coast guard vessel since the 1930s , wants to avoid a disaster for its workforce by outbidding two other shipyards for the next generation of " offshore patrol cutters . "	to be competitive , harris wants to have subcontractors build some items currently built in bath .	he also wants to update task lists so workers could take on new jobs .	a bulletin issued monday by the shipyard to workers encouraged them to meet with representatives of the gephardt group . "	we strongly encourage you to participate in these meetings and to provide the gephardt group with a fair , honest , and thorough understanding of your perspective , " the statement said .
fire marshal bill degnan said workers saw a piece of loose canopy near the tent 's main entrance and told the roughly 100 people inside to remain seated while they secured it .	as the winds rose , they told spectators to leave immediately and go to their cars .	the national weather service issued a severe storm warning seven minutes before the show started at 5:30 p.m. , and the tent came down at about 5:45 p.m. winds of 55 to 60 mph , with gusts up to 75 mph , were recorded in the area , and degnan said the storm cut a swath a half-mile to a mile long , taking down some trees as it neared the tent .	degnan said investigators are talking to spectators and consulting soils experts as well as structural engineers as they try to figure out why the tent fell , killing robert young , 41 , and his 8-year-old daughter , annabelle , of concord , vermont . "	robert died a hero trying to save annabelle , " trisha belliveau , the girl 's mother , told wptz-tv .	degnan said wednesday that the number of injured rose from 32 to more than 50 , mostly because several people drove themselves to a doctor and reported their injuries later .	the operator of the circus , sarasota , florida-based walker international events , said in a statement wednesday morning on its facebook page that the entire cast and crew was shocked by what had happened . "	the entire cast and crew of walker international events , inc. are deeply saddened by the tragic chain of events that occurred in lancaster , n.h. " the statement said . "	we have been reeling with the shock of these events .	our very deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families whose lives were affected .	we can not begin to express the pain and sadness we feel . "	the company has not returned repeated phone calls and emails seeking an interview .	it canceled two shows in vermont and its remaining eight shows in new hampshire .	degnan said his office is investigating whether local officials knew or should have known the show was taking place .	the show required a place-of-assembly permit , but one was not sought , degnan said .	state law says that permit should have been issued by town officials and the town would be required to make sure the tent was inspected .	the investigation is also looking at how the tent was set up . "	the bottom line is the responsibility lies with the operator , " degnan said .	he said the circus has been cooperative in the investigation .	asked if having a permit and inspection would have made a difference , degnan said " it 's hard to say . "	it was a very unusual event with some winds higher than what you 'd normally experience and it was a very isolated event , " he said .	town fire officials and the town clerk 's office referred questions to the fire marshal 's office .	degnan said authorities will review relevant laws and consult with the county attorney before deciding what , if any , charges could result from the collapse .	walker 's president , john caudill jr. , has a history of violations with the u.s. department of agriculture , primarily while operating another company , walker brothers circus inc. .	those charges are all related to animal care .	a tent manufacturer said wednesday that the large tents are designed to withstand high winds as long as they are put up correctly . "	different tents are engineered to different specifications but almost everything today is engineered to the uniform building code so chances are it was engineered to take a 70 mph wind load , " said randy mccauley , of rainier tents , a wilsonville , oregon-based manufacturer of event and other tents . "	it 's the anchoring that gives away , " mccauley said . "	ground conditions are critical when you 're setting a tent .	if you 're not paying attention to ground conditions , a tent that is n't anchored properly and that 's engineered for 70 mph might go over at 40 mph . "	the principal of annabelle young 's school said the small community of concord was rallying around the family .	the family has asked for privacy , and a state trooper was parked in front of their house wednesday . "	they 're a great family .	it 's just really tragic when you take kids to have a good time , and this is what happens , " julie donahue said wednesday , her voice breaking with tears .	donahue set up a gofundme.com page late tuesday to help the family .	as of wednesday afternoon , almost $ 9,000 had been raised toward a goal of $ 10,000 . "	everyone feels really helpless , and we just do n't understand how this could happen , " she said .

the u.s. mine safety and health administration is seeking an injunction to stop an eastern kentucky coal mine operator from interfering with safety inspectors .	the lexington herald-leader ( http://bit.ly/1oixsbu ) reports the move was spurred by an aug. 17 incident at a floyd county mine in which operator jeremy bryant allegedly screamed at inspectors and backed one against a wall while discussing a citation .	a hearing in the matter is scheduled next week before u.s. district judge amul r. thapar .	the inspectors said in a sworn statement that they feared bryant might have attacked them if his father had n't intervened .	the newspaper reports its efforts to reach bryant were n't successful .	court records do n't list an attorney for him .	a court document filed by msha says bryant is president of connor coal co. , which operates a small underground mine .	in the sworn affidavit , inspectors clarence ritchie and robert wise said bryant acted aggressively during a routine quarterly inspection , which can take several days . "	he was nose-to-nose with me while screaming , " wise said . "	i could not retreat from the confrontation because jeremy had me up against a wall . "	msha said in its motion that the safety of the inspectors would be in jeopardy without an injunction in place and if inspectors ca n't return , the safety inspection would remain incomplete .
a federal judge has granted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the los angeles police union by a former bank executive who alleged retaliation for his claims in a separate case that officers beat him .	u.s. district judge r. gary klausner ordered the dismissal of the suit against the los angeles police protective league and its president tyler izen on wednesday , finding the union 's actions " normal and expected conduct related to the ordinary process of litigation . "	an attorney representing former deutsche bank executive brian mulligan said he is reviewing the order and declined to comment .	mulligan first filed suit in 2012 , alleging he was beaten by two officers during a bizarre incident that left him with a broken nose and scapula and demanding millions in damages .	the union subsequently released an 11-minute recording in which mulligan told an officer in a nearby city two days before the incident that he 'd snorted bath salts and thought a helicopter was following him .	mulligan told the officer he bought " white lightning , " a type of bath salts , and estimates he snorted them at least 20 times , according to the tape .	a glendale police officer counseled mulligan to steer clear of the synthetic drug or his life would quickly unravel .	mulligan 's attorney called the release " mudslinging " and in a lawsuit alleged it was retaliation and a violation of his constitutional rights to seek redress for his injuries .	the judge found that there were legitimate reasons to disclose the recording given mulligan 's public allegations against the city and its officers .	the reasons include defending the officers ' reputations and protecting public confidence in the law enforcement agency .	the order said that communications about the recording , such as mulligan " will fold when he learns what we have , " simply demonstrated " an internal discussion involving the perceived weakness " of mulligan 's case .	the retaliation allegations stems from a may 15 , 2012 , incident two days after the glendale recording .	according to court documents , mulligan was stopped by two lapd officers and given a field sobriety test , which he passed .	then he was handcuffed and searched ; officers found about $ 3,000 in cash in his car .	the officers drove him to a nearby motel where he was ordered to stay until morning .	alone and with no phone to call his wife and worried he was " being set up , " mulligan eventually left the motel and ran into the same officers hours later who he alleged then severely beat him .	mulligan alleged that one officer used his baton , swinging it like a baseball bat into mulligan 's nose , then the officers beat him on the pavement .	mulligan , who had no prior criminal record , was taken to a hospital where he was kept for two days in custody .	he was arrested for investigation of resisting arrest .	county prosecutors declined to file charges , saying mulligan had been " acting crazy " and was injured after he swung and lunged at officers who restrained him .	the police commission , a civilian oversight board , found the officers ' use of force to be appropriate given the circumstances .	one of the officers named in mulligan 's case is on leave pending a disciplinary hearing for unrelated allegations that he coerced multiple women to have sex or face arrest .	a lawsuit with such allegations by a former drug informant was settled earlier this week for $ 575,000 .	bath salts are marketed as benign products that are often marked " not for human consumption . "	when smoked , snorted or injected , the white-powder drug gives users a high similar to those who take cocaine or methamphetamine .
riding the commuter train from franklin , rich clabaugh draws spooky tales about five kids who meet in a crypt and battle bullies , grave robbers and a cupcake-devouring monster .	the milford native spends the hour-long ride penciling the adventures of the young rascals who call themselves " the graveyard gang " in ghostport , mass. , in 1930s comic book america " where nightmares are for real . "	after arriving in boston , he heads to his day job as staff artist at the christian science monitor .	like the superheroes he read about as a kid , clabaugh 's lived a sort of double life .	for more than 30 years , he 's worked in production and as a designer and staff artist for several area newspapers .	yet he 's always been drawn to the visual verve and graphic elegance of vintage comic masters like will eisner who drew " the spirit " and the marvel superheroes such as captain america , spider-man and thor .	he recalled , " as a kid , i was always making up stuff and drew my own comic , ' colossal man . ' "	in douglas , where he presently lives , he 's stored his collection of more than 10,000 comics in labeled boxes in the basement .	now 49 with a daughter in high school and his son studying art in college , clabaugh has achieved " a lifelong ambition " of writing , illustrating and publishing his own comic book .	he 's launched " the graveyard gang " online and has published two complete issues and part of a third , attracting thousands of readers .	he 'll have a booth at the april 21 and 22 boston comic con , which attracts the most popular artists and thousands of fans . "	before , i was always a spectator at comic con , " said clabaugh . "	having my own booth will be a dream come true . "	anyone who got goose bumps reading " tales from the crypt " will likely enjoy how clabaugh animates the graveyard gang 's antics with offbeat humor and visual panache without the outright gore .	an admirer of milton caniff 's 1930s adventure tale , " terry and the pirates , " he strives to give the graveyard gang " the old comic strip feel " of bright , bold images , contentious characters and an imaginative story line .	clabaugh said , " i 've always loved the 1930s .	it was a time before television and computers when kids could play outside all day and get into all kinds of mischief . "	in a nod to the " our gang " comedies of old , his gang features five " misfits " ?	preston " presto " perkins , marcie mcdoogle , pasquale " buster " bonetti , sammy " sneezer " smith and lope " the wolf kid " coronado .	like the fantastic four , each kid has a more mundane skill that comes in handy during their misadventures .	presto is the brain of the gang and marcie is good with a slingshot .	buster likes to fight and sneezer 's always got a runny nose .	the gang 's leader , the wolf kid , was an orphan rescued from a freak show and he 's hairy , brave and fast .	clabaugh calls the wolf kid " my pinocchio " because he wants to be " a real boy .

in any other new england state , chelsea leyden could marry the woman she 's been with for more than two years .	but not in rhode island .	leyden hopes this is year that distinction disappears . "	i want to get married where i was born and raised , " said leyden , of cranston . "	my family is here .	i do n't want to have to go to massachusetts . "	with gay marriage bills introduced in the state 's general assembly and the house speaker calling for a vote this month , rhode island again finds itself a battleground in the national debate over same-sex marriage .	supporters eager to capitalize on recent gains elsewhere in the nation tell the associated press they 're optimistic rhode island could be the next state to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. .	voters in maine , maryland and washington passed gay marriage referendums last fall , electing to join connecticut , iowa , massachusetts , new hampshire , new york , vermont and the district of columbia in allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry .	meanwhile , in minnesota , voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage , the first time such a ballot question has failed in the united states .	the momentum has longtime supporters in rhode island feeling optimistic about their chances this year . "	there 's a wave and we should ride it , " house speaker gordon fox said the day after the november election .	fox has called for the house to vote on gay marriage before the month 's end .	rhode island state rep. art handy , d-cranston , has sponsored gay marriage legislation during 11 legislative sessions .	he was all smiles one day last week as he lobbied other house members to sign onto his bill as a co-sponsor . "	i started with this in 2003 , so i know how long it 's taken , " handy said . "	i 'm optimistic this year .	i think the speaker 's initiative to do it sooner rather than later helps . "	groups opposed to gay marriage are ready to play defense .	chris plante , director of the state chapter of the national organization for marriage , said he expects a " hard battle . "	he said fox " would n't have called for a vote so soon if he was n't sure , " he said .	nonetheless , " this is not a done deal .	we will put up a very strong fight in the house and if we 're not successful we still have a very strong fight in the senate . "	it 's likely to be months before handy knows whether his bill succeeded .	while supporters like their chances in the house , the state senate remains a challenge .	opposition to gay marriage in the senate doomed the last attempt at passing gay marriage in rhode island in 2011 .	instead , lawmakers instead voted to allow gay and lesbian couples to form civil unions granting the same state rights and benefits as marriage .	gov. lincoln chafee , a gay marriage supporter , said he 's eager for rhode island to join the rest of new england in allowing gay marriage .	he said he believes it 's not only the right thing to do but could help improve the state 's image and even its economy .	he said he knows people , gay or straight , might elect to settle in another new england state because of the state 's policy towards gay marriage . "	we want to be very inclusive , welcoming everybody , " said chafee , an independent . "	and in particular ( to the ) creative , energetic people that so often are associated with the gay community . "	rhode island now recognizes gay marriages performed elsewhere because of an executive order chafee signed last year .	the state also allows same-sex couples to create civil unions , but so far few couples have signed up .	some supporters worry the marriage legislation could get caught up in end-of-session negotiating between house and senate leaders ?	not an uncommon fate for bills that are of high interest to one chamber 's leader but perhaps not the other .	senate president teresa paiva weed opposes gay marriage but has said she expects the senate judiciary committee to take up the measure anyway if and when it passes the house .	whether the votes are there in the senate to pass the bill is an open question eagerly debated in statehouse hallways .	the senate has at least three new members that were backed by fight back ri , a political action committee created to aid candidates who back gay marriage in the state .	still , the senate has never debated or voted on gay marriage .	it 's also possible that changes to the bill 's wording ?	or proposals to hold a referendum on gay marriage ?	could complicate the political wrangling . "	it 's tough for me to predict what a vote total will look like on the senate floor , " said sen. dawson hodgson , r-north kingstown , a gay marriage supporter .	sen. harold metts , d-providence , said the senate has more important issues to focus on this year .	metts opposes gay marriage on religious grounds and said his constituents have other concerns . "	they want to know about jobs , about the economy , " he said . "	that 's where they want our focus . "	lawmakers in illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage legislation this year .
the mississippi republican party is asking federal judges to redraw the state 's four u.s. house districts before the 2012 elections .	in court papers filed this month , the party said there 's " no likelihood " that legislators will handle congressional redistricting on time .	the next regular legislative session begins jan. 3 .	that 's 10 days before the congressional candidates ' qualifying deadline for the march 13 primaries .	the u.s. justice department must approve mississippi 's new congressional maps to ensure they do n't dilute black voting strength , and the review process generally takes at least 60 days . "	there 's no time for ( legislators ) to take it up during the qualifying time , so we thought it was in the best interest of candidates for congress to have adequate time to know what their districts are going to be , " republican party chairman arnie hederman said in an interview monday .	democrat tommy reynolds of charleston , chairman of the house elections committee , said he believes it 's possible to handle congressional redistricting in a special session this fall . "	for the life of me , i ca n't see why there could n't be an agreement worked out , " reynolds told the associated press .	republican gov. haley barbour said late last month that he 'd prefer that legislators redraw the congressional districts , instead of judges .	but he said he wo n't call a special session unless there 's an agreement in hand . "	there 's no use in bringing the legislature in here to sit around and spend money when there 's no agreement , " barbour said aug. 29 .	a special session would have to take place before mid-november to give the justice department time to review any new maps , said senate elections committee chairman terry burton , r-newton .	the four congressional districts need to be balanced by population , using 2010 census numbers .	in the court papers filed sept. 12 , the republican party asks federal judges to reopen a congressional redistricting case from a decade ago .	mississippi went from five u.s. house districts to four after the 2000 census , and legislators did n't agree on a plan .	a panel of three judges approved the map that has been used since 2002 .	legislators spent weeks during the 2011 session arguing about how to redraw the 122 districts in the state house and 52 districts in the state senate , without agreeing on a plan .	they put considerably less time into discussing congressional redistricting .	with mississippi 's population of 2.9 million , each district should have 741,824 people .	according to the gop 's court filing , the 2010 census numbers showed north mississippi 's 1st district had 788,095 people , which is 6.2 percent above the ideal ; the delta 's 2nd district had 668,263 , which is 9.9 percent below the ideal ; central mississippi 's 3rd district had 756,924 , which is 2 percent above the idea ; and south mississippi 's 4th district had 754,015 , which is 1.6 percent above the ideal .	mississippi 's population is 37 percent black , and the 2nd district is mississippi 's only majority-black district .	it has been represented since 1993 by bennie thompson , the only democrat currently in the state 's congressional delegation .	reynolds and burton said they sent a letter to mississippi 's four congressmen about six weeks ago , asking for their ideas about redistricting .	reynolds said he has n't heard back from any of them .	burton said he has spoken with staff members for republican rep. gregg harper , who was elected to the 3rd district seat in 2008 .	burton said that as a practical matter , it 's important for thompson and harper to agree on the boundaries of their adjoining districts . "	anything bennie thompson does n't allow or wo n't agree to probably ca n't pass the house , and anything that gregg harper does n't allow or wo n't agree to probably ca n't pass the senate , " burton said .	the state house is controlled by democrats , and the senate is controlled by republicans .	thompson told ap on monday that legislators have the responsibility to redraw congressional districts , and he wants them to do it rather than handing the job to federal judges .	he said legislators have n't given a clear timetable for drawing new districts .	he said they should hold public hearings . "	i just do n't think four members of congress are any more important than the other citizens of our state , " thompson said . "	so , if a public process is being put forth , then let 's go with it . "	harper said he trusts the courts to work out districts that would be fair for citizens and the four members of congress . "	since early this year , i have remained in contact with state sen. terry burton regarding our discussions with our state 's other three members of congress and our inability to reach a solution on redistricting , " harper said in a written statement to ap . "	the mississippi republican party has taken this action in court to be sure that redistricting is accomplished before the qualifying deadline in january .	i believe that this is the only viable option available to them to assure that the congressional lines are drawn in a timely fashion for next year 's primary election .

the kauai fire department 's new headquarters will be getting a blessing ceremony .	the ceremony for the new headquarters at the piikoi building on rice street will be held tuesday .	the event is not open to the public .	the department expects to move from its current headquarters at the hale pumehana building on akahi street by april 2 .
thousands of iowans have been convicted of driving without a valid license and police in des moines held a courthouse sting , resulting in the arrest of 16 people .	the des moines register reported friday that almost 16,000 iowans were convicted of driving without a valid license last year .	the figure in 2006 was 19,000 people in iowa convicted of driving on a suspended , revoked , denied , canceled or barred license .	more than 310,000 license sanctions were in effect that year .	two-thirds of those sanctions were for unpaid fines and fees .	police used the sting this past week to enforce license laws .	police arrested drivers motorists for allegedly trying to drive away after having just seen a judge on charges of driving with suspended licenses .
the drop in criminal prosecutions indicates a shift for federal law enforcement agencies , which have increasingly targeted schemes aimed at mortgage lending , financial institutions and medicare , the government insurance plan for the elderly .	it suggests that people who defraud food stamps , social security or other benefits programs are less likely to face federal criminal charges .	in the two years since president obama took office , data released by the justice department show the number of criminal prosecutions for defrauding those programs has dropped by about 20 ( percent ) to its lowest point in a decade .	figures from the department 's annual reports and from trac , a research organization at syracuse university , also show a declining number of prosecutions .	last year , records show , the justice department brought 678 such cases .	criminal prosecution is typically the most significant step the government can take when it suspects fraud .	although officials can try to recover lost money and ban swindlers from receiving aid without bringing a criminal case , " as with anything else in law enforcement , if there 's a law on the books and you do n't enforce it , it becomes meaningless , " says university of maryland law professor jane barrett , a former federal prosecutor .	during the past two years , the agencies responsible for investigating fraud have referred about 8 ( percent ) fewer cases to federal prosecutors , justice department records show .	at the same time , records compiled by trac show that prosecutors have been turning down a higher percentage of the referrals they received .	former los angeles u.s. attorney thomas p. o'brien says focusing the government 's limited resources on medicare and other high-cost frauds makes sense because those schemes tend to involve far more taxpayer money . "	you have to decide what will have the biggest impact for taxpayers , " he says . "	but you also ca n't turn a blind eye to a certain area and say the government 's not going to take a very aggressive stance , " he says .	the drop in prosecutions comes as a lackluster economy has swelled the size of government benefits programs .	by last year , almost 49 ( percent ) of american households collected social security , food stamps , housing assistance or one of dozens of other forms of federal benefits , bureau of labor statistics surveys show .	food stamps alone help feed a record one in eight americans .	auditors say the risk of fraud has grown along with the size of those programs . "	when we have more people on assistance , there 's more susceptibility to people defrauding it , " says alan kimichik , the inspector general of michigan 's department of human services , which operates that state 's food stamps program .	officials have no way of knowing how much fraud costs its benefits programs each year , but the sum is certainly substantial .	auditors estimated that $ 330 million worth of food stamps were " trafficked " in 2008 , a figure that was rising as the number of people seeking aid increased .	the labor department estimated that $ 17.5 billion of unemployment insurance was lost to " improper payments " last year , though it could not say how much was because of fraud . "	some of these cases , we assume that they can deal with them administratively , " says former housing department inspector general kenneth donohue , a principal with the reznick group . "	typically , with the little cases , the u.s. attorney 's offices would not want to pursue them . "	jessica smith , a spokeswoman for the justice department , says criminal prosecutions can fluctuate over time , and officials have other tools -- including settlements and civil lawsuits -- to go after fraud .	iowa sen. chuck grassley , the top republican on the senate judiciary committee , says prioritizing the costliest schemes is important , but " no type of fraud , regardless of size or scope , should get a free pass from those sworn to uphold the laws and constitution of the united states . "	the justice department 's last major push to prosecute fraud cases came in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 , when prosecutors were instructed to take a zero-tolerance approach to people trying to cheat the aid programs intended to help rebuild the gulf coast .	they responded by bringing federal charges in thousands of cases , even when the schemes involved only a few thousand dollars , court records show .	that approach was an important tool for deterring swindlers , and it helped uncover problems in aid programs that made the abuses possible , says david dugas , the former u.s. attorney in baton rouge , who oversaw the effort .
but his enraged captors missed his more covert message : " t-o-r-t-u-r-e , " blinked into the camera in morse code , a dispatch that would alert the u.s. military to the conditions he endured .	denton , who would survive 7 ?	years confined in a tiny , stinking , windowless cell at the infamous " hanoi hilton " and other camps before his release in 1973 , died of heart problems friday in virginia beach , virginia , at age 89 , his grandson edward denton said .	the elder denton later became the first republican from alabama elected to the u.s. senate since reconstruction , though the iron will that allowed him to persevere in captivity gave rise to criticism he was too rigid a politician .	in july 1965 , a month after he began flying combat missions for the u.s. navy in vietnam , the mobile native was shot down near thanh hoa .	he was captured and recalled his captivity in a book titled " when hell was in session . " "	they beat you with fists and fan belts , " he told the los angeles times in 1979 . "	they warmed you up and threatened you with death .	then they really got serious and gave you something called the rope trick . "	the use of ropes ?	to cut off circulation in his limbs ?	left him with no feeling in his fingertips and intense muscle spasms , he said .	some of the most severe torture came after the 1966 interview , in which he confounded his captors by saying that he continued to fully support the u.s. government , " and i will support it as long as i live . " "	in the early morning hours , i prayed that i could keep my sanity until they released me .	i could n't even give in to their demands , because there were none .	it was pure revenge , " denton wrote .	the tape was widely seen , and u.s. intelligence experts had picked up the morse code message .	but denton theorized later that his captors likely figured it out only after he was awarded the navy cross ?	the second-highest decoration for valor ?	for the blinks in 1974 .	he said his captors never brought him out for another interview .	but with the war 's end drawing closer , he was released in february 1973 . "	the valor that he and his fellow pows displayed was deeply inspiring to our nation at the time , and it continues to inspire our brave men and women who serve today , " president barack obama said in a statement . "	as senator , he served as a strong advocate for our national security .	he leaves behind a legacy of heroic service to his country , and michelle and i send our condolences to the denton family . "	denton was the senior officer among former prisoners of war who stepped off a plane into freedom at clark air base in the philippines .	denton epitomized the military spirit as he spoke for the returning soldiers : " we are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances .	we are profoundly grateful to our commander-in-chief and to our nation for this day .	god bless america . "	his words and bearing , beamed back to his country by television , gave heart to the military at a time of increasing uncertainty and bitter division over the course of the war .	he was promoted to rear admiral and retired from the navy in november 1977 .	denton then turned to politics , despite having no experience running for a statewide political office .	with ronald reagan atop the republican ticket , denton became the first republican elected to the senate from alabama since the reconstruction era following the civil war .	in washington , he was a reagan loyalist , a defender of military might and an advocate for a return to denton lost his re-election bid in 1986 by only a fraction of a percentage point .	after his defeat , denton founded the coalition for decency and lectured about family causes .	denton also launched a humanitarian outreach to needy countries through his national forum foundation , which arranged shipments of donated goods . "	he was a war hero , an honorable senator , and a family man who cared deeply about his country , " said a statement from u.s. sen. richard shelby , who denton in 1986 .	denton 's grandson , edward , said that on one hand , denton was a normal grandfather who enjoyed taking his grandchildren fishing aboard his boat in mobile . "	on the other hand , " he said , " he was a war hero and someone who set an example for being what being a good , patriotic american is all about . "

the two independent candidates running for massachusetts governor have little name recognition but could still play a critical role in next year 's election .	while the candidates and their supporters say they are running to win , they could also act as political spoilers ?	peeling away key votes from either the democratic or republican nominee .	democrats are keeping an eye on evan falchuk , a 44-year-old newton resident running for governor under the self-styled united independent party label .	falchuk , a lawyer and former head of best doctors inc. , a boston-based global health company , describes himself as " pragmatically progressive and fiscally sensible . "	he 's staked out liberal positions , including breaking up what he calls the " monopolistic practices " of large insurers and big hospitals as a way to lower health care costs .	he 's also plowed about $ 300,000 of his own money into his campaign .	another well-heeled candidate could pose problems for republicans .	jeffrey mccormick , the founder of the venture capital investment firm saturn partners , has opened a campaign account with the office of campaign and political finance and is expected to formally enter the race early next year .	the 52-year-old mccormick has n't been talking to reporters , but the boston resident has already pumped $ 100,000 of his own money into his campaign account .	one of mccormick 's early backers is former state treasurer joe malone , a longtime republican who just recently announced he 's enrolling as an independent .	thomas whalen , a political historian and author at boston university , said the hurdles to victory are high for independent candidates in massachusetts .	even without the political infrastructure of an established party behind them , they can still use the platform of a gubernatorial campaign to drive home a political viewpoint or idea .	and even if they only pick up a tiny slice of the electorate , that can spell victory or defeat for either of the top party candidates in a tight election , he added . "	certainly falchuk has a pretty progressive stance , " whalen said . "	if he gets any kind of traction politically , it could eat into the margins of whoever is the democratic nominee and throw the race to the republican . "	mccormick could have the reverse effect , pulling votes from presumed republican front-runner charlie baker , whalen said . "	baker knows better than anyone the danger of a third-party candidate , " whalen said .	in 2010 , former democratic state treasurer timothy cahill ran as an independent candidate .	he got only 8 percent of the vote but was seen as a drag on baker , who lost to democratic gov. deval patrick , who was running for a second term .	for falchuk and mccormick , the goal is n't to be a spoiler but to win .	falchuk said voters are sick of the kind of party squabbling that shut down the federal government this year . "	you hear all the time that people are voting for the lesser of two evils , and that is not what the democratic process should look like , " falchuk said , adding that there 's tremendous interest in getting out of what he called the " left-right rut . "	falchuk said the spoiler question is insulting to voters ?	pointing out that more than half of massachusetts voters are n't enrolled in any party . "	voters kind of resent the idea that they 're supposed to be democratic or republican voters , " he said . "	every candidate has the responsibility to go out and earn the support and ultimately the vote of each individual voter .	every candidate should be held to that standard . "	malone said he 's known mccormick since the mid-1990s and has been impressed by his energy and vision and dedication to helping create jobs ?	pointing to mccormick 's investment in companies like the email marketer constant contact and the boston duck tours . "	his passion now is to get into government and use the same kind of skill set to improve people 's lives , " malone said . "	to me , that 's exciting . "	like falchuk , malone also brushed off the spoiler label , saying mccormick will be able to raise the kinds of issues that party candidates might shun . "	i think the added competition is good for the state , is good for voters , " malone said . "	why should we be limited to just two candidates ? "	there 's no shortage of party candidates eyeing the state 's top political office .	democratic gubernatorial hopefuls include state treasurer steven grossman , attorney general martha coakley , newton pediatrician don berwick , former federal homeland security official juliette kayyem and former wellesley selectman joseph avellone .	shrewsbury business owner mark fisher is challenging baker for the gop nomination .

for the first time with hair that 's brown instead of a wild shade of orangish-red , the suspect in colorado 's movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead appeared in court thursday as prosecutors gave up their fight to see a notebook he sent to a university psychiatrist , saying they did n't want to delay proceedings .	holmes appeared more animated during the hearing .	he smiled and glanced around the courtroom , looking at his lawyers and reporters covering the hearing .	he appeared to be moving his mouth but not actually talking .	defense attorneys say holmes is mentally ill and that the notebook , sent to dr. lynne fenton , should n't be released because of doctor-patient privilege .	fenton last saw holmes professionally on june 11 before seeing him again in court on aug. 30 .	prosecutors argued that the notebook and its contents are fair game .	he planned to be dead or in prison after the shooting rampage at an opening night showing of " the dark night rises , " they said , and had no plans to undergo therapy .	but deputy district attorney rich orman said even if prosecutors convinced the judge the notebook is n't protected , defense attorneys would likely appeal the decision . "	we still think we have good and compelling evidence that the notebook should not be privileged , " orman said , adding that because of possible delays , " we 're not asking to look at it . "	if holmes ' mental health becomes an issue in the case , orman said holmes would have to waive privilege and prosecutors likely would gain access to the notebook , which remains in the custody of the court .	arapahoe county district judge william b. sylvester approved a procedure for holmes ' defense team to examine the notebook , which includes having a police officer present in the room . "	his notebook , his sketches , his drawings , everything should be made public so we can learn from it and prevent this from happening again , " said greg medek , of aurora , whose daughter micayla , 23 , died in the shooting . "	he 's just putting on a show .	i do n't think he 's crazy .	he 's just evil . "	holmes has been charged with 142 counts , including murder and attempted murder , stemming from the july 20 attack at an aurora theater that killed 12 and wounded 58 others .	judge sylvester on thursday approved prosecutors ' request to add 10 additional attempted murder charges and amend 17 others .	documents released thursday show names were changed or corrected on some charges .	the hearing was cut short by the prosecution 's decision not to seek the notebook , which purportedly contains descriptions of a violent attack .	former denver prosecutor karen steinhauser said prosecutors want the notebook to bolster their case that the shooting was deliberately planned and carried out by a sane person .	but should holmes plead insanity , prosecutors would have the right to materials , including the notebook , which the examining psychiatrist would have used to form a professional opinion about holmes ' sanity .	if holmes is considered mentally ill , but competent to stand trial , the notebook could remain off limits to the prosecution .	steinhauser also said prosecutors might be able to gain access to the notebook through an " implied waiver " of privilege should holmes talk about its contents to inmates or jail guards . "	they ( prosecutors ) believe they will ultimately have access to that notebook , " said steinhauser , who is also a law professor at the university of denver . "	they want to keep this case moving . "
a richmond , va. man has pleaded guilty in a $ 1.2 million investment scheme .	stephen maurice burks faces a maximum of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced by u.s. district judge robert payne on feb. 20 .	the 64-year-old burks pleaded guilty tuesday to mail fraud .	burks was chief executive officer of chelsea financial group .	in a statement of facts filed with the plea agreement , burks said he sold investments in stocks , oil , payday lending franchises , foreign currency exchange trading and group homes .	he admitted lying to investors about his background and failing to inform them that he was a convicted felon .	burks obtained at least $ 1.2 million from investors and failed to disclose that he kept at least 25 percent for personal use .
tamarack resort 's owner said wednesday he has finally chosen a buyer , a move that could kick off additional bidding for the bankrupt development whose fortunes rose and plunged with the real-estate mania of the last decade .	jean-pierre boespflug said he selected eagle , idaho-based green valley holdings , which has offered $ 40 million for the resort 90 miles north of boise .	green valley includes larry givens , an idaho construction company owner , and pension fund consultant matthew hutcheson .	givens and his sons , scott and rod givens , who are the co-ceos of the investor group , did not attend the news conference wednesday .	a tamarack representative said they were traveling .	boespflug , the french-born developer who for a decade has been the public face of tamarack , told the associated press that givens , hutcheson and their investor group made the strongest proposal among three he 's been considering .	he plans to submit their bid as a so-called " stalking horse " motion to u.s. bankruptcy judge terry myers in mid-january .	if myers approves , other potential buyers could then submit additional bids to gain control of the property . "	that 's when we begin overbidding , " boespflug said . "	completion of the transaction will leave me with the feeling of turning the page completely . "	boespflug said he hopes to complete the transaction by april 30 .	myers must sign off on any deal , which includes a $ 1.6 million loan from green valley to help tamarack complete the transaction .	the offer appears to have beaten out two other investment companies that have expressed interest in tamarack : pelorus group , a salt lake city company that bought tamarack 's conference center this summer , and jma ventures , a san francisco real-estate developer that already owns two ski resorts in california and one in montana .	neither company returned phone calls or e-mail messages from the ap seeking comment .	still , the proposed transaction would reap just a fraction of the more than $ 350 million owed creditors , including lenders led by zurich-based credit suisse group , who were stiffed by tamarack when the vacation real-estate market collapsed starting in 2007 and boespflug could n't muster up additional cash .	some , including contractors who built tamarack during its heyday , will receive only a fraction of their claims .	others will get nothing .	a credit suisse spokesman did n't immediately comment .	boespflug estimates he 's lost $ 45 million on tamarack , while two of his minority partners , jerry barnett and richard getty , both of gig harbor , wash. , sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in july , declaring hundreds of millions in assets and liabilities , according to court records .	green valley 's bid for tamarack does n't include two ski lifts owned by bank of america corp. 's leasing division or the osprey meadows golf course , all of which are subject of million-dollar litigation and would likely have to be acquired separately .	in 2004 , tamarack opened amid frenzied sales of lots , condos and chalets that would have brought in more than $ 500 million , had the deals been completed .	president george w. bush vacationed here in 2005 with idaho 's governor , while tennis star andre agassi planned to build a luxury hotel .	then , boespflug ran out of money and could n't repay credit suisse ?	or finish tamarack 's village plaza , the resort 's condo-and-commercial centerpiece that , at 60 percent complete , now stands as an insulation-wrapped monument to the ambitions of investors who briefly transformed idaho 's valley county into a booming property speculation mecca .	the subsequent implosion has left the rural , construction-dependent region with 20 percent unemployment .	some of those jobless residents are now back working at tamarack , where a homeowners group has helped bankroll a ski season after persuading the bankruptcy judge to let them use lifts and other equipment that had been mothballed in march 2009 and went unused last winter .	about 900 skiers hit the slopes monday , the season 's opening day .
could the dow set a record high next year ?	that question would have seemed crazy early last year when fear and panic enveloped the stock market and the dow jones industrial average plunged to 6,547 on march 9 .	many investors thought it would take a decade or longer to get back to the record of 14,165 , set on oct. 9 , 2007 .	now we could be on the verge .	the dow has soared 76 percent the past 21 months , and it would have to climb just 23 percent from friday 's close of 11,492 to set a record .	that 's a big jump , but the dow has risen 23 percent or more six times since 1985 , or roughly 1 in 4 years .	two other years , the dow just missed with a gain of 22.6 percent .	add them and the number becomes eight years out of 25 , or roughly 1 in 3 .	many analysts do n't expect a 23 percent gain in 2011 , but they agree conditions are in place for the rally to continue . "	there are some really compelling reasons out there that say the dow could approach its highs , " says randy bateman , chief investment officer for huntington asset advisors . "	you 've got a fairly rosy scenario , where there is n't a whole lot of competition for stocks . "	corporate bonds provide decent income but lack the potential of stocks to appreciate .	interest rates on cash investments , such as bank cds and money market mutual funds , remain in the basement .	meanwhile , corporate earnings keep rising , which makes stocks more appealing .	companies also are sitting on a record amount of cash , giving them leeway to pay bigger dividends , buy their own stock or buy competitors .	the economy could help , too .	the great recession ended in june of last year , so this economic expansion is only one and a half years old .	expansions since world war ii have lasted an average of nearly five years .	the dow does n't always rise the year a recovery marks its second anniversary .	but the last time it did so , in 2003 , the dow jumped 25 percent .	this expansion has been fitful so far .	if it finally gains traction next year , stocks could do well .	the dow has already had a good run this year .	it 's up 10 percent despite serious problems lingering in the economy , including a 9.8 percent unemployment rate and a weak housing market .	part of the reason is that stock investors focus more on what 's ahead than what 's happening now .	they believe the economy will continue to heal next year and companies will keep earning more money .	on friday , investors got the latest sign that the economy is on the mend .	the conference board 's index of leading economic indicators rose last month at the fastest pace since march .	here 's a look at how the dow made a leap of more than 23 percent six times the past 25 years : ?	1985 .	a third straight year of strong economic growth ?	gdp grew 4.1 percent ?	after a deep recession had ended in november 1982 fueled a 28 percent gain in the dow .	the inflation rate remained stable a fourth straight year , convincing many investors that the inflation monster of the late 1970s had been slain . ?	1989 .	mergers and acquisitions , including takeovers by corporate raiders , helped push the dow up 27 percent .	kohlberg kravis roberts & co. 's purchase of rjr nabisco was the largest corporate deal the country had seen .	in august , the dow regained the level it had reached in august 1987 , two months before that year 's " black monday " crash . ?	1995 .	the dow jumped 33 percent as what would become the longest economic expansion in u.s. history powered through its fifth year .	and more americans were putting money into stocks through 401 ( k ) accounts .	the number of households owning stocks jumped to 41 percent , up from 37 percent in 1992 and 32 percent in 1989 , according to the federal reserve . ?	1996 .	the dow rose another 26 percent as the economy continued strong .	stocks gained so much that federal reserve chairman alan greenspan asked in a speech in december whether " irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values . " ?	1999 .	strong corporate profits and excitement about the internet pushed the dow up 25 percent .	earnings per share for the companies in the s&p 500 index jumped 28 percent , the strongest growth since 1994 . ?	2003 .	the dow rose 25 percent as the economy enjoyed its second year of recovery after the 2001 recession .	the federal reserve cut short-term interest rates as low as 1 percent to encourage growth .	the two years the dow rose 22.6 percent were 1986 and 1997 .	each followed one of the strong years above as strong economic conditions continued .	many analysts expect corporate profits will keep rising ?	and stock prices with them ?	but not at a rate that would send the dow past 14,000 next year .	bank of america merrill lynch , for example , expects earnings per share for the big companies in the standard & poor 's 500 index to rise 9 percent in 2011 and 6 percent in 2012 .	it sees the s&p rising 13 percent in 2011 from friday 's close . "	nothing 's impossible , but it 's not real probable , " says bob millen , a portfolio manager of the jensen portfolio mutual fund .	even huntington 's bateman , who says the dow could reach a record in 2011 , warns stocks may not stay that high for long .	larger government deficits , he says , could drive stock prices lower in 2012 or 2013 .

law enforcement officials have responded to a record number of suspected meth labs across the state .	the number was 51 as of friday , compared with 37 in all of last year .	maine 's meth lab activity is five times higher than that of other new england states , but most of the meth labs are small operations serving a small number of users , and the number of people seeking treatment for meth is growing at a slow rate , said roy mckinney , director of the maine drug enforcement agency .	the problem pales in comparison to heroin abuse , but the state always responds forcefully because the chemicals used to make meth raise the possibility of fires and explosions . "	it is a high priority because of the danger to public safety and health , " mckinney said . "	we 've found them in apartment buildings and homes .	the danger and risks associated with it mandates that we do aggressively pursue these . "	gov. paul lepage has been pressing for more drug agents .	he had set a dec. 10 deadline for the legislature to convene for a special session to provide funding to hire 10 more , but the republican governor appears to have backed off slightly .	instead , he told lawmakers he wants assurances that they 're willing to address the hiring of agents " out of the gate " when they return in january .	democratic and republican legislative leaders have expressed a willingness to fund additional drug agents as part of a multipronged approach that includes treatment and prevention options .	every time there 's a meth lab bust , resources are taken away from other investigations because agents must travel to the site and don protective suits and breathing apparatus , said steve mccausland , spokesman for the maine department of public safety .	but drug agents are n't letting meth lab operators off the hook .	when a meth lab is identified , agents launch an investigation to identity everyone involved in the investigation , even those who bought ingredients like cold packs , pseudoephedrine and lithium batteries . "	sometimes we 'll have multiple arrests associated with one lab incident , rather than just bring a case against the person doing the ' cooking . '	we go after everyone involved in that conspiracy , " mccausland said .	in the big picture , abuse of heroin , fentanyl and other opiates has overshadowed meth , and with good reason .	the number of overdose deaths increased from seven in 2009 to 57 in 2014 , and maine is on track for a record number this year .

the 43-year-old pilot says allegiant is putting profits above safety .	allegiant says the evacuation was unnecessary and put passengers at risk -- several were injured sliding down inflatable escape chutes .	the incident in june was one of many over the summer that brought unflattering attention to allegiant .	the teamsters union , which is trying to negotiate allegiant pilots ' first union contract , has publicized the events and accused the airline of cutting corners on safety .	the case highlights a natural tension in the airline industry : captains are responsible for safety on the plane , but airlines can and do judge their work .	on june 8 , jason kinzer was the captain of an allegiant air jet with 141 passengers scheduled to fly from st. petersburg , florida , to hagerstown , maryland .	minutes after takeoff , kinzer says , flight attendants called the cockpit to report smelling smoke , so he declared an emergency and returned to the airport .	kinzer said he rolled to the end of the runway , where the plane was met by emergency vehicles .	according to a transcript of airport radio transmissions , a fire-and-rescue worker detected smoke coming from one of the two engines on the mcdonnell douglas md-80 .	kinzer told airport officials he planned to evacuate the plane .	on the recording , someone can be heard telling the pilot to wait , but the person did n't identify himself or give a reason for the delay .	kinzer then ordered passengers to evacuate .	several passengers and one flight attendant were injured , allegiant reported at the time .	in a july 23 termination letter , allegiant chief pilot mark grock told kinzer that he " ordered an evacuation that was entirely unwarranted and ... compromised the safety of your crew and your passengers and led directly to the injuries . "	kinzer said he first learned of his dismissal in an earlier phone call during which a personnel staffer said he was being fired because the flight was one of several incidents that brought negative attention to allegiant .	he did not record the call , and allegiant spokeswoman kimberly schaefer disputed that the airline would fire someone over an issue of " public perception . "	she said terminations are made only after thorough investigations .	the company " values the safety of our passengers and crew above all else , " schaefer said . "	allegiant is a safe airline . "	evacuations are expensive for airlines .	allegiant declined to say how much it cost to reinstall the emergency chutes on kinser 's plane , but after a jetblue flight attendant intentionally deployed a slide in 2010 , a police report said replacing the chute cost more than $ 25,000 -- that was one slide on a much smaller plane than kinser 's md-80 , which had four slides .	in an interview this week , kinzer , who joined allegiant in january 2013 , said the airline 's own operations manual calls for evacuation in case of a potential fire . "	i have not had a moment of remorse over this , " he said . "	no aviator should ever feel the fear of retribution ... ( for ) doing something in the interest of safety . "	bryan dougherty , a passenger , said once the captain gave the evacuation order , " it was pure mayhem .	everybody was pushing everybody . "	he said an older woman who was pushed down a chute by a flight attendant wound up going to the hospital .	dougherty said he did n't smell smoke before the evacuation but that others sitting in the back of the plane did .	he did n't think it was necessary to use emergency slides , but added , " i 'm no airline expert . "	the wrongful-termination lawsuit was filed tuesday in state court in las vegas , where parent allegiant travel co. is based .
authorities have arrested two men for scams targeting south florida 's haitian-american community .	florida chief financial officer jeff atwater said last week that jacques albert calixte used his miami charity haitian american association against cancer to steal nearly $ 300,000 in state funds intended to help screen haitian-american women for cancer .	authorities say calixte provided false documents to receive payments between 2011 and 2013 .	earlier this month , florida 's office of financial regulation announced that philippe bourciquot allegedly used haitian creole radio ads to lure listeners into a ponzi scheme .	investigators said bourciquot had bilked roughly $ 3.1 million from over 300 investors since november 2012 .	miami-dade county jail records did n't show whether either man had an attorney .	calixte was held monday on $ 90,000 bond , and bourciquot was held on $ 200,000 bond .
president barack obama appealed for civility at a wednesday memorial service for those attacked in the arizona shooting rampage and implored a divided america to honor them by becoming a better country .	obama electrified the crowd by revealing that following his wednesday hospital visit with rep. gabrielle giffords , she had opened her eyes for the first time since being shot point-blank in the head in the assassination attempt four days ago .	first lady michelle obama held hands with giffords ' husband , mark kelly , as the news brought a cascade of cheers .	obama conceded that there is no way to know what set off saturday 's shooting rampage that left six people dead , 13 others wounded and the nation shaken .	he tried instead to leave indelible memories of the people who were gunned down and to rally the country to use the moment as a reflection on america 's behavior and compassion . "	i believe we can be better , " obama said to a capacity crowd at the university of arizona basketball arena ?	and to countless others watching across america . "	those who died here , those who saved lives here ?	they help me believe .	we may not be able to stop all evil in the world , but i know that how we treat one another is entirely up to us . "	obama said giffords , known as " gabby , " opened her eyes a few minutes after he left her intensive care hospital room wednesday evening at tucson 's university medical center , where some of her colleagues in congress remained . "	gabby opened her eyes , so i can tell you : she knows we are here , she knows we love her , and she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey , " he said .	three of her giffords ' close female friends in congress were there : house democratic leader nancy pelosi , rep. debbie wasserman schultz and sen. kirsten gillibrand .	giffords is expected to survive , although her condition and the extent of her recovery remain in doubt .	as finger-pointing emerged in washington and beyond over whether harsh political rhetoric played a role in motivating the attack , obama sought to calm the rhetoric . "	the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us , " he said .	obama 's appeal for civility played out against a deepening political debate .	earlier in the day , republican sarah palin , criticized for marking giffords ' district and others with the cross-hairs of a gun sight during last fall 's campaign , had taken to facebook to accuse pundits and journalists of using the attack to incite hatred and violence .	obama spoke to a crowd of more than 13,000 in the arena and thousands more listened on from an overflow area in the football stadium .	not far away , at university medical center , giffords lay fighting for her life .	obama also met with other victims there .	obama faced the expectation to do more than console , to encourage civility , all without getting overly political in a memorial service .	he challenged americans to engage in a debate that is worthy of those who died .	he tapped into the raging debate about the role of incendiary political speech without dwelling on it . "	let 's remember that it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy .	it did not , " the president said .	no matter the cause of the shooting , obama pleaded for americans to remain civil now as they debate gun control , mental health services and the motivations of the killer . "	at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized ?	at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do ?	it 's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals , not a way that wounds , " the president said .	the shooting happened saturday as giffords , a three-term democrat who represents southern arizona , was holding a community outreach event in a tucson shopping center parking lot saturday .	a gunman shot her in the head and worked his way down the line of people waiting to talk with her , law enforcement officials said .	the attack ended when bystanders tackled the man , jared lee loughner , 22 , who is in custody .	obama 's speech , by turns somber and hopeful , at times took on the tone of an exuberant pep rally as he heralded the men who wrestled the gunman to the ground , the woman who grabbed the shooter 's ammunition , the doctors and nurses who treated the injured , the intern who rushed to giffords ' aid .	the crowd erupted in multiple standing ovations as each was singled out for praise .	the president ended up speaking for more than half an hour , doubling the expected length of his comments .	after offering personal accounts of every person who died , obama challenged anyone listening to think of how to honor their memories .	he admonished against any instinct to point blame or to drift into political pettiness or to latch onto simple explanations that may have no merit .	memories of the six people killed dominated much of obama 's speech .	the president , for example , recalled how federal judge john roll was on his way from attending mass when he stopped to say hello to giffords and was gunned down ; dorothy morris , shielded by her husband , but killed nonetheless ; and phyllis schneck , a republican who liked giffords , a democrat , and wanted to know her better .	he spoke at length of 9-year-old christina taylor green , the only girl on her baseball team , who often said she wanted to be the first woman to play in the major leagues .	she had just been elected to the student council at her elementary school and had an emerging interest in public service .	obama was again playing the role of national consoler that comes to all presidents and , in rare times , helps define them .	recent history recalls george w. bush with a bullhorn amid the rubble of the sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks ; bill clinton 's leadership after the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 , and ronald reagan 's response to the explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , when he spoke about being " pained to the core . "	obama drew on his own somber experience , following the shooting rampage by one of the military 's own members at the fort hood , texas , army post in 2009 , which left 13 people dead and more than two dozen wounded .	earlier wednesday , details of the attacker 's activities ahead of the assassination attempt were disclosed .	before the saturday shooting , loughner went shopping at a megastore , was pulled over for running a red light and ran from his father after an angry confrontation after two shopping trips to walmart , loughner ran a red light but was let off with a warning , the arizona game and fish department said .	the officer took loughner 's driver 's license and vehicle registration information but found no outstanding warrants and did n't search the car .	earlier that morning , a mumbling loughner ran into the desert near his home after his father asked him why he was removing a black bag from the trunk of a family car , sheriff 's officials said .	he resurfaced later saturday at a grocery store where giffords was holding an event .	there , authorities say , he shot 19 people .	police records at pima community college in tucson released wednesday detailed loughner 's increasingly bizarre behavior last year , culminating with his suspension in september .	the 51 pages of campus police reports , obtained under an open records request , described a series of classroom outbursts and confrontations that prompted worried instructors to summon campus officers .	in a poetry class , he made comments about abortion , wars and killing people , then asked : " why do n't we just strap bombs to babies ? "	police previously told the ap they also found notes with the words " die , bitch " , which they believe referenced giffords , and " die , cops . "	giffords , 40 , was less sedated and more responsive and her doctors said that her recovery was going as anticipated .	back in washington , giffords ' house colleagues praised her and the other shooting victims and insisted that violence would not silence democracy .

alabama house speaker mike hubbard was arrested monday on felony ethics charges , accused of using his public offices for personal gain .	acting attorney general van davis said a special lee county grand jury indicted hubbard on 23 charges accusing him of misusing his office as speaker and his previous office as chairman of the alabama republican party .	hubbard was processed monday afternoon at the lee county jail and released on $ 86,000 bond , sheriff jay jones said .	hubbard said the charges , coming two weeks before the general election in which he 's widely favored for re-election , constitute " a political witch hunt . "	the 52-year-old republican is considered one of alabama 's most powerful politicians and led the gop 's takeover of the legislature in 2010 , ending 136 years of democratic control .	the state attorney general 's office convened the special lee county grand jury in 2013 to investigate possible government corruption .	attorney general luther strange stepped aside from the investigation and named davis , a former district attorney , to lead it .	in davis ' appointment letter , strange said hubbard was the focus of the grand jury , and hubbard had been preparing in recent days for his possible arrest . "	his mood is comfortable , confident determined , ready to go battle , " defense attorney mark white said .	the indictment is a dark chapter in the career of the lee county legislator , who rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the state .	hubbard was first elected to the alabama house of representatives in 1998 .	he was elected chairman of the alabama republican party in 2007 and 2009 .	he lashed out at what he called montgomery 's " culture of corruption " as he led republicans ' 2010 takeover of the alabama legislature , ending 136 years of control by democrats .	he left his party leadership role when the house elected him speaker after the 2010 election .	some of the charges accuse hubbard of using his party chairmanship to secure business for his media and printing companies in auburn , and others accuse him of using his legislative position to benefit one of his companies , the auburn network , through work with the alabama pharmacy cooperative inc. , southeast alabama gas district and others .	other charges accuse him of soliciting things of value from lobbyists , including former gov. bob riley , riley 's daughter , minda riley campbell , and business council of alabama president billy canary .	riley did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment .	hubbard faces arraignment dec. 3 .	if convicted , hubbard faces from two to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 300,000 on each count .	the democratic minority leader in the house , craig ford of gadsden , said the investigation is not politically motivated because the attorney general is a republican like hubbard . "	it is sad to see that , in less than four years , our leaders have embraced the culture of corruption that they ran against in 2010 , " he said .	senate president pro tem del marsh of anniston , who helped hubbard engineer the gop takeover in 2010 , said he has always considered hubbard to be a man of integrity and still does . "	i would hope everyone reserves judgment until we have all the facts , " he said .	hubbard said he 's not worried about the charges or whether they will impact his race nov. 4 against democrat shirley scott-harris of auburn . "	i 'm sleeping well at night because i know the people of lee county can see this for what it is and that 's politics at its worst , " hubbard said after his arrest .	hubbard is the third politician affected by the lee county probe .	rep. barry moore , r-enterprise , is scheduled to go to trial oct. 27 on perjury charges .	prosecutors have accused moore of lying to the grand jury when he denied telling primary opponent josh pipkin that hubbard had threatened to hold up economic development funds if pipkin stayed in the race .	moore has pleaded not guilty .	republican greg wren of montgomery resigned from his house seat in april after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor ethics charge .	he admitted taking actions in the legislature that could have steered a company partially owned by american pharmacy cooperative while he was doing work for a company connected to the bessemer-based firm .	the charges are latest corruption allegations against alabama politicians to make headlines .	several state senators and lobbyists were acquitted on vote-buying charges in 2012 .	former two-year college chancellor roy johnson in 2008 pleaded guilty to bribery charges .	a federal grand jury in 2006 convicted former gov. don siegelman of selling a health board appointment to healthsouth founder richard scrushy in exchange for campaign donations .

pakistan 's devastating floods have interrupted delivery of food aid to neighboring afghanistan that would have fed about a million people this winter , the u.n. world food program said monday .	many people in rural areas of impoverished , war-ravaged afghanistan risk starvation , and the poorest subsist on bread and tea through the long , harsh winter .	the world food program normally tries to move its aid there in autumn , before winter weather blocks mountain roads for months .	the agency had planned to supply about 3.8 million people with food in november .	but about 16,000 metric tons of afghan-bound wheat were in warehouses in neighboring pakistan awaiting customs clearance when the country was engulfed in floods , said challiss mcdonough , a spokeswoman for the organization .	the warehouses were swamped by water about 10 feet deep .	another 6,000 metric tons was diverted to feed pakistanis who have no food because of the flooding , she said . "	that means 22,000 metric tons of wheat that we were counting on having in afghanistan right now simply is n't here , " mcdonough said . "	we have enough for this month , but will start running short in november , and the situation will be really critical in december . "	winter snows start cutting off roads in much of mountainous afghanistan in late october or early november .	the world food program typically sends a full winter 's worth of food out to those areas that get blocked by snow about this time of year . "	if we can not get food into those areas before the roads close , we wo n't be able to reach those people until spring , or in some places early summer , " mcdonough said . "	so a shortage now can continue affecting people for months . "	while food can be helicoptered in , it is so expensive that the agency reserves that only for the most dire cases , mcdonough said .	the wheat lost to pakistan 's floods was insured but takes time to replace .	purchases typically take about three to four months to arrange , mcdonough said .	the agency is trying to buy some of afghanistan 's wheat crop , it will be difficult to get even that in time , she said .	they have put out bids for about 10,000 metric tons of afghan wheat .	the agency plans to prioritize the wheat that it does have to make sure it goes to the neediest people ?	victims of natural disasters or people left homeless by conflict , she said .	the first programs to get cut will be those that give food as payment to day laborers .	the idea behind the programs is that they target the poorest people in a community by default , as they are the ones most willing to work for food alone .	also likely to be cut will be programs that give food to families in exchange for the man of the household letting his wife take classes in literacy or marketable skills like tailoring or beekeeping .	some supplies survived the flood ?	vegetable oil for example was salvaged even after being submerged in water .	the agency said recent blockades of military supplies from pakistan have not kept it from being able to ship these supplies in .	commercial trucks and humanitarian cargo are still being allowed through and mcdonough said five wfp trucks crossed the border sunday , with another 15 expected to cross monday .	about 80 percent of the agency 's food aid for afghanistan typically passes through pakistan .
a southern california wildfire that 's burned 11 square miles of brush and more than 100 small buildings is well on its way to being surrounded , and the last evacuations it brought have been called off .	state fire officials say the blaze near julian in san diego county is 85 percent contained thursday night as cooler weather has prevailed .	the blaze burned 120 structures , mostly cabins at a shriners camp in the cleveland national forest on monday .	about 30 people had been evacuated at the fire 's peak earlier in the week , but evacuation orders were called off for most areas wednesday night and the remaining evacuations were canceled thursday night .	about 1,600 firefighters are battling the blaze .	seven were treated for heat exhaustion or minor injuries .
new york inspector general joseph fisch said friday the corruption probe showing politics and money dominated the selection of a later disqualified " racino " operator for the aqueduct racetrack tops all his other investigations for the sheer number of high-ranking officials involved .	the 77-year-old former judge , prosecutor and investigator has busted crooked cops , city officials and mobsters during a 50-year career .	but he said this one was unusual , involving legislative leaders , the governor and top staff .	a 300-page report describes heavy lobbying behind aqueduct entertainment group 's selection last year to install and operate video slot machines at the track in queens .	fisch has referred the findings to the offices of a federal prosecutor and the manhattan district attorney .	both have declined to comment . "	in regards to the identity of the people whose activity we criticized , this is the highest , " fisch said .	the probe found lobbying for the multibillion-dollar contract brought more than $ 100,000 in campaign donations to legislative leaders and the governor , with $ 1.2 million spent by the bidders on lobbyists .	the largest share came from the winning but apparently unqualified bidder , aeg , which also got the benefit of leaked senate documents . "	it 's what everybody knew was happening but could never prove it , " said blair horner of the new york public interest group . "	and now you have it in black and white from an enforcement agency that this is how things operate .	... it will become grist for the reform mill . "	that bidding mess , done under a legislative exemption to normal rules that ban so-called procurement lobbying , led to new contract bidding by the state lottery division .	a malaysian-based gaming company ultimately won the contract to install and operate 4,525 slots at the track for 30 years , splitting revenues with the state .	fisch 's report could affect the nov. 2 elections since most officials named and criticized in the report were democrats .	but he also identified former senate republican leader joseph bruno as a chief intellectual author of the 2008 law that led to largely unrestricted bidding on what promises to be new york 's most lucrative contract .	a shift in power in the state senate would mean the current government controlled by new york city democrats would face a narrow senate majority led by long island and upstate republicans .	that could have far-reaching effects on the allocation of billions of dollars in aid .	it also could change the dynamics of a heated proposal to extract natural gas from an upstate shale deposit , something the economically depressed region has long supported , but new york city has fought because of a potential threat to its water supply .	fisch , a dapper , white-haired lawyer with a downstate accent , is a harvard law school graduate who began his public career in 1959 at the storied state investigation commission .	he could have retired a decade ago , but accepted paterson 's offer to become inspector general two years ago after rejecting an earlier offer to run an sic that had become a shell of its former corruption-busting self .	fisch plans to meet with the next governor after the nov. 2 election to discuss whether he should stay on .	the inspector general has authority to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch .	some political observers doubt that fisch will last long in the next administration , saying the next governor will probably want to handpick someone else .	following press reports early this year of a bent bidding process for the aqueduct contract marked by favoritism , fisch decided after an internal review that his legal reach could extend in this case to legislators .	two judges upheld that in lawsuits attempting to block his agency 's subpoenas for internal documents handed by senate democratic leader john sampson to aeg lobbyist carl andrews , a former senator .	fisch had recused himself personally from the case , having been appointed by paterson , a friend whom fisch once employed when he was a queens prosecutor , until the final draft was written .	instead , 14 people from his staff of 58 brought in and questioned all new york 's leaders and top lobbyists who had any hand in awarding or trying to influence the bid .	the staff concluded that sworn statements by several officials , in light of other information , were not credible . "	we pulled no punches .	no fear or favor .	we told it as it is , " fisch said . "	i 'm sure a lot of people are not happy .	my business is not to make people happy .	it 's my business to make the public happy that they 're being given the facts . "	after the thursday press conference where the report was released , staff investigators and lawyers gathered for a group picture to memorialize the moment .	while albany faced allegations of influence peddling , back room deals and power and money funneled to a few , the once fierce sic grew toothless , and its commissioners were allowed to leak information back about pending investigations to the governors and legislative leaders who had installed them .	it subsequently closed in a $ 4 million paterson budget cut . "	it boils down to people , " fisch said . "	and the sic went out of business because the people were not willing to do the type of job that they had the authority to do .

photos available in the staging area of the contentone photo website .	video with this story has been shared in brightcove .	@ by ben jones the ( appleton , wis. ) post-crescent madison , wis. - tens of thousands of protesters flooded the capitol square on saturday , vowing to take the fight over collective bargaining powers from the streets of madison to the voting districts of wisconsin .	two days ago , republican gov. scott walker put his signature to a measure that severely curtails the ability of public union employees to bargain collectively .	walker said the law is necessary to give financially strapped state , county and local governments the latitude to negotiate labor contracts .	his detractors say the governor 's plan sets labor laws in the state back decades and they have vowed to pursue recalls against republican officials who approved the changes . "	the war has begun , " declared a sign clutched by mark dickinson , a wastewater treatment plant operator from wisconsin rapids . "	we 're losing battles , but if you quit after the first battle , you lose the war , " dickinson said . "	we 're here for the long haul and i think you are going to see people here for a long time . "	protesters first converged on the capitol square on feb. 15 .	they occupied the capitol for more than two weeks and twice staged rallies that exceeded 70,000 people .	saturday 's rally numbered up to 100,000 people , madison police department spokesman joel despain said .	it drew high-profile public figures like actors tony shalhoub , a green bay native whose sister is a teacher , and susan sarandon , as well as the rev. jesse jackson , the longtime social justice activist .	it drew tens of thousands of public employees , and even farmers who created a " tractorcade " of farm equipment that circled the capitol in the morning .	and at its climax , it drew most of the state senate democrats who fled the state feb. 17 in an unsuccessful attempt to block walker 's bill .	from rally to recall @ now the test begins to see whether public opinion favors walker and his fellow republicans or public labor unions and their democratic supporters .	wisconsin law prevents recall drives against the governor and state senators until they 've served at least a year of their term , so any effort to go after walker , who took office in january , will not begin until next year . "	the future of our state is in the balance , " senate minority leader mark miller , a monona democrat , told the capitol square crowd . "	i do n't think anybody knew what they were getting in this last election and they 've asked for a do-over . "	already recall petitions have been launched against eight senate republicans .	those have been matched by recall efforts against eight senate democrats , meaning every senator eligible for recall is facing such an effort and raising the specter of a continuous campaign cycle in wisconsin for the next several years .	walker is confident he will win public support .	curbing unions ' collective bargaining rights will help balance budgets and improve efficiency in government , he said .	among the changes , most public union members will contribute more to pension plans and health care insurance coverage , and will lose the ability to collectively negotiate work rules or raises beyond the cost of inflation .	union-represented police and firefighters and the state patrol are exempted from the law . "	what we 're doing here , i think , is progressive .	it 's innovative , " walker told the associated press on friday . "	it 's reform that leads the country , and we 're showing there 's a better way by sharing in that sacrifice with all of us in government . "	amid the wave of fervent opposition to walker , jake jacobsen of waterford in walworth county was the only pro-walker supporter spotted by a gannett wisconsin media team of nine journalists covering the demonstration .	carrying a sign that read , " majority rules , " jacobsen said voters statewide elected walker to pursue such a strategy for balancing the state 's budget .	the protesters , he said , should express themselves on election day . "	this is not what democracy looks like , " jacobsen said . "	democracy happens in november . "	despite scoring one of the biggest legislative victories in wisconsin history , walker has made political enemies of most of the 175,000 public union employees who lost their collective bargaining rights , and even some who did n't from the ranks of union-represented police and firefighters . "	i think the people are finally wising up , " said john wilson , 78 , a retired union truck driver from janesville . "	i think people just got to thinking that the wages were coming their way and everything was going good .	but now people will understand that they will have to go to the polls to get what they need . " "	they will need to fight for their wages . "	for the demonstrators , who for weeks had endlessly chanted , " kill the bill , " saturday 's rally speakers were intent on igniting a movement that will continue after the protests end .	charles franklin , a political science professor at the university of wisconsin-madison , said saturday 's rally was planned before the state senate 's surprise wednesday vote on the public worker measures . "	so you transform ( the rally ) , you transform it into the kickoff for the electoral battles to come , " he said . "	this bill will be law for years and years until there 's a democratic assembly , senate and governor .	until then , republican control of one of those three things will prevent it from being repealed . "	recalling walker , and the republicans who control the legislature , was the message that demonstrators plastered everywhere saturday : on signs , on bumper stickers , on t-shirts , and on clipboards people used to collect signatures for that very goal . "	recall , recall , recall , " throngs of demonstrators chanted as they packed the streets curb-to-curb .	inside the capitol , retired state worker tom krajewski of madison managed a table with a statewide map so protesters could find their senate districts and immediately sign one of the eight recall petitions targeting gop senators .	krajewski said walker unleashed the recall efforts . "	this is something that scott walker does n't understand , " krajewski said . "	this anger is n't going to go away . "	can demonstrators sustain energy@? the collective bargaining law has spurred many public workers to become activists .	until a few weeks ago , hattie harbort , a dane county social worker in child protective services , would have spent a typical saturday visiting with her grandchildren .	but saturday , she walked through the crowd with a sign around her neck : " recall walker and his republican gang . " "	i 've been here a lot , " harbort said . "	we are his silent majority he 's been talking about .	he 's woken up a whole lot of people that he thinks is a silent majority just sitting at home waiting to vote for him .	he is wrong . "	jane ricchio of fond du lac , a secretary at the university of wisconsin-oshkosh , said she makes $ 15.30 an hour . "	this personally , just in an immediate way , is really hurtful because its going to cost me $ 200 to $ 300 a month , " ricchio said . "	i do n't mind paying my fair share but i was paying my fair share because these benefits were negotiated .	we took less money at the table , less salary , for benefits . "	this is going to hurt me .	i do n't have $ 300 a month . "	officers who worked the security detail at the capitol said the crowds continued to be respectful and peaceful .	janet aaberg , an employee of the wisconsin department of revenue called saturday 's rally part of a movement that 's growing across the country . "	we need to show them that the middle class counts , " she said . "	the farmers , the teachers , people are here to say , ' we 're tired , we 're sick of this , this had to change .

the first thing a visitor notices when she enters riegel 's pipe and tobacco on calhoun street is the sweet scent of pipe smoke .	it 's not overpowering - but pleasant and inviting .	three men are standing at the front of the shop . "	one of you has to be frank , " the visitor says .	the older man standing in front points to a man behind a register . "	that 's me , " says frank bougher , 48 , who was in grade school when he started working in the cigar shop that once belonged to his great-great-uncle .	riegel 's currently belongs to bougher 's father - the older gentleman in the shop - but bougher and partner john minnich are in the process of buying the store .	bougher 's hope is to be able to celebrate 150 years of being a family-owned business , a milestone riegel 's would hit in 11 years .	though bougher ( pronounced " boyer " ) started work in the shop when it belonged to his grandfather , he never thought he 'd get into the family business .	he went to school to become a catholic priest and then , an artist .	but it 's not easy to make a living as an artist . "	i tried to do other things , but it became my fallback plan , " he tells the journal gazette ( http://bit.ly/wbhwd2 ) . "	i went back to riegel for a paycheck .	yes , i love the business .	as a kid , i wanted to own the business .	now , that being a reality , it 's bittersweet .	i love working with my dad . "	once ownership of riegel 's transfers to bougher , he will be a fourth-generation owner . "	my grandfather 's uncle was al riegel .	he bought the existing business , " bougher says . "	it 's been in the family since 1904 , " making it one of the oldest family-owned tobacco stores in the country .	in addition to being the almost-owner , bougher writes advertising for riegel 's , runs its facebook page , updates the store 's website , helps buy merchandise , serves as clerk and cleans the restroom .	he also serves as a kind of makeshift historian .	he has written the histories at riegelscigars.com and keeps photo albums and bags of old images in the back room .	the images include riegel 's in its original location , across the street from its current downtown home , which has been at 624 s. calhoun st. since 1966 after it moved because of eminent domain .	there 's also his grandfather as a young man , standing in front of the store with a nameless supplier .	when bougher is n't found in one of his three tobacco stores - on calhoun street , in covington plaza and in georgetown square - he might be in his " studio , " which could be his basement or dining room table , working on his clay sculptures that will eventually be cast in bronze .	currently , he 's making a 6-foot tall statue of st. anthony on spec , which means the piece does n't have a buyer yet , though he 's hoping a local catholic school or church will bite .	st. anthony is holding a child in his left arm .	his right arm is on bougher 's workbench , but once it is attached , it will reach out , grasping a small ball of fire that will appear to hover over his hand .	more unfinished pieces are scattered throughout the basement .	there are small models , maybe 6 inches tall , that take 30 minutes to make .	they are what he shows potential buyers to gauge their interest .	there are busts , like the one he recently started of the rev. john m. d'arcy , the bishop emeritus of the fort wayne-south bend catholic diocese who died from cancer last month .	most of the bust was created by memory , bougher says .	d'arcy was installed as bishop during bougher 's first year as a seminarian . "	i was quite familiar with him , " he says .	bougher graduated from bishop dwenger high school in 1983 and started attending st. meinrad seminary and school of theology , where he received his bachelor 's degree in english literature with a minor in philosophy and theology .	eventually , he ended up at the university of saint francis , graduating in 1993 with his bachelor 's of fine art , with an emphasis in sculpture .	since bougher 's studio is also a basement , there are the signs of children and family among the artist 's work : a single drum , books and games , a punching bag still in the box , a small workout station and a box of spray paint .	then there 's a small white board with a sculptor 's to-do list : " faces , hem of robe , raise collar , arm , rock , left sleeve forward , tilt forward , ( big toes ) . "	what time is n't taken by riegel 's or sculpting is most likely spent playing chauffer .	he and his wife have five children , ranging in age from 7 to 15 years - one boy with four older sisters . "	there 's not much room for anything else , " he says , with ballet , soccer , cross country , choir , band . "	most time is spent driving the bus . "	bougher met his wife while he was an art student at saint francis , back when he was cycling 100 to 300 miles a week for six months of the year .	today , there 's simply no time to bicycle anymore .	bougher is one of seven siblings , and he 's the only one left in the family business .	he does n't expect any of his children to follow suit , given how much things have changed .	once , riegel 's was a destination shop .	people came for tobacco products , or they came to peruse the store 's newsstand or map selection .	today , riegel 's still sells maps and magazines , but it 's a much smaller portion of the business . "	at one time , this was the major newsstand in the city , " he says . "	the internet has made a big difference on magazine sales , newspaper sales , as well as maps . "	my grandfather used to like to carry maps in his truck and visit gas stations and set them up to be their supplier of maps . "	bougher , who was once an 8-year-old cashier at the store , says his children are n't even allowed to step foot in riegel 's during business hours , much less work the counter .	people ca n't enter the store unless they are 18 , which puts a major damper on the " slave labor " his ancestors got out of a teenage bougher and his siblings .	plus , downtown has changed , which has affected riegel 's , he says .	the city moved the bus stop , which changed the pattern and frequency of foot traffic that once passed by the downtown store .	and then , there 's the ever-growing negativity surrounding smoking .	once a common habit , smoking has gained a stigma , and it has become socially acceptable to scold smokers , bougher says . "	people come in here and tell us we should n't be smoking , " he says .	today , riegel 's is almost a seasonal business .	christmas barely makes a blip on sales because no one smokes cigars in cold weather anymore , bougher says , and the focus has shifted to include the lounges in the back of the three shops .	today , riegel 's lounges include wifi , large-screen televisions and satellite entertainment . "	it 's not a business anyone gets into to get rich , " he says . "	it 's something i do for love , ( for ) preserving heritage . "
ever heard of dog days brown porter , skull and crossbones extra pale ale or drunk monk dopplebock ?	if you 're scratching your head , then you 've never been inside the garage-turned-beer-laboratory of keith hawkins .	an employment specialist by day , the sioux cityan is a craft beer brewer by night . "	i 've always been interested in beer , " hawkins said . "	it 's been in the past couple of years that i 've started making it myself . "	it 's true that hawkins has turned his home garage into a beer lover 's dream factory .	behind every cabinet door are bags and containers filled with aromatic grains , yeasts and hops .	below them are pots and plastic containers used to ferment homemade hooch .	sitting along the side are antiseptically clean bottles that will soon become the final destination for hawkins ' assortment of carbonated concoctions . "	it 's fun , " hawkins said of his heady hobby . "	experimenting with different ingredients brings out the geek in you . "	resting inside of drawers are dog-eared copies of magazines offering at-home recipes for professional brewed beers . "	yeah , i take inspiration from some of these magazines , " hawkins admitted . "	but i also like to come up with recipes on my own . "	the basic ingredients for any beer are water , malt , hops and yeast .	a hopped wort ( pronounced " wert , " and meaning the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer ) contains sugar that will need to be fermented by the brewing yeast in order to produce alcohol .	from this process , hawkins can introduce additional ingredients to enhance or change the flavoring .	for instance , the more hops you use , the more bitter the beer .	a beer aficionado , he 's made his fair share of pale ales and ryes but prefers heartier stouts and porters . "	people think if a beer 's dark , it 's gon na be nasty-tasting , " hawkins said , shaking his head . "	but a well-made stout can also produce good head retention , has an excellent mouth feel and creates a nice finish . "	yet , it has taken a good amount of time for one of his beer creations to brew . "	the fermentation process can take up to an entire month , " hawkins said . "	and then , it needs to rest in bottles for another two weeks . "	so , it can take a month-and-a-half for his beer to go from the drawing board to one 's gullet ?	according to hawkins , it 's well worth the wait . "	i usually wait an entire two months because that 's when the flavor will be at its peak , " he maintains .	well , hawkins does have enough beers to help him through the waiting period .	in fact , he 's storing 30-35 cases of his self-created craft beers in his basement and quite a few commercially produced niche beers in his garage mini-fridge .	if this seems like a lot of on-hand beer , it is , especially for a man who does n't drink much . "	you would think i 'd be drinking beer all the time but i do n't , " hawkins admitted . "	when i do drink beer , i 'll take a few sips and then , throw it out . "	for hawkins , the joy comes in discovering all that can be done with a few deceptively simple ingredients . "	years ago , beer was beer , " he said . "	nowadays , people are adding all kinds of things to make their beers more flavorful . "	with oktoberfest around the corner , hawkins is hoping to incorporate pumpkins into a festive and seasonal home brew .	if that does n't work out , it 's back to his beer-making laboratory .	surrounded by colorful signs bearing such slogans as " beer , just supersize it ! "	and " save water , drink beer , " hawkins reflected for a moment . "	some people think this is a crazy hobby to have but i love beer , " he said with a shrug . "	when i 'm in the mood for it , there 's nothing better than beer , " hawkins continued . "	and when i get something that i like , i 'm always wondering if i can make it myself . "
jamaica 's culture minister says the government will refurbish the boyhood home of black nationalist leader marcus garvey and make it a heritage site .	lisa hanna says her ministry wants people to visit the home in northern st. ann parish and " pay tribute to a man who left a great legacy .

a controversial plan to open a hebrew-immersion charter school in bergen county might have its best chance at state approval this year as the christie aadministration looks to expand school choice throughout the state .	the application for shalom academy ?	thrice rejected by the state and opposed by local school administrators ?	is also buoyed by the opening this year of a similar school in east brunswick , which already has a waiting list for the next school year . "	if it 's a quality application , it 's got a better shot than ever now , " said derrell bradford , executive director of e3 , a statewide school-choice advocacy group . "	in the past , charters were viewed as a nuisance and granted grudgingly , " said bradford , who is helping the state review charter applications . "	without a doubt , the governor and the current department of education is more open and receptive to charter schools than any administration we 've had previously . "	in all , there are 50 applications in the latest bid for charters , a bumper crop for a movement that has been slow to grow since the state started granting charters in 1996 .	about 26,000 students attend 73 charters in the state , a small fraction of the 1.4 million public school students but the number is expected to grow substantially under governor christie , whose administration has made school choice a priority in its school reform efforts .	most charters are in cities with persistently failing schools , but there is a growing interest in the suburbs .	the shalom academy proposes to serve students in englewood and teaneck , two towns that each already hosts a charter .	the public school districts in both towns oppose shalom , saying it would drain too many resources from the local school budget and not appeal to a broad range of public school students . "	are you really going to attract the diversity that is teaneck when you have such a narrow focus ? "	said barbara pinsak , interim superintendent for the township .	charter schools are tax-supported and public , but are governed independently of local districts .	the money follows the student to a charter with the schools getting 60 to 90 percent of what each public school gets per pupil .	it is estimated that teaneck would need to peel off $ 1.4 million from its annual budget , and englewood slightly more for the operations of the new school , according to both districts .	critics say the charter is a " thinly veiled " attempt to provide a publicly funded alternative to jewish day schools , where tuition can be $ 15,000 annually .	both teaneck and englewood are home to a sizeable number of orthodox jewish families , most of whom send their children to the private schools .	in englewood , the moriah school , a private jewish school , serves 1,000 students in grades prekindergarten through eight .	indeed , some in the private school community have worried in the past that a public hebrew-immersion charter might also take students away from the day schools .	hebrew-immersion charter schools opened in brooklyn and florida in recent years .	the opening of the charter in hollywood , fla. , sparked debate over whether hebrew and jewish culture could be taught without teaching religion .	however , proponents say the schools are secular .	in september , the hatikvah international academy opened in east brunswick , and there is an application pending for a hebrew language charter high school in edison .	hatikvah now serves grades k-2 and already has more applications that than it has seats for next year 's k-3 enrollment , said principal naomi drewitz .	ninety-eight students are enrolled .	hatikvah overcame opposition similar to that now leveled at shalom . "	we 're always trying to dispel the misconception that we 're a jewish school , " said principal naomi drewitz . "	but it 's hard to convince people - we have a very , very diverse population . "	indeed , a mixed group was found on a recent visit to the school , now operating in a presbyterian cchurch right next to a district elementary school .	floretta caldwell said she chose hatikvah because of the low student-teacher ratio - there are about 17 students and two teachers in each class - and because she wanted her first-grade daughter dionna to learn a second language at a young age .	the mix of students is an added bonus , said caldwell , who is african-american and lives in east brunswick , where she says the schools are predominantly white .

nov. 15 , 2010 .	mandate mistake one of the few competitive advantages michigan has on health care costs is that it does n't have a lot of health insurance mandates ?	rules requiring that health insurance provide coverage or specific treatments for particular diseases or disorders that drive up coverage costs .	this is n't for want of trying .	there is talk of yet another attempt ?	this time in the lame duck legislative session , that would involve treatment for autism .	the michigan information and research service reports that there is an effort in the state senate to negotiate some sort of agreement on an autism mandate package that has already passed the house .	the house legislation would require that all health insurance policies cover treatment for autism .	the policies would have to offer coverage with dollar limits , co-pays and deductibles that are identical to coverage for physical illness , with the exception of a treatment called applied behavior analysis , which would be limited to $ 50,000 per year .	but there could be limits on how many times an insured person could visit an autism treatment provider .	obviously , this could be an extremely expensive mandate .	state sen. randy richardville , r-monroe , slated to become the next senate majority leader , held a series of public hearings on autism this summer that ended last month .	the michigan information and research service also reports that gop state rep. brian calley of portland , tapped to serve as lieutenant governor next year , is a supporter of the autism legislation .	the michigan information and research service reports he is the father of an autistic child .	intermediate school districts in this state are now charged with providing accommodations for pupils with special needs including autism .	a federal mental health parity bill adopted several years ago also requires treatment coverage for autism .	the obamacare health bill adopted by congress will also affect autism coverage .	so why would the state senate want to lock a coverage mandate ?	which involves specific treatments ?	into state law now ?	autism is a complex condition and medicine 's understanding of it is rapidly changing .	a state coverage mandate introduces unknowns into the state insurance market , which is itself in flux because of changing federal law .	the house version was opposed by most business groups .	but it was also opposed by the michigan afl-cio and the united auto workers on the grounds that they want to be able to bargain their health care coverage options .	it simply is n't good policy to adopt this legislation now and the senate should n't go forward with it .
the arizona congressman who called for convention and other visitor boycotts of arizona to protest its immigration enforcement law now says national groups should return their meetings to the state because a judge has put key parts of the law on hold . "	this is an important moment for the nation to pause and take a deep breath , " rep. raul grijalva , a democrat from tucson , said after judge susan bolton issued her ruling wednesday .	returning conventions and conferences to the state would " help us change the political and economic climate , " grijalva added .	within days of the law being signed by gov. jan brewer in april , grijalva called for a convention and meeting boycott of the state , saying it would help prod legislators to realize passage of the law was a mistake .	barry broome , president of the greater phoenix economic council , said wednesday that grijalva 's boycott call hurt arizona , particularly its hospitality industry workers , and that he 's not impressed by grijalva 's reversal . "	the position that he has now is the one he should have had in the first place .	i do n't think anyone from arizona , especially a congressman , should take a stand against arizona , " broome said .	fallout from calls to boycott arizona mainly have been felt in conventions and conferences , broome said . "	it 's easy for a professional association who is making a convention decision to take a pass on arizona because you do n't want to be caught in between on this issue , " he said .

simon cowell has gone from " american idol " judge to a potential headache for the show .	a furor over whether cowell 's british talent show " the x factor " electronically altered contestant voices has prompted " american idol " to make a pre-emptive strike . "	we have never , nor would we ever , use auto-tuning during the ' american idol ' competition , " producers of the fox show said in a statement thursday , referring to pitch-correcting technology .

six years after portland cited civil rights concerns and yanked its police officers out of a terrorism task force run by the fbi , the city council on thursday voted to resume cooperating with it .	the council voted 5-0 to approve a deal that both civil libertarians and the u.s. attorney agreed to , although with differing degrees of enthusiasm .	it marks a turn in a long , uneasy relationship between federal law enforcement officials and a city whose politics are heavily liberal , leftist and counter-cultural .	mayor sam adams said the agreement requires officers to obey oregon 's strict provisions protecting civil liberties , limits them to only those cases that involve crimes and gives the city 's police chief rather than the fbi authority to decide what cases city officers work on .	opponents of the deal said federal agents can open files and begin investigating on people exercising their first amendment rights , while oregon law forbids such investigations .	adams said he and police chief michael reese expect to get security clearances that will allow them to supervise the officers who work with the task force .	when the city withdrew , the mayor at the time , tom potter , said the fbi would n't give him the clearances he needed to supervise his officers .	the fbi says there 106 terrorism task forces operating in the u.s. , the bulk of them established after the attacks of 9/11 .	portland is the only major city to have withdrawn over a policy dispute .	it did so amid suspicions about federal investigations and dismay at the mistaken arrest of beaverton lawyer brandon mayfield in the 2004 madrid train bombing .	but the arrest of a somali-born oregon teen in an fbi sting in november changed minds on the council .	the teen was accused of plotting to set off a bomb at the city 's annual christmas tree lighting ceremony .	u.s. attorney dwight holton lobbied hard for the action and praised the council .	he said it means portland officers will begin attending daily briefings of the task force and said it includes " sensible and effective civil rights protections . "	he said it is " incredibly important " to have local officers who can " spot vulnerabilities here ?	and keep us focused on real threats , not distractions . "	the oregon chapter of the american civil liberties union supported the agreement , " with some level of concern and caution , " said andrea meyer , the group 's legislative director who helped negotiate it .	meyer said it requires annual reports on the activity of portland officers working with the task force , which could reveal requests for the city 's officers to participate in investigations oregon law wo n't allow . "	it 's not a question of if , but a question of when , " she told the council .	some members of the council said the council 's action comes with enough restrictions on officer activity that it does n't amount to rejoining the task force . "	it does not assign officers to the task force , " said council member randy leonard .	testimony at the council meeting was largely against the agreement , and came from a variety of ethnic and activist groups who said the fbi 's history makes it untrustworthy .	among those against it was mayfield , who got an apology and $ 2 million from the federal government after he was arrested , erroneously , on the basis of a fingerprint linked to the deaths of 191 people in the madrid bombing .	the fingerprint was n't his .	despite the terms the city put on officers working with the task force , he said , there 's still potential for officers to get involved early in cases when they should n't be , investigating legitimate political dissent . "	i 'm still concerned that this resolution goes far but does n't go far enough , " he said .	in another case that contributed to the tension between the justice department and the city , portland police refused a federal request for help in interviewing middle eastern immigrants as part of the investigation that followed the sept. 11 terror attacks .	the request was denied because oregon law says police ca n't question people unless they are suspected of being involved in a crime .
a utah judge says he will decide thursday whether to grant a request to vacate the death sentence of a man set to die by firing squad next month .	third district judge robin reese heard arguments in the case of ronnie lee gardner .	gardner 's defense attorneys want reese to order a new sentencing hearing in the 25-year-old murder case .	prosecutors say it 's too late for gardner to be raising any issues , such as whether a state court must consider the mitigating evidence presented during a federal appeal of the case before putting gardner to death .	reese last month signed the warrant that set gardner 's june 18 execution date .	the 49-year-old gardner was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to die in 1985 for the courthouse shooting death of attorney michael burdell that same year .
york county voters will decide next month whether county attorney bill sutter keeps his job .	the york news-times says ( http://bit.ly/s7shdw ) county commissioners during a special meeting on monday set the date for the election for dec. 20 .	sutter has been county attorney since april 2010 .	complaints from his staff prompted two county commissioners to file paperwork to recall sutter , who has rejected calls to resign .	last month , the county clerk verified enough petition signatures to force a recall election .	sutter has been accused of demonstrating inappropriate behavior and not adequately performing the duties of the office .	he denies the allegations .
many south dakota school districts have tapped their reserve funds , frozen salaries and trimmed spending to deal with this year 's cut in state financial aid , according to a survey done by the legislature 's budget panel .	sen. corey brown , r-gettysburg , said about two-thirds of the state 's 152 school districts responded to a survey he designed with the help of legislative staff .	lawmakers should be cautious in drawing conclusions from the survey because a third of the districts did n't respond and the information deals with only one year , brown said .	but the survey will give the legislature some help as it writes next year 's state budget , he said .	the survey generally indicates the school districts have been able to handle the cut in state aid approved as part of the legislature 's effort to erase this year 's budget deficit , brown said . "	by and large , i think most of the school districts , from some tough choices in many cases , appear to have avoided disaster , " brown told other members of the appropriations committee .	however , wade pogany , executive director of the associated school board of south dakota , said schools can only use reserves , freeze salaries and make other changes on a temporary basis .	in the long run , the state must again increase funding to schools on a stable , consistent basis , he said . "	it 's clear school boards have done what they were asked to do .	but it 's not an end solution .	it 's only a temporary fix , " pogany said .	gov. dennis daugaard early this year proposed a 10 percent cut in state aid to school districts as part of a plan to fix the state 's budget deficit .	the legislature found some extra money and made other changes to reduce the cut to only 6.6 percent .	brown said 80 percent of the districts responding to the survey indicated they will likely use reserve funds to make it through the year .	about three-quarters of the districts also will take money from a fund used for equipment or buildings and transfer it into their operating budgets , he said .	and nearly nine in 10 districts have given no raises to teachers or administrators .	however , brown said schools eliminated very few programs .	the survey also found that about 80 percent of the districts cut their operating budgets for this school year , and some laid off some staff or did not fill vacancies .	about a quarter of the districts reported that they reduced health insurance benefits for teachers , administrators and other employees .	sen. bruce rampelberg , r-rapid city , said many school boards are apparently tapping reserve funds with the hope the governor and the legislature will give them more money in future years .	the state is unlikely to increase taxes to boost aid to schools , so the schools should develop different approaches to best use the money that is available , he said .

the song , " anywhere with you , " epitomizes owen 's country music career : he strains for radio play by following formulas established by others , which keeps owen from establishing his own identity or point of view .	owen occasionally achieves a hit : the new album 's breezy title cut has become his third top 10 single .	but he misses more than he scores , and the reason can be found in songs like the clich ?	- filled " keepin ' it country " and the silly " apple pie moonshine , " in which a blue-collar guy hits it off with a wealthy young woman because her moonshine tastes so sweet .	as in the past , he focuses on lightweight fare that does n't resonate .	on better songs ?	such as the dramatic narrative " the one that got away " or the beach-party celebration , " nobody feelin ' no pain " ?	owen shows talent and personality .	but he has n't climbed to stardom as quickly as peers jason aldean and jamey johnson because , thus far , he 's failed to suggest he has anything distinctive to offer .

an oklahoma company said monday it will appeal a $ 4.3 million jury award to a utah man whose 2-year-old daughter died in a fire ignited when he poured gasoline from a plastic container into a wood stove in his mobile home .	blitz usa , which manufactured the container , told the associated press that evidence at the federal trial in salt lake city showed david calder recklessly poured or splashed gasoline onto live embers in the wood stove .	the " misuse of gasoline " caused the trailer fire , not any problem with the gas container , said james r. king , general counsel for miami , okla.-based blitz .	the company plans to ask a judge to overturn the verdict or order a new trial before filing for an appeal .	calder 's attorney , don winder , said the jury made the right decision on wednesday and that a 5-cent piece of wire mesh inside the gas spout would have blocked flames and kept the container from exploding .	the company insists its gas container did n't explode in the december 2005 fire and that calder had enough time to get his daughter out of the trailer .	in an interview , calder said his clothes immediately caught fire and he rolled in the dirt before trying to rescue his daughter .	he said flames from the wood stove followed vapors back inside the gas container . "	they do n't want to admit their gas cans blow up , " calder , a 38-year-old biomedical technician at the university of utah 's moran eye center , said monday . "	it 's basically a milk jug with a nozzle on it ?	really not something that should be in the marketplace .	yeah , i made a bad decision putting gas on a fire .	but i think it 's up to manufacturers to make things safer , and the jury agreed . "	the jury found blitz 70 percent at fault for the fire .	calder was held to be 30 percent responsible , reducing by that much his take from a verdict that topped $ 6.1 million for medical expenses , lost earnings and other damages .	calder was burned on 30 percent of his body and spent two months in the university of utah hospital 's burn unit .	a son also suffered some burn injuries .	his daughter , hailey parish , was engulfed by flames and died .	another son outside the trailer was n't hurt .	the blaze at the remote uintah county trailer occurred when calder was struggling to light a stove fire with wet wood .	his lawyer said calder was unaware the stove contained any burning embers when calder recalled pouring a " teeny bit " of gasoline on the wood , causing the gas can to explode . "	he was holding a bomb , " winder told the ap on monday .	he acknowledged calder 's gas container had a nipple ventilation valve that was broken off and could have been venting gas .	the company says that in a deposition , one of calder 's sons said he remained in the trailer for another three minutes , indicating there was no explosion or imminent danger .	winder said blitz 's own market research showed 20 percent of its customers use the cans to pour gasoline as a fire accelerant , yet it still has n't designed a safe container .	the company says nothing is wrong with its containers and that vapors from the gasoline calder spilled ignited a fire that started on the floor and gradually spread throughout the trailer .

swisher hygiene inc. said tuesday it will not file several financial disclosures before an extended deadline , and the company is filing appeals to prevent its shares from being delisted by the nasdaq .	swisher has until wednesday to file its 2011 annual report and first - and second-quarter financial reports .	the hygiene and sanitation products and services company said it informed the nasdaq on thursday that it would not be able to comply .	swisher shares are subject to delisting unless the company requests a hearing with the exchange 's listing qualifications panel , and the company said it will request that hearing .	the request will prevent the company 's stock from being taken off the nasdaq stock market for 15 days .	the listing qualifications panel will hold a hearing 30 to 45 days after swisher makes its the request , and panel will then take between one and six weeks to make a decision .	swisher 's 2011 report was due march 30 , and the panel could give it as much as 360 days from that date .	shares of swisher hygiene lost 39 cents , or 23 percent , to $ 1.34 in midday trading .	earlier shares hit a 52-week low of $ 1.32 .	in late march , swisher said its 2011 annual filing would be delayed because of a review by the company 's audit committee .	it said the review was mainly related to possible adjustments to accounting for business acquisitions and the calculation of its provision for money it is owed but did not expect to be paid .	the company said tuesday that its shares could also be delisted from the toronto stock exchange .
they both were walking alone , separated from their friends late at night , on or near the university of virginia campus .	one was found dead nearly five years ago .	the other is still missing .	now police say there 's a link between the 2009 slaying of morgan harrington and the sept. 13 disappearance of british-born hannah graham : forensic evidence found as a result of the arrest of jesse l. matthew jr. , who fled the state after being questioned by police in the graham case .	matthew , 32 , was arrested on a beach in texas , last week and brought back to virginia on a charge of abduction with intent to defile ?	or sexually molest ?	the 18-year-old university of virginia student .	if convicted , he could face up to life in prison .	his bond hearing is set for thursday .	virginia state police said monday that matthew 's arrest provided a new forensic link for investigators to pursue in the harrington investigation .	in a written statement , they called it a " significant break " released no details about the nature of the evidence , and said they would make no further comment .	the latest development may also help solve a 2005 sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in fairfax city , since the fbi previously said dna from harrington 's attacker matched that of the person who committed that sexual assault .	on monday , fairfax police spokeswoman natalie hinesley said that to maintain the integrity of their investigation , they wo n't comment on whether their case has been affected by the matthew arrest .	matthew has been accused of sexual assault before : when he was a defensive lineman on the liberty university football team from 2000 to 2002 , he was accused of raping a student on campus .	that charge was dropped when the person declined to move forward with prosecution , lynchburg commonwealth 's attorney michael doucette said friday .	before his arrest , police had searched his car and home , removing clothing and other items that they sent to the state crime lab for testing .	when he became a fugitive and was arrested in texas , authorities were able to gather more " forensic evidence " as well .	police have released no details about this evidence , nor divulged any results of lab tests .	matthew 's lawyer , james camblos , said he met with his client for about 2 ?	hours tuesday but still does n't know what police have on him in the graham case , let alone what evidence might link him to the death of 20-year-old morgan harrington , who vanished while attending a rock concert at the university of virginia in 2009 .	harrington 's mother , gil harrington , appealed to matthew on tuesday tell authorities what he knows .

u.s. prosecutors are objecting to a request by a venezuelan financier to be released from prison while he awaits sentencing in july in a fraud scheme , saying he 's a flight risk .	the financier , francisco illarramendi , needs access and substantial time to review documents to challenge the loss amount , said his attorney , stephan seeger .	he said conditions can be set to ensure his client 's return to court and denied that illarramendi , who is in prison in bridgeport , connecticut , is a flight risk .

two of florida 's u.s. senate hopefuls , gov. charlie crist and congressman kendrick meek , on sunday touted their plans to stimulate the lagging economy .	in an interview taped for cnn 's " state of the union , " crist said extending the $ 8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers would help boost home sales in florida .	crist left the republican party this year to run as an independent . "	i think any time you can reduce taxation in order to spur the economy forward , that 's a good thing to do and that would be great to do , " he said .	speaking live on the program sunday , south florida congressman kendrick meek said he would push for green initiatives and green jobs to stimulate economic growth in florida .	he also favored continuing tax cuts for small businesses and the middle class , partly paid for by rolling back bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy .	another way to pay for those tax cuts would be moving toward more diplomatic solutions in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , said meek , the democratic nominee in the contest .	he and crist will face republican marco rubio in november . "	getting our combat troops out of iraq is going to save this country money , " meek said .

"	i believe that i will win .	and what really matters is not somebody from alaska , but my fellow floridians , and that 's what i 'm focused on , " he said .	rubio gave the republican party 's weekly address .	he focused on the economy and government spending , and he said he favors extending tax cuts passed under president george w. bush that are set to expire in january .	he also favors repealing obama 's health care law and ending what remains of the stimulus legislation .

the financially troubled city of providence on tuesday issued layoff notices to all its nearly 2,000 teachers because city officials say they must make an unknown number of cuts in the budget , and they want " maximum flexibility . "	state law requires school departments to notify teachers by march 1 if they will be laid off the following school year .	the notices do not mean that the teachers will lose their jobs , just that they could at the end of the year .	school superintendent tom brady on tuesday wrote to teachers that the school budget outline for the next academic year is dire , with a projected deficit of nearly $ 40 million .	providence teachers union president steve smith told the providence journal the decision was " beyond insane " and creates chaos and anxiety among teachers .	providence 's financial problems have caused enough alarm at the state level that gov. lincoln chafee has instructed two of his top fiscal officers to meet with city officials .	a recent audit showed providence had nearly depleted its rainy-day fund and overspent its budget last year by more than $ 57 million .	this year 's budget gap is expected to be even larger .	mayor angel taveras last month created a municipal finances review panel to review the city budget across all departments .	it will offer recommendations to the mayor in the next two weeks .	taveras said in a statement that although he was sensitive to the uncertainty and anxiety that many teachers felt when they received the notice , " putting providence back on solid financial footing will require shared sacrifice across our community .

the terrorist attacks on the united states on sept. 11 , 2001 , inspired ken and mark unger .	the two local men were teenagers when the twin towers in new york city toppled , yet they both carried a silent remembrance and a call to duty from that day forward .	ken , 27 , who lives in richmond , enlisted in the u.s. army after high school and served for six years , including three tours in iraq .	mark , 25 , who lives in centerville , also enlisted in the army and similarly served six years .	his tours of duty included one in iraq and one in afghanistan .	they are america 's new faces of war , young men fired by patriotism , devoted to an unwritten and unspoken promise to serve . "	after that , i just felt like it was something i had to do , an obligation to serve my country , " ken unger said . "	my country was at war , " mark unger said . "	my grandpa ( william vedder ) was a marine and served in world war ii .	walking around his house and seeing the things that were important to him , it was obvious that it was something i needed to do they enlisted , both serving as military police .	ken served on posts all over iraq , trying to get various cities under control , starting a police academy in a city 60 miles southwest of bagdad and providing security protection for various individuals whom ken will never name .	his pledge as a military policeman prevents him from ever discussing specifics of his tours .	mark also trained iraqi and afghan police units and provided security for anonymous , apparently high-ranking individuals .	the experience , they said , was a mixed bag . "	it was a work in progress , " ken said of the effort to train iraqi police . "	we trained some pretty good people and some not so good . "	mark said it was a huge challenge for army mps . "	at times , it seemed hopeless , " he said . "	the language barrier and some of the people we were training , they had never had any kind of training before .	it took a while .	everything took a while .	normal things you think were easy were not . "	but they stayed true to their mission , their comrades and their units .	it is the point at which they shared a bond with military men and women who have served the nation for more than 230 years , and whose sacrifices are remembered nationwide each memorial day weekend . "	i did n't know what to expect , so you just kind of go with it , " ken said . "	you concentrate on doing your job , keeping yourself and your fellow soldiers safe . "	i was proud to do it , and i 'm glad everybody does n't have to do it , " mark said . "	it was n't what it looked like in the previews .	but i was happy to go and do my duty so that others , those with families , did n't have to go . "	ken is a 2002 graduate of temple christian school in connersville .	he served in the army from 2002 to 2008 .	mark is a 2005 centerville high school graduate who served in the army from 2005 to 2011 .	they are the sons of ed and mary beth unger of centerville .	while at war , the two brothers faced moments of extreme danger and intense fear , but they downplayed those experiences .

" "	we had good leaders who beat into our heads that you focus on doing your job , doing what you 're supposed to do .	when the adrenaline wears off , you realize what you just went through , " mark said . "	the big thing for me was that we had a lot of people back here praying for us . " "	we 're christians and if god said it was our time , it was our time .	fortunately , it was not our time . "	ken said memorial day is a special day for him and all veterans . "	it 's the day we recognize the sacrifices of those who did n't come back , " he said .

greg fisher is n't trying to save the planet with his two-seat , human-powered mechanical mountain goat .	it could help do that ?	or at least save it from some fossil-fuel exhaust ?	but fisher is a practical guy .	if his invention , the animas quadracycle , ever goes into production ?	and that 's a big " if " at this point ?	he figures most of the people who buy it will use it for basic road transportation .	the quad 's off-road capabilities will just be frosting on the cab .	to make enough animas quadracycles to kick in the economies of scale and lower the price ?	now about $ 15,000 a copy ?	he thinks it will take major mass production .	he believes a chinese manufacturer could bring the retail price down to about $ 2,000 with production of roughly 100,000 units .	and that kind of production would require demand from the masses ? "	africans selling gas in glass quart jars countries where there is n't a gas station on every corner , " as fisher puts it ?	rather than american thrill sporters looking to conquer some gnarly trails .	he estimates it would cost between $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 just for the parts to build a copy of his latest prototype , plus 300 to 400 hours of labor .	hence , the $ 15,000 current price .	but fisher understands that practical side of the quadracycle , using his latest prototype ?	which includes an electric assist ?	as urban transportation himself .	fisher said he uses the electric boost , activated by a thumb lever on the mountain bike-style handlebar , to get that extra push needed to make a light on east speedway or maintain speed on a hill .	in heavy , rugged off-road use , he kicks in the electric assist when he and his passenger 's legs and lungs are burning .	but those who would buy it strictly as efficient transportation would be missing some major thrills .	it 's as serious an off-road vehicle as any pumped-up 4wd jeep or baja buggy .	fisher proved that during a recent off-road , boulder-bashing ride on the chiva falls double-track trail off redington road on the east end of the santa catalinas .	fisher wo n't say " you ca n't tip it over , " but he does say he never has ?	despite his best efforts .	when you 're riding in the right seat ( the steering is on the left ) and he 's heading straight for yet another car-sized boulder that seems impossible to top , you 'd swear the first time may be mere seconds away .	fortunately , the driver and passenger are busy pumping the bicycle-style pedals , which keeps the lungs gasping for air too hard to spare any breath for screaming .	fisher 's invention has been getting some interest resulting from youtube videos in which he and the quadracycle seem to violate the laws of physics .	but nobody 's beating down fisher 's door to buy the rights and open a factory , and he says he 's ok with that .	he does n't see himself becoming the henry ford of human-powered vehicles .	he 's an auto mechanic by trade , and a philosophical mechanical engineer with a big green streak at heart and mind .
the state house says it 's ok , so mississippi drivers can text away .	house members killed a texting-while-driving ban wednesday night on a voice vote in the closing minutes of the 2014 legislature .	the house and senate had passed house bill 484 tuesday by wide margins , and gov. phil bryant had said he would sign it .	but rep. bill denny , r-jackson , made a procedural motion late wednesday that let house members vote on the bill again .	the measure would have banned drivers from writing , sending or reading text messages or reading or posting on social media using a mobile phone .	it set a fine of $ 25 per violation until july 1 , 2015 and $ 100 after that .	supporters of a proposed texting ban were furious that the bill had been rejected , saying lives would remain unnecessarily at risk on mississippi 's roadways as a result .	denny said that when he voted for the bill tuesday , he thought the ban covered only drivers under 18 and asked the house to reject the bill .	he also echoed the arguments of longtime mississippi opponents who say texting while driving is no worse than other forms of distracted driving , such as eating or adjusting the radio .	they 're loath for lawmakers to restrict individual freedom .	rep. ed blackmon , d-canton , also asked house members to reject the bill , saying a texting ban would lead to unjustified traffic stops by police officers . "	this will be used as another pretext , " blackmon , who has argued against racial profiling in the past , told the house wednesday .	proponents of the ban were indignant , saying the vote wrecked what was already a compromise in which fines would start low and tickets would count only as civil offenses . "	it 's just ridiculous that one person has killed a bill that was going to affect the lives of children and adults across the state , " rep. tom miles , d-forest , said wednesday sen. billy hudson , r-hattiesburg , said he 's been seeking a texting ban for five years .	he said he would try again next year , and said a ban needs to apply to adults as well as children . "	i 've been to funerals ; i 've been to hospitals , " hudson said thursday . "	i 've had family members injured and i 've had friends killed . "	mississippi is one of seven states where texting is n't banned for all drivers , according to the governors highway safety association .	the state does ban texting for certain drivers under 18 .	the insurance institute for highway safety estimates that drivers ' risk of crashing increases by four times when they are talking on a phone , and says the increase may be greater when a driver is texting .	the auto insurer-funded institute has found in two studies that although phone use goes down after telephoning or texting is banned , crashes do n't decline .	russ rader , spokesman for the institute , said thursday that researchers are n't sure why crashes did n't drop .	jonathan adkins , spokesman for the governors highway safety association , said that he believed bans would eventually prove effective . "	it sends a very clear message to drivers that texting while driving is n't acceptable , " adkins said thursday . "	common sense tells us anything we can do to reduce phone use behind the wheel is a good thing . "
massachusetts lawmakers ended their formal session for the year by passing measures to overhaul the state 's criminal records system and create a sales tax holiday .	lawmakers also gave final approval to a measure to reduce health care costs for small businesses , but failed to take a final vote on another measure to streamline the site selection process for wind energy turbines .	supporters of the wind energy bill hope the senate can give it a final vote during an informal session , delivering it to gov. patrick 's desk .	the session ended at midnight saturday .	sessions for the remainder of the year will be informal where a single lawmaker can halt debate .	patrick will now decide whether to sign the bills , veto them or send them back to the legislature with amendments .	under an agreement reached to overhaul the state 's criminal offender record information system , felony convictions would be sealed after 10 years , instead of the current 15-year stipulation .	misdemeanor convictions would be sealed after five years , instead of the current 10 .	employers would not have access to the sealed records .	in addition , employers could not ask job applicants about their criminal background on written applications but could pose the question during job interviews .

"	it sends all the right signals that we are serious about investment and growth here in the commonwealth , " said senate president therese murray .	legislators approved a compromise designed to help small businesses combat rising health care costs .	a tax on hospitals , which was included in the senate 's original legislation , was stripped out of the compromise bill .	the legislation allows small businesses to form cooperatives to strengthen their purchasing power and requires insurers to promote low-cost health care providers in their networks .	supporters estimate the bill would help small businesses save 10 percent on health care premium costs . "	it is going to be an immediate help to many small businesses who say they ca n't stay in business because of health care costs , " said sen. richard moore , d-uxbridge .	moore said the bill will set the stage for lawmakers to address other health care measures in the legislative session that begins in january . "	this indicates to payers and providers that we are serious about payment reform , " he said .	supporters say the wind energy bill would help the state meet renewable energy goals .	it calls on communities with wind power potential to create local boards to approve such projects .	the projects also would need approval from the state energy facilities siting board .	opponents argue the bill would take local control away from cities and towns .	but gov. patrick has said the bill is designed to reduce red tape , not local control .	bills forcing the state 's investment board to divest from any company with connections to iran and an overhaul of the state 's prescription monitoring system were also sent to patrick 's desk .

virgil hovden 's interest in winter perhaps goes a bit deeper than most .	he 's a fan of the famous iditarod trail sled dog race , and he and his wife , tracie , spent a month in alaska in 2004 .	they visited nome a year later to see the race 's conclusion . "	maybe the greatest sporting experience of my life .	i am still amazed at the bond and teamwork that each musher must have with their dogs ?	just unbelievable , " he said .	when conditions are right , hovden runs a dog team of his own across the rural buchanan county countryside .	but he is also a physical education teacher in the dunkerton school district , and a good portion of the school year plays out during iowa 's coldest months .	with a $ 1,000 grant from the mcelroy foundation and aea 267 , hovden found a way to combine his passion and his job .	hovden used the money to buy 20 pairs of snowshoes .	he had a couple of reasons .	first , snowshoeing , as the kids discovered , demands a physical investment from participants , beginning with getting the footwear in place . "	snowshoeing is a way to keep kids moving .	just getting the bindings on takes some effort , " hovden said .	figuring out the motion needed to walk strains other muscles . "	they 've got to spend time doing it , " hovden said .	according to snowshoe magazine , the gear can indeed be part of a workout .	stride for stride , snowshoeing in powder on level terrain typically burns at least 45 percent more calories than walking at the same pace .	the added bene?t comes from the weight on the feet , greater resistance in the snow and cold temperature , which requires a person 's metabolic rate to increase .	but it 's still considered a low-impact exercise , according to the magazine , putting less strain on joints .	beyond exercise , snowshoeing represented a unique topic for hovden 's pe classes . "	i have n't offered that before , " he said .	deep snow , the kind that make snowshoes helpful , has n't been a problem recently .	last week , cleats meant to grip ice were more useful .	but even so , joy keller 's fifth-grade class found a few lingering drifts along fences to test the technology .	makenna miller-verduyn , one of those students , enjoyed the brief outing .	but she does not anticipate buying snowshoes any time soon . "	they would n't stay on my feet , " she said .	she 's also not as big a fan of winter as hovden . "	i wish it was over , " miller-verduyn said .	as of monday all the students in fourth , fifth and sixth grades at dunkerton have tried what is likely a new experience for most . "	this week we 'll start over ?	if mother nature allows , " hovden said .
the magical world of harry potter is being meticulously reassembled at a former aerodrome near london .	the collection of sheds and sound stages is where the eight films were shot over the course of a decade , and soon they will be home to the official " making of harry potter " studio tour .	with more than five months to go until the tour 's march 31 opening ?	advance tickets go on sale thursday ?	stonemasons in hard hats are busy laying the ( real ) flagstone floor of the great hall at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .	even half-finished , its gothic arches , gargoyles and huge fireplace are an impressive sight .	when it 's completed , studio warner bros. hopes it will be , well , magic .	movies are all about illusion , but creators of this tour are keen to stress its authenticity .	the 150,000-square-foot ( 14,000-square-meter ) site will include only authentic sets , props and costumes , on the original studio site 20 miles ( 30 kilometers ) northwest of london .	for the movies ' cast , who spent a decade working here ?	the younger ones growing up on set ?	it can still evoke powerful feelings of nostalgia . "	i get shudders down my spine every time i walk back in there , " said tom felton , the 24-year-old actor who played harry 's muggle-hating hogwarts rival , draco malfoy . "	immediately , as soon as you go back it just fires up a decade 's worth of memories . "	i remember the first time i went in there ?	it was on camera .	( director ) chris columbus specifically did n't want us to see it before filming , because we were only 11-year-old kids .	so , our reaction when we walked in there was pretty much genuine . "	the vast great hall , where hundreds of hogwarts pupils dined , celebrated , and were divided into houses by the mysterious sorting hat , will be the centerpiece of the tour , but there will be plenty more to delight potter fans .	re-erected sets will include the cupboard under the stairs where harry was forced to sleep by his miserly relatives , the dursleys ; the imposing ministry of magic ; headmaster albus dumbledore 's book-lined office ; and hogwarts ' classrooms , common room and a dormitory , the tour is spread across two soundstages ?	stages j and k , a pleasing but accidental tribute to harry 's creator , j.k. rowling .	the existing stages here at leavesden studios are a through i .	as well as the sets , visitors will learn how the series ' magical creatures were created in the studios ' workshops , and see some of the 200 shipping containers full of props that producers have kept from the films .	the eight potter films made here between 2000 and 2010 were a mini-industry in themselves , employing both the cream of britain 's acting talent and hundreds of craftspeople and technicians .	part of the tour 's aim is to show off the behind-the-scenes skill that went into creating the spectacle .	the level of detail is impressive .	dumbledore 's bookshelves are lined with individually titled books .	his desk drawer opens to reveal quill-written letters and parchments that no moviegoer would ever have seen .	the weasley family kitchen will include a self-washing frying pan , enchanted knitting needles and other ingenious supernatural gadgets . "	the attention to detail and the care and the thought is breathtaking , and still is to us , even after eight films , " said actor mark williams who played arthur weasley , father of harry 's best friend ron . "	you 'd go on set and go , ' bloody hell , it works ! ' "	i think people will be amazed about what was created as a physical prop rather than fixed later in the computer , " added warwick davis , who played hogwarts charms master prof. filius flitwick and the goblin griphook . "	certainly for me , the filming experience on these was quite different to the work i 'd done on ' star wars , ' in the sense that stuff was here and real , " said davis , who appeared in both " return of the jedi " and " the phantom menace . " "	george lucas would 've built the first six feet of wall and left the rest to the computer . "	filming on the final potter movie , " harry potter and the deathly hallows : part 2 , " finished last year , and it was released in july , to a global wave of emotion from fans .	the studio tour is a way to keep the harry potter machine running ?	but to be a success , it must avoid feeling like a cynical cash-in . "	i hope people will come on the sets and feel the warmth on the sets , and the experiences that have been here , " said bonnie wright , who played ginny weasley in the films . "	they 're really lived in , all the sets .	they do n't feel just like a studio , they do feel like a world . "	it will also be a working movie studio .	the facility ?	for years a ramshackle collection of aging buildings and temporary structures on the site of a former aircraft factory ?	is being turned into warner bros ' british base .	the company says it will be the biggest studio complex in europe when it opens next year .	many people feared the end of the potter series would bring job losses in britain 's movie industry , but warner bros. ' investment ?	which will make it the only u.s. studio with a permanent base in britain ?	should bring a big boost . "	it 's lovely to see the redevelopment , " davis said . "	i just wish they 'd done it before we filmed them .	we spent years here in the damp and cold , and now i see these beautiful studios , with roofs . "	felton says he hopes to return one day to shoot a new film here . "	and if the work dries up , " he said , " we can always come back and be tour guides . "

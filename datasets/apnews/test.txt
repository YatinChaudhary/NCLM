a massachusetts sales tax applied to computer software design services may affect some new hampshire businesses with a presence in the state .	it took effect july 31 .	the 6.25 percent sales tax in massachusetts now applies to " certain services relating to computer system design and to modification , integration , enhancement , installation , or configuration of standardized or prewritten software .

indiana 's second-largest city is poised to end collective bargaining with all city employees except police officers and firefighters under a measure a union official said wednesday is being pushed by " far-right politicians " to the detriment of hundreds of hard-working public employees .	the fort wayne city council voted 6-3 along party lines tuesday night to approve the proposal sponsored by republican councilman john crawford , who said ending collective bargaining will save the city of nearly 260,000 residents large sums of money in the years ahead .	the vote was enough to override any veto by fort wayne mayor tom henry .	spokesman john perlich said the mayor does plan to veto but is hoping some council members will change their minds before they vote again in two weeks .	the measure would stop contract negotiations with six unions that represent non-public safety workers .	crawford said exactly how much the northeastern indiana city could save wo n't become clear until after the ordinance is approved and has been in place for some time .

"	we have birthday pay , we have perfect attendance pay ?	we have things that you will never , ever find in the private sector , " crawford said .	patterson said opponents of collective bargaining distort the truth to help push their agenda . "	it 's a new trend with far-right politicians .	it 's partisan politics at the expense of hard-working public employees , " he said .	the council is expected to take a second vote on june 10 .	perlich , the mayor 's spokesman , said the collective bargaining proposal is " disappointing " because fort wayne is in good financial health and is experiencing significant investments in its downtown and neighborhoods . "	we feel that we 've been pulled into this divisive issue that really is not necessary in our view , " perlich said . "	we want to make sure our employees are treated fairly and are treated well .

the amount of water held in reservoirs along the missouri river has started to decline slightly , but flooding is still expected to continue through the summer .	army corps of engineers reservoir manager jody farhat said friday was the sixth day in a row when more water was released from the six reservoirs along the river than came ?	something he called " good news . "	still , the corps does n't plan to significantly decrease the amount of water being released from dams because there 's still a massive amount of water in the reservoirs from melting snow and heavy spring rains . "	we 're still in a very active flood fight , " said col. robert ruch , who leads the corps ' omaha office .	any major rain in montana or the dakotas could force the corps to increase the amount of water being released , farhat said .	still , the latest observations from the reservoirs along the upper missouri river are encouraging .	the water level behind fort peck dam in montana is down about 2 feet from its peak , and it continues to decline about one-tenth of a foot each day , farhat said .	the lake behind garrison dam in north dakota is expected to remain level through the weekend before beginning to decline next week .	lake oahe remains about six-tenths of a foot below the spillway gates and is expected to begin declining in the next few days .	the reservoirs behind big bend and gavins point dams in south dakota are close to normal levels , but farhat said flood concerns are n't over yet and the amount of water being released from gavins point is expected to remain at a record 160,000 cubic feet per second for the immediate future .	that will continue to cause flooding downstream .	the corps predicts the missouri river will remain 5 to 7 feet above flood stage in much of nebraska and iowa and may rise as high as 10 feet above flood stage in missouri until at least mid-august .	the long-term nature of the flooding is putting tremendous pressure on the network of levees protecting homes , cities and farmland all along the river .	levees are more likely to develop problems when they are saturated .

pioneer pete 's wooden eyes are shining a little brighter .	the 14-foot wooden statue , which faces the front entrance to the arizona pioneers home in prescott , has a fresh coat of paint over his grand blue shirt , new black on his big shoes , and a little extra protection from arizona 's constantly changing weather .	pioneer home foundation board member beth mosier helped give pete his recent makeover .	mosier said the project began while she was walking through the pioneers home with one of the residents who expressed an interest in keeping the retirement home in pristine condition . "	she told me that there were several things that needed to done .	painting the pioneer pete statue was one of the things that needed to be done .	it was becoming very much in disrepair , " mosier said .	at that point she contacted local sign painter and pioneers home volunteer mike whalen to discuss the project and how best to paint the statue so it would last the longest . "	his feet were falling apart .	his hat had to be painted totally with glue , because the hat was falling apart .	he was painted with automobile paint , so he should last for a very long time .	we wanted him to look good for the residents here .	as a member of the board , what we try to do is help any way we can with resident activities .	we 've put in tvs , cushions , and now worked on pioneer pete , " mosier said .	whalen volunteered his time on the upgrade project . "	i volunteer here and there to give a little back to the community , " whalen said .	when it comes to the history of the large wooden statue , whalen said " there is no history . "	nobody knows who did it or when they did it .	they think he was done in 1930 or 1931 .	he 's cut from a stump of ponderosa pine .	someone cut him with a chainsaw and that guy wanted to remain anonymous .	to this day he is , " whalen said . "	he was named pioneer pete just because , " mosier said . "	he did n't have a name .	he does n't have an artist in back of him . "	the arizona pioneers home is a state-funded retirement home that offers continuous care to its residents .	the home first opened its doors in 1911 and can care for up to 150 people at any given time .	prescott icons sharlot hall , big nose kate , harvey house girls and other notable individuals have lived as residents there , mosier said .	the foundation board consists of all volunteer members , mosier pointed out . "	we 're always looking for new members to do activities .	twice a year we have a rummage sale and all the money from anything we do goes directly to the residents .	once a year we have a holiday bazaar where there are christmas items to buy .	that will be sometime in late november or early december , " mosier said .

a wilmington company recently won two major contracts with national retailers .	your only clue to its existence , however , may be its sign " coverbind " along i-40 as you enter or leave wilmington .	coverbind corp. has seen its revenues climb 20 percent this year ?	and predicts the same next year ?	and will have doubled its work force by the end of the first quarter of 2011 , said general manager john davis .	what coverbind sells ?	and manufactures ?	from its facility here is pretty much what the name implies : custom covers and the machines that do the binding . "	we produce any document , from a soft cover to a hardcover , " davis said . "	you drop ( the document ) in a machine right there , " a small device sitting atop a filing cabinet in his office . "	within seconds you have a hardbound book , a presentation . "	it takes the place of staples . "	but coverbind has no aversion to staples , the national office chain , where it has a contract to supply its thermal binding machines to all stores .	and you now can add another major office supply chain to the list coverbind supplies , though davis would not name the customer .	coverbind is the u.s. subsidiary of sweden 's bindomatic , but the operation is essentially autonomous .	in fact , bindomatic is looking to coverbind as a business guide , davis said .	an especially lucrative business is with the u.s. patent and trademark office .	coverbind designed the elaborate covers that enclose every patent issued .	coverbind 's staples and other office chain accounts have put the stores in the binding business as well , as they use not only the company 's binding machine but also its covers . "	the customer comes in and says , ' i am doing a presentation .	i need 50 of them done , ' " davis explained . "	within three minutes they are done , " davis added .	davis said his company has four or five competitors , but its biggest competition " is more of a lack of knowing this product is available . "	coverbind does n't have as many local customers as it would like , davis said , though ppd inc. is one of them .	but the real estate business is a big one here .	davis mentioned intracoastal realty and century 21 sweyer and associates as among agencies that seek to set their properties apart using professionally bound listing details .	nationally , sotheby 's is a client .	coverbind has no plans to produce its products anywhere but here and may expand its facilities in wilmington .	one reason coverbind won its latest retail contract was " the customer was impressed that we manufacture things in the u.s.a. , " davis said .	it enabled a lead time for delivery of four weeks for custom-made covers versus 10 to 12 weeks for the competitor , which had the covers manufactured overseas .	as coverbind expands , it seeks more engagement in the community .	it contributes to local charities and the arts and sponsors a soccer team .	exposure also means spreading its name .	coverbind will display its products at the wilmington convention center 's grand opening , davis said .	and the company would consider putting in machines at cost , so " people would actually know what we do . "

the state of michigan is clearing the way for about 130 prisoners to apply for parole after a judge threw out an unusual state policy that had treated them as mandatory lifers because they committed another crime behind bars .	the state wo n't appeal the 2013 decision as part of an agreement " to provide full , fair and complete parole review " to the inmates , according to an order signed last week by court of claims judge deborah servitto .	it 's a strange case .	the inmates were sent to prison on life sentences with a chance at parole for crimes such as second-degree murder , assault or armed robbery .	they typically would be eligible for parole consideration after 10 or 15 years .	but then they got in trouble again .	possessing contraband or a homemade weapon turned out to have drastic consequences .	some were accused of crimes while they were already out on parole .	in all the cases , inmates were placed in a new category that blocked any possibility of release .	the law 's interpretation by the corrections department and parole board was " mistaken , " ingham county judge joyce draganchuk said in september .	in a court filing , state lawyers said the law had been " consistently applied " and never questioned by the legislature .	the state 's interpretation apparently was discovered during litigation in another case . "	the issue appears to be resolved for all time , " paul reingold , a university of michigan law professor who filed the lawsuit with help from students , said friday .	he got testimony from shocked judges , prosecutors and defense lawyers who said they had no idea how the state was treating certain prisoners .	the inmates who should benefit include amy nowak , 43 .	she was arrested for shoplifting in st. clair county in 2010 while on parole from a life sentence and now is locked up and being treated as a mandatory lifer .	michael watkins , 51 , who has been in prison for more than 20 years , did n't learn about his no-parole status until his family filed a freedom of information request .
the national alliance defense fund says a town code that bars religious assemblies in private homes in the arizona community of gilbert is unconstitutional .	the oasis of truth church began meeting at pastor joe sutherland 's house in november and rotated homes several times a week for bible study and fellowship .	a gilbert code compliance officer hit the church with a violation notice after seeing a sign near a road advertising a sunday service .	a zoning administrator told the church that bible studies , church leadership meetings and fellowship activities are not permitted in private homes .	the alliance defense fund 's doug napier says no neighbors complained .	the scottsdale-based group has filed an appeal with the town of gilbert , contending its code violates the u.s. constitution .
democrat edward markey and republican gabriel gomez promised to highlight differences in both substance and style in the first of three debates between the u.s. senate candidates over the final weeks of a special election campaign that has yet to fully engage the massachusetts electorate .	markey , a 36-year veteran of the u.s. house , and gomez , a financial executive and former navy seal , were scheduled to square off wednesday evening in a debate sponsored by wbz-tv and the boston globe .	the candidates said they were looking forward to the debates that were shaping up as pivotal for both men but especially gomez , who has touted his political newcomer status but remains an unknown quantity to many massachusetts voters . "	i 'm a plain-spoken , direct kind of guy , " gomez said tuesday after touring polartec , a lawrence textile company . "	i 'm going to speak from the heart and i 'm going to convey the following message : this election is about the future , not the past .	it 's about having new ideas and fresh ideas as opposed to old and stale ideas , " he said .	despite his long tenure in congress , markey was little known before the senate campaign outside his house district in boston 's northern and western suburbs , and has tried to deflect criticism that he 's an out-of-touch washington insider . "	i think it 's important for us to talk about the big issues and to ensure that the voters out there know what the differences are between me and gabriel gomez , " markey said of the upcoming debate .	markey invoked democratic royalty during a campaign appearance monday with caroline kennedy , saying gomez does not represent " mainstream massachusetts values , " as the kennedy family did .	gomez , meanwhile , has lately tried to distance himself from the national republican party , saying he planned on being a " pain in the butt " to gop senate leaders .	but democrats moved quickly to undermine gomez 's claim of being a new style of republican .	a 30-second tv ad launched by the markey campaign on the eve of the first debate argues that on abortion , social security and guns , gomez echoes his party 's line .	for gomez , the perceived underdog , the challenge in the debate is to sound qualified enough to handle the job of senator , according to jeffrey berry , a tufts university political science professor . "	he needs to create an image of someone who is knowledgeable about the issues .	he 's had trouble getting beyond platitudes when asked direct questions , " berry said . "	he needs to project something more than just that he 's a good guy with a great biography .

hundreds of indian gay rights activists and their supporters celebrated the first anniversary friday of a landmark court ruling decriminalizing homosexuality and marking their gradual acceptance in the deeply conservative country .	members of mumbai 's gay community danced , sang , laughed and hugged each other in the city 's sprawling azad maidan park as speakers recalled the long years of struggle to get indian courts to change the country 's law .	on july 2 last year , the delhi high court struck down a law ?	section 377 of the indian penal code ?	that made sex between people of the same gender punishable by up to 10 years in prison .	while actual criminal prosecutions were rare , the law was frequently used to harass people . "	i 'm very excited .	it 's honestly independence day for us , " said arun mirchandani , 28 , who recently published his first book titled " you are not alone " which deals with being homosexual in india .	the rally was part of an event dubbed " 365 without 377 " that brought together gays , lesbians and civil rights activists in five cities across india , including new delhi , calcutta and bangalore .	vikram doctor , an organizer of the event , said the verdict has reduced incidents of police harassment .	other participants said the court 's ruling had brought the issue of homosexuality into the open and people were discussing it in public , a dramatic change in conservative india where even heterosexual sex is generally talked about in hushed tones . "	it does mean a lot .	people do n't avoid us these days , " said anshuman bludagoti , a student at the institute of hotel management .	before the verdict , bludagoti said if he and his male friends held hands on the train , people sitting next to them would leave .	but now " it 's a lot more open than last year , " he said .	despite the greater openness , bludagoti wore a mask at the rally .	he said he had not revealed his sexual orientation to his family .	rally participants said they still have a long way to go to ensure that the supreme court upholds last year 's verdict .	many religious leaders have opposed the high court 's verdict , arguing that gay sex should remain illegal .
the idaho supreme court dismissed attorney general lawrence wasden 's challenge of a new rental policy for hundreds of state-owned lake shore lots , in a decision filed wednesday .	a lawsuit wasden filed in march sought to block the state from using a new formula approved by the idaho land board to raise rents paid by owners of cabins and vacation homes built on the lots . "	the approved plan is flawed because the rent is too low , " wasden said at the time . "	the leases were written to favor the current renters at the expense of public schools and other endowment beneficiaries . "	the land board filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in april , arguing that wasden had failed to demonstrate the need for the idaho supreme court to grant his request for a writ of prohibition .	wasden claimed the policy approved by the land board sets rents at below-market value and in violation of the state constitution , which requires the land to be managed for maximum profit over time .	wasden is one of two board members who voted against the rent policy , which would raise rents paid in 2011 by 9 percent and by 54 percent over the next five years .	the idaho supreme court heard oral arguments in the case in june and nearly seven months later , has granted the motion to dismiss in a 3-2 opinion .	justices roger burdick and warren e. jones dissented .	the high court did not dispute wasden 's argument , and found that statements from three of the five land board members indicate that the cabin site leases do not achieve the level of market rent .	but the decision , authored by justice joel horton , found that the high court could not grant wasden 's request to stop implementation of the new formula when there were other speedy and adequate remedies for him to pursue in the lower courts .	chief justice daniel eismann and justice pro tem linda copple trout concurred .	the justices determined idaho 's district court system was in a much better position to decide the question at the heart of wasden 's case : is the idaho land board in violation of the state constitution ?	justice burdick wrote the dissenting opinion and said the land board had clearly exceeded its discretion and violated the state constitution " in leasing the cottage sites for less than market value and failing to obtain the maximum long-term financial return for the beneficiaries . "	there is no other plain , speedy and adequate remedy available for wasden to pursue , burdick said .
minnesota house republicans said monday they 'd push for property tax relief for home and business owners in the next legislative session , amid continuing fallout from the elimination of a popular property tax credit earlier this year .	rep. greg davids , r-preston , said at a capitol news conference that he 'd push to dedicate about $ 80 million to lowering property taxes .	davids said that comes in response to frequent complaints he heard in recent months about the loss of the homestead market value credit , which benefited about 95 percent of the state 's homeowners ?	most to the tune of at least several hundred dollars a year .	gov. mark dayton and republican lawmakers eliminated the credit as part of their agreement to close a $ 5 billion budget shortfall .	the move to save the state about $ 600 million was little noticed at the time but erupted afterward into a dispute between the democratic governor and republicans over who had suggested it .	dayton has said he went along with the proposal only to end a state government shutdown but did n't agree with the idea .	davids , the chairman of the house taxes committee , said monday that he did n't foresee bringing back the credit , particularly with another budget shortfall on the horizon he expects will exceed $ 500 million .	but davids said carving out some state money to send back to commercial and residential property taxpayers would benefit an ailing state economy that can be blamed in large measure for the perpetual shortfalls . "	i happen to believe that what gets us out of our economic woes is private sector job growth , " davids said .	he said republicans would set aside the needed $ 80 million with cuts to other state programs .	bloomington state rep. ann lenczewski , the senior democrat on the taxes committee , said davids ' proposal would do little to undo the sting of losing the homestead credit for most property owners . "	frankly , it looks to me like they want to put themselves behind the idea of property tax relief to distract from taking away the homestead credit , " said lenczewski , who plans to introduce legislation next session to restore the credit . "	but it sounds like a pretty pale replacement for what we lost . "	many local government officials also bemoaned the loss of the credit .	alan oberloh , the mayor of worthington and president of the coalition of greater minnesota cities , said the group appreciated davids ' efforts but that it would be cold comfort . "	the legislature cut over $ 600 million in property tax relief in the summer and today offered to fix it with $ 80 million , " oberloh said .	davids ' proposal seeks to cut the statewide property tax burden by 18 percent for commercial and industrial property owners in greater minnesota , and by 4 percent in the twin cities area .	for homeowners , it would target relief to those who see their local property taxes rise by 12 percent or more in 2012 .	those homeowners would see an increase in the percentage of property taxes that the state refunds from the current 60 percent to 90 percent , and would increase the maximum refund available to already eligible homeowners by 20 percent .	davids ' proposal sets the table for what 's certain to be another contentious debate between dayton and lawmakers over tax reform and spending cuts when the legislature reconvenes in st. paul in late january .	dayton has called many times for income-tax increases on upper-income minnesotans to address perpetual state budget shortfalls , but davids again monday said that idea would garner no republican support at all .	davids said it was too early to say what spending republicans would seek to cut to pay for property tax relief , but said " everything is on the table " ?	except dayton 's desire for income tax increases .
the figures obtained by the aclu following a lawsuit raise questions about the efficacy of the checkpoints and come amid growing opposition to them .	critics say the checkpoints result in racial profiling and abuse of power by agents .	the border patrol says they are crucial to catching human and drug smugglers who cross illegally into the united states .	but very few arrests are made at checkpoints .	for example , only 697 of the 120,939 immigrant apprehensions made by the border patrol in the tucson sector in fiscal year 2013 were made at checkpoints .	that 's 0.57 percent .	the checkpoints can be within 100 air miles of the country 's border and are usually located on highways and small roads .	people who drive through a checkpoint are asked to reveal whether they are u.s. citizens .	james lyall , an aclu attorney who focuses on the arizona border with mexico , said the data show why the border patrol has been less than forthcoming with arrest and seizure statistics from checkpoints . "	if policy makers and the public are able to get complete and accurate information from the agency , it may be a lot harder for the border patrol to justify these operations with the usual blanket claims that they 're efficient and effective , " lyall said .	tucson sector chief manny padilla has defended the checkpoints .	at a protest in may , he said the checkpoints are a crucial component of the agency 's strategy and that they are strategically located in routes that smugglers take .	the agency said in a statement thursday that it ca n't comment on ongoing litigation .	lyall is helping represent two residents of a small arizona town called arivaca who say the checkpoints are marred with racial profiling and constitutional violations .	the residents and others from the area have spent the past year monitoring agents at a checkpoint in amado , arizona , jotting down details they observe , such as the model of cars and the apparent ethnicity of drivers pulled over for secondary inspection .	a federal magistrate judge recently denied the aclu 's request for a temporary injunction that would have allowed the monitors to get closer to the agents .	the lawsuit is ongoing .

ireland 's debt crisis eased a notch friday after european governments reassured investors that new , tougher terms for bailouts will not expose them to higher costs on their current holdings of irish bonds .	in a short statement meant to calm market fears and keep investors from selling off irish bonds , the finance ministers of germany , france , italy , spain and britain said the eu 's proposed new bailout mechanism " does not apply to any outstanding debt . "	that means current lenders to governments would not be liable for extra costs in case of a bailout .	germany has been pushing to share the burden with investors , but has not explicitly said it would seek to impose those changes on investors ' current holdings .	pressed by market jitters that threatened to turn ireland into the next greece , eu ministers agreed friday to be clearer about their intentions and confirmed the new rules would not come into force before mid-2013 .	germany 's push to make investors take a " haircut " or only partial repayment in case of a bailout led to a bond selloff , as investors feared additional losses in case it comes to a rescue .	that had the effect of cranking up yields on irish bonds ?	and potentially the increase borrowing costs the already-strapped country would have to pay when it goes back into the bond market for new borrowing .	the statement took the edge off tensions in bond markets , pushing the irish 10-year bond yields to 8.25 percent from 8.87 percent on the open and thursday 's record high of 8.95 percent .	traders remained on edge , however , as a concrete decision on the new bailout mechanism and its implications for private investors will not be made before the middle of december at the earliest , when eu leaders meet .	eu finance ministers will gather and discuss the issue next week but the european commission , which is tasked with creating new rules as part of a permanent mechanism to deal with sovereign bankruptcies , will not have anything concrete to offer yet .	after saving greece from bankruptcy in may , the eu set up the european financial stability facility , a euro750 billion ( $ 1.03 trillion ) backstop for any other countries that might need support .	but that was meant only as a temporary cash guarantee until the eu agreed firm guidelines on how to deal with sovereign default .	significantly , anger grew among citizens in less profligate countries ?	particularly germany , the region 's paymaster ?	over having to pay for other countries ' overspending .	the fact that investors , whose job it is to risk money in order to make financial gains , were guaranteed against losses caused an uproar that politicians are still trying to calm .	analysts at glas securities in dublin say that lack of full understanding by investors of the bailout mechanism " has in itself added considerably to the ' fear of the unknown ' and consequent rise in irish yields . "	other heavily indebted countries like portugal and spain have likewise seen their borrowing costs jump as investors reassessed the risk involved in holding their debt in light of the potential changes to the bailout rules . "	market participants will still probably have to accept that the issue will drag on for some time but have this morning received a reassurance that the final outcome is unlikely to be as penal as initially feared , " the analysts said in a note to investors .	ireland has enough cash to last through the middle of next year , meaning it is unlikely to require a bailout like greece 's soon .	however , the sheer size of the country 's banking crisis ?	its bailout is the world 's largest when measured per capita ?	suggests the government will take a very long time to regain market trust in its finances .	that is not helped by the dire outlook for the economy , which the government is pounding with savage austerity cuts to lower its budget deficit .	the government 's focus is on honoring global investors ' claims on otherwise bad loans , saddling public finances and taxpayers with the losses in an effort to retain investors ' trust .	meanwhile , unemployment is high and the property market , which helped inflate the celtic tiger 's growth bubble , remains in the doldrums and is still claiming victims ?	irish media reported friday that michael mcnamara & co. , one of the country 's biggest construction firms , was put into receivership under the weight of some euro1 .5 billion in loans it could not service .	ireland 's government has an ambitious plan to slash euro6 billion ( $ 8.5 billion ) from its 2011 deficit in a budget that will go to lawmakers in december .	beyond that , the government hopes to prune euro9 billion more in coming years to get ireland 's deficit ?	currently running at a modern european record of 32 percent of gdp ?	back to the euro zone 's limit of 3 percent by 2014 .	brian lenihan , ireland 's finance minister , welcomed the clarity and solidarity provided by his eu counterparts .	he said in a statement that the " eu partners have confirmed their full confidence in the budgetary strategy being pursued by the government . "

"	i stayed in the army , " said marshall , who lives in nashville and is the commander for the vietnam war veterans group in brown county . "	i did not mix with the american public , but i would hear stories and i saw it on tv .

"	before they left for the war , they believed in god , believed in unity and believed in the excellence of america . "	this was all falling apart , " marshall said . "	our way of life was disintegrated . "	marshall said the government treated veterans poorly , and others felt college students were the worst . "	we were called upon by our country , and we went ... because of who we are , " conley said . "	others went to canada .	others sat on the stairs of our courthouse and called us baby killers . "	when they returned from vietnam , it was n't that different .	conley said people threw things at them , and they were still called names . "	we were not given a hero 's welcome , " conley said . "	it was hard to believe . "	the hero 's welcome came much later . "	after desert storm , when the veterans returned from desert storm , someone woke up and said ' hey , we never thanked our veterans , ' " marshall said . "	i first thought ' cute .	too little , too late . '	but then i realized they meant it . "	it is wonderful to be recognized now , when we really need it .	many of us ca n't hear , some of us are missing limbs , most of us have walking canes .	we need this right now , and we 're getting it .	we feel very good about it . "	it 's wonderful when people see my hat and say ' thank you for your service . '	we did n't hear that for 30 years .	i 'm 70 ; we either get it now or we 're never going to hear it . "	conley stressed that all vietnam war veterans should now look to the future instead of holding onto the past . "	we need to forgive , " conley said . "	yes , let 's forgive the government , the legislators , the uninformed college students who called us names .	i live today with love .	i 'm telling you , the hate 's gone .	after 42 years of leading combat , i 'm home .

south carolina voters were choosing republican nominees in four congressional races tuesday , including a hotly contested open seat along the coast that pits a black republican against the son of the late sen. strom thurmond .	tim scott , the first black gop south carolina state lawmaker in more than a century , placed first in his nine-way primary but did not gain a majority vote to avoid the 1st district runoff against attorney paul thurmond .	both men have discounted the historical implications of their bids to replace retiring rep. henry brown , preferring instead to focus on criticism of federal spending .	the winner faces democrat ben frasier in november , but the district has been in gop hands for three decades so there is the potential scott could become the first black republican in congress since oklahoma 's j.c. watts retired in 2003 .	some national republicans , including former alaska gov. sarah palin , have endorsed him .	scott 's dozen years on charleston county council and his term in the state house were enough to get robert shuler 's vote . "	he had a record and thurmond did n't have anything .	you 've got ta have a track record .	you 've got to have a background ?	we 've got a president of the united states right now who is only fit to be a dog catcher , " said shuler , a 61-year-old retired defense department engineer from mount pleasant .	elsewhere , six-term gop rep. bob inglis was looking to save his job after placing second in his primary to popular prosecutor trey gowdy .	inglis , long respected in the ultra-conservative 4th district that includes greenville and spartanburg , has fallen on tough times thanks to moves that riled his constituents and an anti-incumbent sentiment sweeping the nation .	in a five-way primary , inglis won 27 percent of the vote after challengers focused ire over his support for the 2008 financial bailout and his suggestion voters turn off the tv when glenn beck appeared .	gowdy , chief prosecutor for spartanburg and cherokee counties , won 39 percent and said if experience were the only thing that mattered , no challenger would ever win .	he said voters unhappy with the country 's direction are willing to consider someone new . "	if people want to change washington , we ca n't do that by sending the same folks back up there , " gowdy said .	gowdy 's call to shake up congress connected with everett fuller of greenville . "	like so many other americans , i think there needs to be a change in washington , " said fuller , a 56-year-old physician . "	we 're sick of the way this country is being run . "	but inglis still had support from some conservatives , like paul aiesi , a 34-year-old commercial real estate investment manager from greenville . "	nobody can argue with his conservative credentials , " aiesi said . "	i think he got a bad rap on the tarp vote .	it was probably the right vote even though it was not politically popular . "	the winner will face democrat paul corden of spartanburg in november .	along the state 's western line , a political unknown who owns a fleet of ice cream trucks faces a state lawmaker for the republican nomination to replace u.s. rep. gresham barrett .	businessman richard cash , of powdersville , and state rep. jeff duncan , of laurens , were competing for a chance at the seat left open by barrett 's run for governor .	the winner will face fedex pilot and former air force capt. jane dyer of easley in november .	scott and duncan , a four-term lawmaker , are among only 12 candidates nationwide endorsed by washington-based club for growth , which promotes reducing taxes , budget reform and free trade .	on tuesday , the group said donations from its members and political action committee totaled more than $ 313,000 for scott and nearly $ 400,000 for duncan .	cash , who held a lead of less than 2,000 votes in the primary , has alleged the outside influence is trying to buy the race , which duncan denies .	in a race where little separated candidates ' platforms , the men have sought to outflank each other on the right .	cash , a father of eight who formerly worked full-time for an anti-abortion group , says he wants to be a leader in opposing abortion .	in the state 's majority black 6th district , two republicans were vying for the chance to challenge powerful u.s. house majority whip jim clyburn .	nancy harrelson , who was trounced by clyburn in 2008 , was in a runoff with political newcomer james pratt .
a las vegas businessman has entered the u.s. senate democratic primary against congresswoman shelley berkley .	the las vegas review-journal reported ( http://bit.ly/wx2f8u ) thursday that barry ellsworth is the founder of green plains renewable energy , the fourth-largest ethanol firm in the world .	ellsworth sold his interest a few years ago , and he now invests through his las vegas firm , sae capital partners .	he says that he can do a better job than berkley and her republican rival , u.s. sen. dean heller .

a bill which would have authorized construction of a $ 3.5 billion clean coal technology plant in taylorville has failed in a vote in the illinois senate .	after the bill failed wednesday to get the 30 votes needed for passage its senate sponsor , carlinville democrat deanna demuzio , used a parliamentary maneuver to keep it alive for another possible vote .	it will die if it has n't been passed by the senate by the time a new general assembly is sworn in next wednesday .	the legislation would authorize construction of the taylorville energy center by omaha-based tenaska energy .	the ( springfield ) state journal-register reports it is opposed by a group of industrial opponents led by chicago-based exelon .	demuzio and other supporters say the plant would create thousands of jobs , both during construction and operation .
paterson 's remarks came during a low-key address in buffalo that recapped highlights of his state of the state address in albany last week .	the federal government is offering between $ 500 million and $ 700 million to a small number of states who comply with certain goals laid out by president obama through its " race to the top " program .	the goals are n't popular with everyone , and the state legislature has n't yet passed paterson 's legislation , though the federal application deadline is tuesday .	lawmakers were discussing the bill , but no decision on whether to support the plan has been made . "	it comes down to the character of government ?	whether or not we come to the table , " paterson said , adding that on " planet albany " lawmakers are slow to act .	paterson announced legislation last week that would eliminate the charter-school cap , allow swifter state takeovers of low-performing schools and other measures to help boost new york 's chances of getting the federal aid .	he wrote a letter to legislators tuesday imploring them to pass the bill .	lawmakers are n't expected back in albany until next tuesday -- the same day paterson will release his 2010-11 budget proposal .	paterson gave a preview of some budget initiatives tuesday , saying he will seek consolidations of some state agencies and root out wasteful spending .	his office is also seeking to streamline some state functions , such as consolidating state call centers .	the plan would lead to the reduction of 80 jobs , mainly through attrition , aides said .	business groups applauded the proposals . "	lowering the cost of government and the taxes required to pay for it is fundamental to allowing the new york economy to grow again so it can create the jobs we desperately need across the state , " said kenneth adams , president of the state business council .	in buffalo , he again spoke of a program that would rehabilitate vacant housing in buffalo , rochester , syracuse , utica and binghamton .	the program will start in buffalo and then be expanded to other cities .	paterson also emphasized his plans for ethics reform , saying it is tied to the state 's economic future .	paterson has proposed term limits , lower campaign-contribution limits and a new board to oversee lawmakers . "	there is a relationship between the ethics of government and the function of government , " paterson said .	includes reporting by gannett albany bureau staff writer joseph spector and democrat and chronicle staff writer nestor ramos .

abc 's search for someone to preside over its news division comes as the internet and cable television have made the job much different and more complex than what outgoing chief david westin took over nearly 14 years ago .	abc news employees returned from a holiday weekend to learn that westin would step down at the end of the year .	abc 's parent company , the walt disney co. , needs to find an executive who treasures traditional news values yet can transform a division at a time people have many different ways to find news beyond broadcast television .	making money would n't hurt , either .	westin inherited the job from tv legend roone arledge , who built a stable of stars at abc news .	lately , the network has been forced by the business climate into retrenchment .	abc news has cut a quarter of its staff over the past few years .	there was a time when being an abc , cbs or nbc news president was almost like being a supreme court justice : their job was to uphold news standards and perform a public service , said andrew heyward , cbs news president for 10 years ending in 2005 .	profitability was n't a big issue . "	they enjoyed a comfortable oligopoly , " heyward said . "	they competed against one another , but they certainly did n't compete against the hundreds and hundreds of companies that have news operations now .	you had a simpler competitive environment and a simpler mandate . "	the web had n't matured as a news source when westin started his job .	fox news channel and msnbc had just arrived , but were n't closed to figuring out a way to compete effectively with cnn , as they have now with programs that appeal to partisan audiences .	in the past decade though , online news has exploded and cable tv has grown to take a dominant position in the living room .	disney 's cable tv properties are growing and are providing healthy profit margins while abc has stalled .	the network had revenue of about $ 3.3 billion last year , with only $ 7 million left after costs , according to data from snl kagan .	by contrast , disney 's espn channel brought in $ 6.3 billion in revenue , or about $ 1.5 billion after costs .	between cable and digital competition , and a collapse of the advertising market , westin faced " a cascading series of difficulties coming down on everyone in the news business , " said richard wald , a columbia university president and former abc executive .	although abc has stayed a solid second behind nbc in the ratings for most newscasts , nbc has a huge financial advantage in being able to spread costs around to sister cable channel msnbc .	neither abc nor cbs has a comparable news channel on cable .	at 58 , and with continued financial pressures and retrenchment in the future , westin saw a good time to leave .	he was not available to comment on wednesday , a spokesman said .	he 's planning to stay on until the end of the year to help with the transition .	his immediate bosses at abc and at disney , anne sweeney and bob iger , would be responsible for selecting a successor .	there would be no shortage of candidates from a traditional pipeline for news division presidents : jon banner has been the longtime executive producer of " world news " ; jim murphy , " good morning america " executive producer , also led cbs ' evening newscast ; and paul slavin has run abc news ' digital operation .	disney has sometimes tapped executives from other divisions within the same company .	abc family president paul lee replaced steve mcpherson as entertainment chief for the abc broadcast network , for example .	given the challenges of having to transform the division and the multiple skills needed , heyward predicted that disney would not select someone currently at abc news . "	these ( news ) organizations were built to fight a different war ?	arguably yesterday 's war ?	where gathering news , taping it , editing it and transmitting it were difficult , " heyward said . "	now these things are easy .	so the infrastructure has to change .	the product has to change . "

george clooney 's world war ii drama " the monuments men " is being pushed to 2014 and out of the fall awards season .	the movie will now be released in the first quarter of next year , instead of its planned release date of dec. 18 , a spokesman for sony pictures said wednesday . "	monuments men , " which clooney directed , co-wrote and stars in , had been expected to be among the top oscar contenders .	the film could still compete for awards next year , but the early-in-the-year positioning suggests sony does n't expect it to .	movies released early in the year ?	much less sought-after territory than the lucrative holiday movie-going season ?	rarely garner any awards interest .	sony said the film is being delayed so clooney can finish the film 's extensive visual effects . "	the monuments men , " which also stars matt damon and bill murray , is about a world war ii platoon whose mission is to rescue artworks from the nazis .	based on a true story , the film is adapted from robert edsel 's book " the monuments men : allie heroes , nazi thieves and the greatest treasure hunt in history . "	reportedly made for $ 65 million , clooney has conceived of " the monuments men " as a popular period drama tinged with comedy in the mold of " the great escape . "	while an early 2014 release takes the film out of the awards hunt , it could find more room at a less crowded box office . "	the monuments men " is only the latest film to shift out of the fall movie-going season .	previously pushed into 2014 were " foxcatcher , " '' grace of monaco " and " the immigrant . "	the los angeles times first reported the release date change .
an investigation at attorney general mike dewine 's office last year determined dewine 's then-employment law chief failed to properly report an employee who repeatedly told a legal secretary he liked to slap and punch women .	records obtained by the associated press show supervisor timothy lecklider was given the unusual opportunity of having a compliance officer 's finding against him re-investigated .	new witness interviews led to the finding against lecklider being overturned .	dewine 's spokesman says lecklider had a right to due process and the office followed all policies .	it 's the second internal harassment case to surface as dewine seeks re-election that parted from normal protocol .	also last year , dewine requested and received the name of a confidential informant thought to have knowledge of an alleged sexual harasser .	the case was closed days later .
a prison break that saw convicts with records of deadly violence run loose before being recaptured has emerged as a political issue for gov. jan brewer and arizona legislators .	two of the escaped convicts had murder convictions and the third had one for attempted murder , and authorities have linked two of the escapees and the alleged accomplice to the killings of an oklahoma couple whose burned bodies were found in new mexico .	the last inmate still at large was recaptured late thursday , along with an alleged accomplice .	a scathing report released hours earlier by brewer 's own administration said the privately operated state prison where the july 30 occurred had major security flaws , including some that contributed to the breakout , that went undetected by the state 's own onsite monitoring .	brewer has held state government 's top elected office since becoming governor in january 2009 when democrat janet napolitano resigned to join president barack obama 's cabinet .	brewer is now running for a full term in a race that has focused so far on the state 's economic and budget troubles as well as border security and illegal immigration .	but the prison break began emerging as an issue in mid-august when legislators reported for a special session on an unrelated ballot measure championed by majority republicans .	minority democrats called the special session a waste of time and said lawmakers should have spent the time focusing on prison security in the wake of the escape .	some republicans agreed that oversight hearings would be a good idea but others said the democrats were just engaging in political posturing . "	i find that offensive .	when is it time to ask these questions ?	how many times do we have to let people escape before we figure out what 's going on , " said rep. chad campbell , d-phoenix . "	i think the voters need to figure out what 's going on . "	the issue continued to simmer as lawmakers awaited the promised release of a department of corrections report into the circumstances of the escape .	democratic lawmakers accused brewer 's administration of delaying its release , a charge that corrections director charles ryan called unfounded .	ryan released the report thursday as he acknowledged that the department 's own monitoring failed to detect faulty alarms , poor staffing practices and other flaws , let alone correct them .	senate president bob burns , r-peoria , said the state 's probe found an " obvious breakdown of security " that warrants revamping the state 's monitoring of private prisons ' operations .	but he resisted the idea of holding legislative hearings , at least for now . "	you would have too many people trying to interject politics into the hearing , and i do n't think that 's healthy , " said burns , who said he supports use of private prisons as a way to provide cost-saving competition for public facilities .	politically for brewer , " i 'm sure it puts a nick in her armor but my opinion is we 're dealing with a lot of bad people in prison and a lot of them are looking for ways to get out , " burns said .	brewer herself said lax security at the kingman prison was unacceptable . "	i know the people of arizona are concerned and we are going to resolve it , " she said .	the state should continue to use private prisons but they must be held to the same level of accountability as public facilities , brewer said . "	this basically is an incident that was unacceptable and we are getting to the bottom of it and we will pursue and remedy it . "	attorney general terry goddard , the presumptive democratic nominee for governor , said the escape " shined a bright light on inadequate prison security , on improper assignment of convicted murders to facilities not meant for such dangerous criminals , and arizona 's over-reliance on for-profit prisons . "	brewer needs to do more to tighten security and the operations of private prisons , goddard said . "	what we have in arizona is a climate of permissiveness . "	goddard will try to use the escape to weaken brewer 's support and " may make some headway as this issue allows him to take some focus off of immigration for the time being , " said fred solop , a northern arizona university political science professor .	but the issue should n't have a major effect if brewer acknowledges problems with the kingman prison , responds to them and then focuses on other campaign topics , solop said . "	ultimately , goddard wo n't be able to go very far with this issue . "	goddard is unopposed for the democratic nomination for governor in tuesday ' primary election , while brewer faces only a little-known moderate and a conservative who has stopped active campaigning .
two weeks before election day , democrats fear their grip on the house of representatives may be gone , and republicans are poised to celebrate big gains in the senate and governors ' mansions as well .	analysts in both parties say all major indicators tilt toward the republicans .	president barack obama 's policies are widely unpopular .	congress , run by the democrats , rates even lower .	fear and anger over unemployment and deep deficits are energizing conservative voters ; liberals are demoralized .	private groups are pouring huge sums of money into republican campaigns .	an almost dizzying series of democratic messages has failed to gain traction , forcing obama to zigzag in search of a winning formula .	with the nov. 2 election quickly nearing , obama is campaigning coast to coast , raising money for candidates and looking to energize democratic voters whose enthusiasm has waned since the 2008 presidential election .	but obama acknowledges that even in the most reliably liberal states , no democratic candidate is guaranteed victory in november .	that helps explain obama 's scheduled appearance saturday afternoon at a boston rally for massachusetts gov. deval patrick , a longtime friend and political ally .	republicans have tried to use patrick 's close relationship with the president as a campaign wedge against the incumbent seeking a second term .	with early voting under way in many states , democrats are trying to minimize the damage by concentrating their resources on a dwindling number of races . "	the poll numbers and the enthusiasm on the right versus the lack of the enthusiasm on the left suggest a pretty big republican night , " said former nebraska sen. bob kerrey , who once headed the democratic senatorial campaign committee .	with democrats in power while the unemployment rate stands at 9.6 percent , " it 's difficult to say , ' well it could have been worse , ' " kerrey said .	governing parties typically lose seats in the so-called midterm elections , which take place in the middle of a president 's four-year term , but this november democratic losses are likely to be particularly severe .	polls , campaign finance reports and advisers in both parties indicate that republicans are in line to seize on a level of voter discontent that rivals 1994 , when the republicans gained the house majority for the first time in 40 years .	democrats are embattled at every level .	house of representaves : republicans need to win 40 seats to regain the house majority they lost four years ago .	even some democratic officials acknowledge that their losses could well exceed that .	a republican takeover would depose rep. nancy pelosi as the first female house speaker and force obama to negotiate with republicans on every significant legislative issue .	every day brings fresh evidence of democratic officials virtually abandoning house members whose re-election bids seem hopeless .	republicans are expanding the field to pursue races that once appeared unattainable .	in the coming week , republicans or supportive outside groups plan to spend money in 82 house races that they see as competitive or within reach of a last-minute upset .	all 435 house seats are on the ballot .	democrats , desperate to hold their losses to three dozen seats , plan to run tv ads in 59 races in the remaining days .	but their chief house campaign committee has recently canceled millions of dollars worth of advertising for struggling reps. steve driehaus and mary jo kilroy of ohio , suzanne kosmas of florida , betsy markey of colorado and steve kagen of wisconsin .	they are shifting some of that money to incumbents once considered safe , such as arizona rep. raul grijalva .	but in a sign of the election 's volatility , they also are helping viable incumbents they had expected to be trailing significantly ?	south dakota rep. stephanie herseth sandlin , for example .	the democrats ' house campaign committee raised almost $ 16 million in september and has $ 41.6 million in the bank .	that 's a big fundraising advantage over the republicans ' house campaign committee .	but the figures are misleading because heavy spending by outside groups , which often hide their donors ' identities , clearly favors republican candidates .
federal prosecutors and lawyers for boston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev were due in court for a status hearing on motions that include defense requests to move the trial outside of massachusetts and delay the trial 's start by at least 10 months .	u.s. district judge george o'toole jr. was expected to discuss the motions during the hearing on thursday .	tsarnaev , 21 , has pleaded not guilty in the 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260 .	he could face the death penalty .	prosecutors allege that tsarnaev and his older borther , tamerlan , detonated two pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon 's finish line .	tamerlan tsarnaev was killed during a shootout with police several days after the bombings .	tsarnaev 's trial is currently scheduled to begin in november .	his attorneys have argued that they need more time to review the large volume of evidence turned over by prosecutors .	they say the november trial date would give them about half the median preparation time allowed other defendants facing a federal death sentence over the past decade .	the defense argues that the trial should be moved outside the state , citing the emotional impact the bombing had on many local residents .	tsarnaev 's lawyers have also filed motions to suppress physical evidence and electronically stored evidence .	prosecutors have filed a motion asking the judge to order the defense to disclose " mitigating factors " it intends to cite in arguments against the death penalty if tsarnaev is convicted .
general election days would no longer be a paid holiday for state employees under a bill endorsed by the house .	house bill 431 by republican rep. keith regier of kalispell passed on a 64-35 vote tuesday .	it faces a final house vote before going to the senate .	regier says his constituents have expressed frustration at state government being closed that day .	democratic rep. diane sands of missoula opposed the bill , saying many state and local government employees work as election judges , and ending the holiday would make it harder for election officials to find judges .	lee newspapers of montana reports there was little debate on the bill .

the new hampshire republican party headquarters has been vandalized by someone who apparently supports president barack obama 's health care overhaul law .	the state gop says the message : " wwjd ?	healthcare for everyone " was found spray painted on the side of the building in concord on friday .	executive director matt slater on monday blamed the graffiti on " cowardly extremists " trying to spread a liberal agenda by damaging property instead of engaging in serious debate .	the state committee has reported the incident to police and is seeking estimates to determine cleaning or repair costs .
( ap ) ?	a west virginia sheriff was charged monday with illegal wiretapping , accused of hacking his former wife 's work computer in the clay county magistrate court office .	clay county sheriff miles j. slack was charged in a federal information filed in u.s. district court in charleston .	the document typically signals the defendant is cooperating with the investigation .	u.s. attorney booth goodwin said slack secretly installed a keystroke logger on a government-owned computer in april , when he and his wife were still married .	prosecutors would n't immediately comment on the motive , but the couple has since divorced .	goodwin said the machine that slack 's wife worked on belongs to the state supreme court of appeals and is connected to a statewide computer network .	the spying device remained in place for two weeks , he said , and slack successfully intercepted emails , messages and other data from the computer .	slack did n't immediately return a message left at his office , but county commission president mike pierson said the sheriff has not resigned .	whether he will is unclear , but the commission is prepared to appoint a temporary successor within 24 hours of that decision , pierson said . "	we knew it was probably coming , " he said . "	we just did n't know when . "	state law does not require a sheriff to resign while facing charges .	last year , a sheriff in jefferson county ran for and won re-election while facing criminal charges in the beating of a bank robbery suspect , so it could be some time before slack is forced to resign . "	we really like miles slack .	he has worked with the commission .	he 's done a good job ?	much better than the previous sheriff , " pierson said .

a jury cleared atlantic city councilman marty small and five co-defendants of all charges monday in a voter fraud trial in which they had been accused of trying to steal the 2009 democratic mayoral primary by tampering with absentee ballots .	it was the second time in five years that small was found innocent of voter fraud .	he was acquitted of similar charges in 2006 involving a mayoral election in which he was not a candidate " these were trumped-up charges from the very beginning , " said small , who left the courtroom teary-eyed and loudly clapping his hands together .	referring to the two juries who have acquitted him in separate trials five years apart , small said , " there 's 30 different people ?	total strangers ?	that have told the state to take their charges and run somewhere .	i was hoping for a fair jury and i knew they would do the right thing . "	small must decide within a month whether to run for re-election for his city council seat , and said he has not decided whether he will again seek to become mayor of the nation 's second-largest gambling resort in two years . "	i 'm not sure of any political aspirations , to be honest , " he said . "	that 's a decision i 'll have to make with my family . "	the trial had spanned more than five months .	small and four campaign volunteers ?	laquay zahir , floyd tally , tracy pijuan , toni dixon and james quirk ?	had been accused of trying to steal the june 2009 democratic mayoral primary election by tampering with or manipulating absentee ballots intended for voters who were confined at home or too ill to make it to the polls on election day .	small was trounced in the election by incumbent mayor lorenzo langford .	in an indictment handed up in september 2009 , and in their opening statements at the trial , the attorney general 's office said it would show the defendants had formed what they called " the secret army " of conspirators bent on stealing the election through absentee ballot fraud .	each of the defendants was charged with conspiracy , election fraud , absentee ballot fraud , tampering with public records , falsifying records , and forgery .	several also were charged with hindering apprehension relating to allegedly false testimony they gave to a grand jury .	when the charges were announced , it shone a renewed spotlight on a city renowned for political corruption dating back a century .	the hit hbo series " boardwalk empire " chronicled the exploits of nucky johnson , the resort 's real-life political and rackets boss who made sure vices of every type were protected in atlantic city through paid-off authorities in the 1920s and '30s .	in recent decades , numerous atlantic city councilmen and mayors were arrested on corruption charges .	but in small 's case , little of what was promised by the prosecution materialized in the trial , and some of the state 's star witnesses fizzled .	one became ill on the witness stand , suddenly rushing to the bathroom during testimony , then appearing to try to vomit into a trash can in the courtroom .	another witness , a cocaine dealer who secretly recorded numerous conversations with small and others that were a large part of the prosecution 's case , appeared to have dozed off on the witness stand at one point , although there was vehement disagreement between the defense and prosecution over whether he was actually sleeping .	that witness , eddie colon , had been facing a prison sentence of 20 years to life before reaching a plea deal with prosecutors that could have him out of jail in as little as six months .	the defense said colon had every incentive to lie and say whatever the state wanted him to say in order to shorten his prison term .	prosecutors said the only obligation colon had was to testify truthfully . "	we are disappointed but must respect the verdict of the jury , " attorney general paula dow said . "	the prosecutors , detectives and other personnel assigned to this case gave it their all in the interest of safeguarding fair elections and the fundamental right of citizens to vote .	i commend them for the skill and dedication with which they conducted this trial and the underlying investigation .

virginia gov. terry mcauliffe announced scaled back plans monday to increase health care coverage for the state 's poor , but it will not provide coverage for the vast majority of the 400,000 low-income adults who would have been eligible for an expanded medicaid program .	the only low-income adults eligible for new health coverage under mcauliffe 's plans would be about 20,000 currently uninsured residents who have a severe mental illness .	the governor has made expanding medicaid using mostly federal funds a top priority and has repeatedly promised that he would do so .	but he said monday that he does not have the authority to do it without the general assembly , where the republican majority staunchly opposes expansion . "	trust me , if i could do this on my own i would do it , " mcauliffe said at a capitol news conference .	he added that he 's not giving up on expansion and remains optimistic that it can be done in the future .	in place of medicaid expansion , mcauliffe announced a 10-point plan monday aimed at encouraging adults and children already eligible for publicly subsidized health care coverage to enroll in various programs .	the state and the federal government would each pay about $ 80 million a year to cover the costs of new coverage for uninsured residents with a severe mental illness .	the plan still has to be approved by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services .	the governor also plans to begin including dental coverage for about 45,000 pregnant women who already receive publicly funded health care and to allow state workers to enroll their children famis , an insurance program for low-income children whose families do n't qualify for medicaid .

as yet another school year unfolds , some students may bemoan the end of a long summer break .	but students at city high charter school , downtown , have had to adjust to a shorter break ?	just one month ?	because the school operates on a year-round calendar . "	i was n't used to being in school that long , but i got used to it , " said angelo carr , a junior .	rick wertheimer , principal and co-founder of the school that opened in 2002 , said , " we just do n't think it 's healthy for a student to spend 11 weeks out of their academic routine .	that 's when they develop bad habits again . "	city high is part of a movement to lengthen the time students spend in school and use it strategically .	its calendar includes 186 days of instruction ?	longer than many other public schools ?	and about a month off three times a year .	the push for more time in school has won supporters as prominent as president barack obama , who last year said the typical american school day puts the nation at a competitive disadvantage over countries where students spend more time in school . "	we can no longer afford an academic calendar designed when america was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day , " obama said .	the comparison has been a repeated refrain since 1983 , when a u.s. department of education report , " a nation at risk , " concluded that the lackluster amount of time ?	and poor use of it ?	in american schools is one of a number of factors that contribute to " a rising tide of mediocrity " in the u.s. education system .	the report found that american students spend about six hours a day for 180 days a year in school compared to their peers in some other countries who spend at least eight hours a day for 220 days a year in class .	in pennsylvania , the norm is around 180 days .	adding time has been a tough sell , given the economics of paying teachers more to teach a longer day and the practical realities of winning support for shorter summers or less time for after-school activities and jobs .	but despite the hurdles , some local schools still have added instructional time beyond the traditional amount , including charter schools throughout the county as well as select schools operated by pittsburgh public schools and woodland hills .	some districts , such as duquesne and south allegheny , are adding from five to 15 minutes districtwide to their days this year .	pennsylvania schools must meet state-required minimums : 450 instructional hours in kindergarten , 900 in elementary schools and 990 in secondary schools .	nationwide , the boston-based national center on time and learning , which is dedicated to expanding learning time , last year counted 655 schools in 36 states that provide extra time , on average 25 percent more than the national norm .	adding time , in and of itself , is not enough . "	it absolutely matters what you do with extra time when you have it , " said jennifer davis , president of the national center on time and learning .	the challenge for school administrators , she said , is how to incorporate additional time into all aspects of their academic programs .	that is what the high-performing charter schools do particularly well , said davis . "	they do n't just add time .	they focus on individual student support as they build dynamic class scheduling models .	that allows for flexibility in instruction , one-on-one teacher interaction with students , and they train teachers on how best to utilize additional time . "	they make time for intervention with students who are falling behind , and , most of all , they make time to actually get through subject material , " davis said .	at city high , dr. wertheimer said , " everything we do here is driven by the fact that we have an unconventional system and all of it is built around our time structure . "	the school has six hours and 15 minutes of instruction a day ?	more than some other high schools in allegheny county ?	not counting time spent on activities such as lunch and class changes .	classes are scheduled in blocks of time to allow more in-depth work .	the school practices " looping , " keeping students with the same teachers all four years so there 's no get-acquainted period at the beginning of each year . "	for us , we hit the ground running .	because of it , we almost gain a whole month of instruction time at the start of school , " wertheimer said .	last year , city high was honored with a national award from the nonprofit new leaders for new schools .	on this spring 's pennsylvania system of school assessment tests , 72 percent were proficient or advanced in reading and 51 percent in math .	but it narrowly missed making the federal performance standard , adequate yearly progress , known as ayp .	woodland hills academy , a k-8 school created by the woodland hills school district last year , also has a longer year built around three terms .	its calendar includes 195 school days , a week off in november , two weeks off in december and six weeks off in the summer .	the extra time helps the school to schedule an expanded period for reading in the morning and one for math in the afternoon as well as to offer additional classes ?	such as spanish , fly-fishing , sign language and computers .	there also is time for teacher-student counseling and activities such as musicals .	academy principal reginald hickman said the additional time has helped to boost the school 's first scores on state tests taken in the spring .	on the pssa , 69 percent of students scored proficient or advanced in reading and 86 percent in math .	what 's more , hickman said , test results also showed that the academy essentially erased the achievement gap between blacks and other students .	in fall 2006 , pittsburgh public schools opened eight accelerated learning academies , using additional time as a vehicle to raise academic achievement .	academy students have six hours and 40 minutes of instructional time on a regular school day , longer than many other city schools .	they also have 10 more days of instruction than other district schools .	christiana otuwa , the assistant superintendent who oversees the academies , said an extra 45 minutes was added into the schools ' schedules specifically for intervention , enrichment and workshop periods .	some suburban school districts also are adding time to their schedules .	the duquesne city school district ?	which has only a k-8 school ?	is adding 15 minutes to its day each year under a three-year contract .	by 2011-12 , teachers will be working an extra 45 minutes a day .	the time will be blended into the schedule depending on " where the principal thinks he needs extra time , " said sarah mccluan , spokeswoman of the allegheny intermediate unit , which runs the duquesne school .	in the south allegheny school district , an instructional day was added to the school calendar and an extra five minutes of instructional time was added onto the daily schedule starting this fall .	another four minutes will be added next fall .	once it assesses students , north allegheny school district in october will add an hour in an extended-day pilot program for kindergarten students who need extra help with literacy skills .	the program will start in two of the district 's seven elementary schools ?	peebles and mcknight ?	and may be expanded , depending on its success .	aside from longer days , one way to add time is to reduce the length of summer vacation .	this idea is increasingly a focus for school reformers who contend that academically dormant students fall behind over the long summer break .	but a challenge to overcoming " summer loss " is creating academic summer programs that will entice children who would rather have the summer off .	pittsburgh public schools used a mix of academics and activities ?	ranging from boating to sculpture classes ?	to attract about 1,200 students daily to voluntarily attend its first five-week summer camp called summer dreamers academy .	funded with $ 10 million of federal stimulus funds for two years , the camp will return next summer , but future funding is uncertain . "	summer programming is the next frontier for us as an education system .	we have to stop thinking of it as ancillary time , " pittsburgh public schools superintendent mark roosevelt said .	while summer and after-school programs often are optional , pittsburgh also is looking at extending the required school day and year at two more schools , westinghouse , which will serve grades 6-12 next fall in two single-gender academies , and oliver high school , which will partner with community college of allegheny county , also next fall .	but questions of expanding the school day and year ultimately have to be negotiated with the teacher union , said john tarka , president of the pittsburgh federation of teachers .	what 's more , tarka said , the addition of time ought to come with realistic expectations . "	lengthening the day without planning for it wo n't accomplish much , " he said .

president obama 's health care reforms will be a huge boost to the working poor but are likely to make life more expensive for aaron brethorst and others like him .	the seattle software developer and consultant does n't have a problem with that because he figures he 'll be able to afford quality insurance .	he says his annual income is in the low six-figures , and he expects to receive better coverage once the affordable care act kicks in .	the 31-year-old says the ability to buy his own health insurance , because he is relatively young and healthy , has given him the creative freedom to start his own companies and explore new ideas .	he spends a little more than $ 300 a month on catastrophic coverage with a high deductible .	he recently got an email from his health insurance company informing him that the plan he bought on the individual market is going to be cancelled .	brethorst said he does not know whether he will buy his next policy from the same company ?	a local version of blue cross ?	or through the state insurance exchange , the washington healthplan finder .	he does expect to add a better dental and vision plan in the new year , however . "	i 'm not worried about it , quite frankly , " brethorst said . "	my income today is more than enough to pay for health insurance . "	that outlook is not likely to be universal among those who are self-employed .	the income threshold for a government subsidy offered on the state exchanges varies based on a number of factors , but generally tops out at $ 46,000 a year for an individual .	depending on their health , age , family circumstances and income , the cost of insurance could become a burden for those who make too much money for government subsidies but not enough to be considered well-off .	insurance companies say the cost of their polices will have to reflect the new government mandates under the affordable care act , including the requirement to cover all people , regardless of their medical condition , and to provide coverage for 10 new essential benefits that include mental health treatment and maternity care .	glen melnick , a health economist at the university of southern california , said he believes many younger singles who are self-employed will decide against buying health insurance despite the government mandate , opting instead to pay the fine . "	they 're going to decide not to play .	they are risk-takers to begin with , " he said .	yet the additional benefits under the law could outweigh the added costs for some , said dylan roby , assistant professor and researcher at the university of california , los angeles center for health policy research .	another positive of the federal reforms is the ability to more easily comparison-shop between insurance companies and policies , he said .	brethorst said the affordable care act is likely to provide freedom to those who currently can not afford to escape employer-based coverage to pursue their own dreams .	the iphone app developer and business consultant cites as an example a friend and colleague with asthma .	they started a new company together a few years ago while his friend was buying his insurance from a former employer through the federal cobra plan .	when the venture capital funding they were seeking fell through before his access to company health insurance ran out , brethorst 's friend left for another company job where he could get health insurance as an employee . "	we 've been talking about working together again at some point , " brethorst said . "	once these provisions go into effect , it 's going to be significantly easier to go off and pursue his entrepreneurial dreams . "	contact donna blankinship at https://twitter.com/dgblankinship

millions across the mid-atlantic region sweltered in the aftermath of violent storms that pummeled the eastern u.s. with high winds and downed trees , killing at least 13 people and leaving 3 million without power during a heat wave .	power officials said saturday the outages would n't be repaired for several days to a week , likening the damage to a serious hurricane .	emergencies were declared in maryland , west virginia , ohio , the district of columbia and virginia , where gov. bob mcdonnell said the state had its largest non-hurricane outage in history , as more storms threatened . "	this is a very dangerous situation , " the governor said .	in west virginia , 232 amtrak passengers spent friday night on a train that was blocked on both sides by trees that fell on the tracks , and they were waiting for buses to pick them up saturday .	in illinois , storm damage forced the transfer of dozens of maximum-security , mentally ill prisoners from one prison to another .	in some virginia suburbs of washington , emergency call centers were out of service ; residents were told to call local police and fire departments .	huge trees fell across streets in washington , leaving cars crunched up next to them , and onto the fairway at the at&t national golf tournament in maryland .	cell phone and internet service was spotty , gas stations shut down and residents were urged to conserve water until sewage plants returned to power .	the outages were especially dangerous because they left the region without air conditioning in an oppressive heat .	temperatures soared to highs in the mid-90s in baltimore and washington , where it had hit 104 ( 40 celsius ) on friday . "	i 've called everybody except for the state police to try to get power going , " said karen fryer , resident services director at two assisted living facilities in washington .	the facilities had generator power , but needed to go out for portable air conditioning units , and fryer worried about a few of her 100 residents who needed backup power for portable oxygen .	on saturday night , the train passengers stranded near rural prince , west virginia , were loaded into buses after they got stuck at 11 p.m. the previous evening , said amtrak spokesman steve kulm .	kulm said the train bound from new york to chicago had power , so lights and air conditioning were working .	he said that since it 's a long-distance train , it was stocked with food and crew members were able to get to town to buy more .	about 170 miles ( 274 kilometers ) to the northeast in morgantown , west virginia , jeff and alice haney loaded their cart at lowe 's with cases of water , extra flashlights and batteries , and wiring for the generator they hoped would be enough to kick-start their air conditioner .	even if they had to live without cool air , the family had a backup plan . "	we have a pool , " jeff haney said , " so we 'll be ok . "	the storm did damage from indiana to new jersey , although the bulk of it was in west virginia , washington and suburban virginia and maryland .	at least six of the dead were killed in virginia , including a 90-year-old woman asleep in bed when a tree slammed into her home .	two young cousins in new jersey were killed when a tree fell on their tent while camping .	two were killed in maryland , one in ohio , one in kentucky and one in washington .	illinois corrections officials transferred 78 inmates from a prison in dixon to the pontiac correctional center after storms friday night caused significant damage , department of corrections spokeswoman stacey solano said .	no one was injured , solano said .	generators are providing power to the prison , which is locked down , confining remaining inmates to their cells .	utility officials said it could take at least several days to restore power to all customers because of the sheer magnitude of the outages and the destruction .	winds and toppled trees brought down entire power lines , and debris has to be cleared from power stations and other structures .	all of that takes time and ca n't be accomplished with the flip of a switch .

federal officials said friday that initial water quality tests show levels of toxic chemicals are declining after a gasoline-like substance was detected seeping into a creek from a denver-area refinery , but environmentalists said even one barrel of the toxic brew is too much .	an initial report the environmental protection agency released friday says the chemicals are rapidly dissipating because of evaporation and dilution .	the agency 's final report is expected to take up to 10 days .	the seep from the suncor energy refinery into sand creek was detected this week , and officials were concerned it would flow into the south platte river , which a major source of drinking water , wildlife habitat and agricultural water for colorado and nebraska .	gasoline contains known and suspected carcinogens , the epa said , and the hazardous chemicals found in the creek include benzene and toluene .	matthew allen , spokesman for the epa , said the decreasing levels are good news because they show the containment efforts are working .	jeremy nichols of the environmental advocacy group wildearth guardians disputed that , saying the evaporation of dangerous chemicals into the air and dilution of major water supplies are still hazardous . "	we do n't want it going into the air or into the water , " nichols said .	the group sent a notice to suncor energy inc. on friday giving the calgary , alberta , company 60 days to resolve the issues or face legal action under the clean air act and clean water act .	the epa said crews have recovered between 20 and 50 gallons of an oily substance , but it was unclear how much may have seeped into the creek or made it into the river .	john gallagher , suncor energy usa vice president , said the cleanup efforts have made a significant improvement on the creek and river .	he said the evaporation and dilution is only occurring in a small part of the waterways and is " neither a health hazard or a concern . "	epa spokesman curtis kimbel said friday some of the contamination has reached the south platte , but people downstream have been notified and no problems were reported .	the epa has blocked public access to the contamination zone .	wildlife officials said there is no indication the spill has harmed animals .	kimbel said suncor is building a 3-foot-wide , 230-foot-long trench to capture the chemicals , with a goal of stopping the contamination before cleanup begins .	suncor says a crew of about 60 people working around the clock has stopped the material from getting into the creek .	suncor 's refinery produces jet fuel , gasoline , diesel fuel , and asphalt , mostly from oil from colorado and wyoming .	colorado state health officials fear that a leaky underground pipe that leads to a tank at the refinery might have leaked a " sizable " amount of petroleum near the south platte river .	the leak reported by the refinery this summer is about a half-mile away from where an oily substance began seeping into sand creek on monday .	more tests are needed to confirm the leak is the source .
nutritional supplement maker usana health sciences inc. said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 21 percent , helped in part by strong sales growth from the asia pacific region and a lower effective tax rate .	shares of the company slid in morning trading , however , as earnings missed estimates and usana issued a weak forecast .	the salt lake city company earned $ 12.4 million , or 75 cents per share , in the quarter that ended jan. 1 .	that compares with earnings of $ 10.2 million , or 66 cents per share , in the prior-year quarter .	revenue rose 18 percent to $ 137.5 million .	analysts surveyed by factset expected , on average , earnings of 82 cents per share on $ 136 million in revenue .	usana said tuesday the newly acquired babycare operation in china and favorable currency exchange rate changes added more than $ 7 million in sales during the quarter .	asia pacific region sales grew nearly 40 percent to $ 78 million , mainly due to strong growth in hong kong , the philippines and japan .	in contrast , north american sales fell 2 percent to $ 59.6 million .	selling , general and administrative expenses climbed 36 percent to $ 33.4 million .	for the full year , usana earned $ 45.7 million , or $ 2.86 per share , on $ 517.6 million in revenue .	the company expects 2011 earnings per share of between $ 2.85 and $ 2.95 on between $ 530 million and $ 550 million in revenue .	analysts , on average , expect earnings of $ 3.37 per share on $ 569.8 million in revenue .	shares fell $ 6.87 , or 17 percent , to $ 33.34 .

although rep. gabrielle giffords and one of her staff members who survived the tucson mass shooting were the ones being recognized at an awards ceremony friday , the talk of the day was more about the staff member who did n't make it , 30-year-old gabe zimmerman .	the national conference on citizenship awarded giffords with its franklin award for federal service at a ceremony at arizona state university in tempe .	giffords was not at the ceremony and was continuing therapy in houston .	ron barber , giffords ' district director who survived the shooting , received a civic engagement award from the center for the future of arizona , and made it to the ceremony with several other staff members .	the inaugural award is named for zimmerman , who was one of six killed in the shooting .	giffords ' husband , astronaut mark kelly , said in a videotaped statement that public servants are far too often overlooked , underappreciated and " used as punching bags , " and that they should get more credit for the work they do .	he pointed to zimmerman in particular , saying that he was the second person giffords hired to be on her congressional staff in 2007 and that she always thought of him as a little brother .	kelly said zimmerman was kind , compassionate , fiercely loyal to giffords and loved helping people as her community outreach director .	zimmerman was known affectionately among the staff as giffords ' " constituent whisperer , " for never losing patience with those who lost their tempers .	emily nottingham , zimmerman 's mother , was at the ceremony with her husband and told the associated press that if her son were alive , he would at first be embarrassed that an award was named for him , but then proud that public servants were being recognized . "	it 's easy to vilify or belittle public servants , and i think that 's it 's one of those things that contributes to a society that can be more civil , " she said .	as for how nottingham and her family are coping with zimmerman 's death , now almost nine months ago , she said " it changes your life forever , but the community has been very responsive and supportive . "	kelly and giffords ' staff also spoke about how the congresswoman is doing , with barber praising her for being able to walk on her own , gaining back every ounce of curiosity she had before the shooting and making constant progress .	elaine richardson , giffords ' longtime friend and bridesmaid and a former state senator , accepted the congresswoman 's award for her at the ceremony .	she told ap afterward that she misses talking to giffords on a daily basis like she used to and is planning to see her " shortly , " adding that giffords needs " girlfriend time . " "	if anybody can do something and get better , it 'll be gabby , " she said , noting that giffords was never afraid of anything and used to rollerblade to her house as a youngster as late as midnight . "	what i 'm looking forward to is her healing completely , and for me , her running for office is a back-burner issue . "

muslim groups and civil liberties advocates applauded the decision by new york police department officials to disband a controversial unit that tracked the daily lives of muslims as part of efforts to detect terror threats , but said there were concerns about whether other problematic practices remained in place .	the demographics unit , conceived with the help of a cia agent working with the nypd , assembled databases on where muslims lived , shopped , worked and prayed .	plainclothes officers infiltrated muslim student groups , put informants in mosques , monitored sermons and catalogued muslims in new york who adopted new , americanized surnames .	nypd spokesman stephen davis confirmed tuesday that detectives assigned to the unit had been transferred to other duties within the department 's intelligence division .	linda sarsour , the executive director of the arab american association of new york , said she was among a group of advocates at a private meeting last week with police at which the department 's new intelligence chief , john miller , first indicated the unit ?	renamed the zone assessment unit ?	was n't viable .	she applauded the decision but said there 's still concern about the police use of informants to infiltrate mosques without specific evidence of crime . "	this was definitely a part of the big puzzle that we 're trying to get dismantled , " sarsour said .	but , she added , " this does n't necessarily prove to us yet that these very problematic practices are going to end . "	another person at the meeting , fahd ahmed , legal and policy director of desis rising up and moving , called the decision " a small step . "	he questioned what had happened to the information gathered by the unit . "	the concern was n't just about the fact that this data was being collected secretly ?	it was about the fact that this data was being collected at all , " he said .	the nypd 's decision to disband the unit was first reported in the new york times .	an ongoing review of the division by new police commissioner william bratton found that the same information collected by the unit could be better collected through direct contact with community groups , officials said .	in a statement , mayor bill de blasio , a democrat , called the move " a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve , so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys . "	since taking office , de blasio has taken other steps toward changing how the police department operates , like ending the city 's appeal of a judge 's ruling ordering major reforms to the department 's implementation of a controversial street stop policy including the implementation of the first-ever inspector general for the nypd .	after a series of stories by the associated press detailing the extent of the nypd 's surveillance of muslims , two civil rights lawsuits were filed challenging the activities as unconstitutional because they focused on people 's religion , national origin and race .	former police commissioner ray kelly had defended the surveillance tactics , saying officers observed legal guidelines while attempting to create an early warning system for terrorism .	but in a deposition made public in 2012 , an nypd chief testified that the unit 's work had never generated a lead or triggered a terrorism investigation in the previous six years .	in washington , 34 members of congress had demanded a federal investigation into the nypd 's actions .	attorney general eric holder said he was disturbed by reports about the operations , and the department of justice said it was reviewing complaints received from muslims and their supporters .	the ap 's reporting also prompted an investigation by the cia 's inspector general .	that internal inquiry concluded that the cia , which is prohibited from domestic spying , had n't broken any laws , but it criticized the agency for allowing an officer assigned to the nypd to operate without sufficient supervision .	the center for constitutional rights in new york and the california-based muslim advocates , which represented eight muslims from new jersey in a 2012 lawsuit challenging the spying program , welcomed the unit 's dismantling but expressed concern it would n't stop the surveillance in muslim communities . "	but nothing in the city 's announcement definitively suggests they will put an end to broad surveillance practices , which would continue to be illegal regardless of which department within the nypd might be engaged in it , " they said in a statement .	new york civil liberties union executive director donna lieberman said police-community relations took a blow from the nypd unit 's broad surveillance of all muslims , not just people suspected of wrongdoing . "	we hope this means an end to the dragnet approach to policing that has been so harmful to police-community relations and a commitment to going after criminal suspicion , rather than innocent new yorkers , " said lieberman , whose organization is involved in lawsuits over the practice .
georgia lawmakers revisited a divisive argument over legalizing medical marijuana on wednesday , as parents pleaded for something to help children with seizure disorders and representatives of law enforcement and conservative groups warned of unintended consequences .	members of a study committee met for the final time on wednesday in atlanta , with some lining up behind different proposals on the issue that will arise again in the 2015 legislative session that begins in january .	republican rep. allen peake , who spearheaded last session 's failed effort to pass a bill aimed at helping children with seizure disorders , pre-filed a bill last month to allow limited use of medical cannabis in georgia .	peake said he expects to have a draft bill by christmas , or at the latest by the jan. 12 start to the session .	he has said the bill will allow a limited number of businesses to get a state license to grow and process marijuana to provide cannabis oil to people with certain medical conditions under tight regulations .	peake has said he also wants to limit the amount of the tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc , compound that makes users feel a high . "	we must act now , " peake told committee members , after listing the names of children whose parents have lobbied for a medical marijuana law .	democratic state sen. curt thompson separately filed a bill allowing broader use of medical marijuana , including licensing some patients to grow plants , and a resolution to amend the state constitution and legalize the drug in limited amounts for people older than 21 .	thompson told committee members that georgia lawmakers should consider people with serious illnesses who need treatment . "	i hope we take what we 've learned and put that to use , " he said .	opposition has come from a variety of circles during the hearings , including the prosecuting attorneys ' council of georgia .	executive director chuck spahos said no one wants to prosecute a family looking to help their sick child , but law enforcement officials have concerns about federal law that classifies marijuana as an illegal drug . "	we do n't want to stand in the way of oil being available for treatment , but we ca n't disregard federal law , " he said .	after last session 's bill failed over unrelated legislation , gov. nathan deal announced a clinical trial partnership between georgia regents university and a pharmaceutical company .	university officials have said they have some federal approvals and hope to begin accepting patients soon .
the increase means the total amount the state will budget for payments next year will be $ 7.9 billion , when the new fiscal year begins july 1 .	but the report noted that the increase is a smaller hike than last year , when state pension contributions increased by $ 681 million .	the information came in a report released thursday by the general assembly 's commission on government forecasting and accountability .	the figures cover five pension systems , including the teachers ' retirement system , which accounts for almost $ 62 billion of the unfunded liability .	dan long , the commission 's executive director , told the ( springfield ) state journal register ( http://bit.ly/1lt7vb6 ) said the nearly $ 8 billion that the state needs to budget for pension payments in fiscal 2017 is worrisome because it takes a huge chunk out of illinois ' general fund budget , which is made up of income and sales taxes . "	the issue is the state contribution is about 24 percent of the general fund , " long told the newspaper .	the pension liability has ballooned to its current amount after decades of underfunding .	the report comes as legislative leaders and gov. bruce rauner have agreed to take another look at overhauling pensions .	the illinois supreme court rejected a previous plan that lawmakers said would save the state billions in contributions .	the leaders met earlier this week , as the state continues to operate without a budget for the fiscal year that began in july .	the governor and top legislative officials have agreed to meet again next week .	even without a budget , state pension payments need to be made .
north carolina house republicans are trying to pass legislation that demands people show photo identification before they enter a voting booth , even though it appears the measure would face a veto from gov. beverly perdue .	the house returned thursday to debate further a politically divisive voter id bill after the republican-led chamber conducted the first of two required votes just before midnight wednesday following just a few minutes of debate .	the bill was tentatively approved on a 67-50 party-line vote , but the gop margin falls a few votes shy of overcoming any potential veto .	perdue 's office has been critical of the legislation , and democrats and voting rights advocates have called it a veiled method to suppress voting among blacks , older adults and women .	house speaker thom tillis , r-mecklenburg , said the measure is about responding to complaints from constituents worried about illegal voting .	republicans made voter id a part of their campaign platform last fall as they took control of both the house and senate for the first time in 140 years .	gop leaders in other states are pushing similar legislation , but a chief sponsor of the north carolina legislation said there 's no national conspiracy to boost gop candidates with the ballot restrictions . "	when the election is fair , the votes are cast fairly , it protects everyone , " said rep. david lewis , r-harnett , at the start of thursday 's debate . "	it just does n't protect one side of the aisle or the other side of the aisle .	it protects everyone equally . "	the measure , called " restore confidence in government , " would still have to pass the senate before it goes to perdue .	earlier this week , perdue communications director chrissy pearson said it appeared " republicans are attempting to disenfranchise citizens who may not agree with their political point of view . "	the bill would demand a voter provide one of eight forms of photo id , including new , free voter cards that would be generated by county elections boards .	a person who does n't have a photo id could cast a provisional ballot and go later to county elections officials to prove their identity .	the division of motor vehicles also would issue special non-driver id cards for free to people who do n't have another form of identification .	democrats argue voter id legislation is a solution in search of a problem that does n't exist and would cost the state millions of dollars to implement .	the incidence of fraud is rare , they say , and it 's already a felony for someone to vote using someone else 's name .	democrats are n't sold on republicans ' insistence that motives behind the bill are nonpartisan .	black lawmakers referred to the efforts by civil rights leaders to protect voting rights after decades of jim crow-era restrictions to plead with republicans to oppose the bill they say will quell voter participation . "	this is part of an organized national strategy to find a way to disenfranchise voters to oppose you at the polls , there is no other purpose , " said rep. william wainwright , d-craven , who is black . "	this bill is partisan politics at its worst .	this is not restoring confidence in government .	you are increasing suspicion of government . "	the state has about 556,000 registered voters who do n't have identification issued by dmv , but it 's unclear how many of them have alternative forms of qualifying ids , according to researchers who work for the general assembly .	the bill is modeled on a 2006 law in georgia , which has been upheld by the courts .	republicans say georgia saw a higher increase in voter turnout among black voters during the 2008 election compared to black voters in north carolina . "	the requirements to prove who you are according to this bill are the same for all citizens , " said rep. ric killian , r-mecklenburg , another sponsor of the bill .	twelve states now have laws that require or request photo identification of voters , while 16 others require id without a photo , according to the national conference of state legislatures .

the first roads projects covered under a 3-year-old state law are proceeding ahead of schedule , nebraska officials said wednesday .	the work began after lawmakers passed the build nebraska act , which commits one-quarter of a cent out of the state 's 5.5-cent sales tax to roads projects .	gov. dave heineman and department of roads director randy peters said the six projects scheduled for fiscal 2014 and 2015 are moving forward .	nebraska 's 10-year plan calls for 17 projects throughout the state . "	these roads projects are critical to nebraska 's future , " heineman said at a news conference at the capitol . "	good roads are important for economic growth and public safety . "	the first projects include highway construction between blair and omaha , bypass projects in kearney and wahoo , and three projects around interstate 80 in omaha .	peters said the state is ahead of its schedule on this round of roadwork .	the so-called second phase cover roadwork around lincoln , plattsmouth , bellevue , hastings , schuyler , fremont , nebraska city and the heartland expressway to alliance .	a third group is expected to include a south beltway around lincoln , a highway widening project west of grand island , roadwork between murray and plattsmouth , and a new i-80 interchange in omaha .	intersections on u.s. highway 77 around west lincoln will be converted into highway interchanges .	the law by then-state sen. deb fischer of valentine was approved in 2011 in an effort to accelerate work on construction that was delayed for years .	nebraska in past years has focused on preserving its existing roads and bridges , which left little money for new construction .	the law will set aside about $ 70 million a year , departing from nebraska 's decades-old practice of using revenue from gas taxes and motor vehicle fees to pay for roads .	of the money set aside for roads , 85 percent will go toward state highway upgrades and 15 percent will get distributed to cities and counties .

about to be overrun by germans , a young black lieutenant called in an artillery barrage on his own position , knowing he 'd be killed .	it was the only way to hold off the enemy .	the sacrifice by 1st lt. john fox is one of many endured by the 100,000 african-american service members during world war ii and is now the focus of an exhibit at the national world war ii museum in new orleans .	titled " fighting for the right to fight : the african american experience in wwii , " the exhibit runs from july 4 through may 30 , 2016 .	it describes discrimination before and after the war as well as in the military during world war ii .	the exhibit also includes an original 8 1/2 - minute video about the famed tuskegee airmen ?	the first group of african-american pilots to serve in the u.s. military ?	and video interviews with 10 veterans , including rothacker smith of huntsville , alabama who served in the 366th infantry regiment .	a seventh-day adventist and conscientious objector to combat , smith ?	serving in the same segregated 92nd infantry division to which fox also belonged ?	was drafted and became a medic .	often smith was the only african-american on the bus back from town to camp stewart , georgia , on saturday nights .	he remembers being made to sit in the baggage compartment behind the back seats .	smith was stationed in southern italy , where his unit guarded airfields , one of many noncombat jobs to which black troops were relegated .	but the war 's heavy death toll eventually sent more african-american troops into combat .	smith was assigned to a machine-gun nest in sommocolonia , italy , where fox was a forward observer directing fire for one of the 366th 's artillery units .	by that time , ammunition was running so short in italy that it was rationed , said john h. morrow , a university of georgia history professor and co-chair of the national advisory committee that drew up plans for the exhibit .	smith said that when the sergeant in charge of the machine gun crew called on christmas day for a barrage on german artillery , he was told , " we ca n't fire until tomorrow morning because we used up our 16 rounds for today . "	the morning of dec. 26 , 1944 , a german mortar shell hit the window of the stone house where the machine-gunners and smith were holed up .	smith was hit in several places , including his right hip , elbow , upper back and cheek .	he used his teeth and left hand to bandage his sergeant , who was more severely injured .	later in the day , as the germans pressed their attack toward fox , he made the ultimate sacrifice : he called in artillery fire right on his own position .	smith knew , from their location , that the guns were american . "	but i did n't know the significance of it until 50 years later , " he said .	smith was captured and taken prisoner by the germans until his release on april 29 , 1945 .	unlike many pows , he said , he was able to keep all his clothes because they were bloodstained and full of holes .	he has donated his long-sleeved , blood-soaked undershirt to the museum .	after helping to defeat the tyranny of nazi germany and its allies , black soldiers returned home , expecting a more tolerant nation .	most were deeply disappointed . "	segregation was still the law of the land , and racism was alive and well , " the museum 's website says . "	for many african american veterans , that disappointment became determination to create change .	they fought against segregation and discrimination with the same sense of purpose that had defeated the axis . "	it is no coincidence , the exhibit points out , that many leading figures of the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s were veterans , including medgar evers , who became one of mississippi 's most active civil rights leaders and was buried with full military honors at arlington national cemetary after he was assassinated by a white supremacist in 1963 . .	in 1995 , smith returned to sommocolonia with his sons .	they saw a memory garden listing the names of italians killed on the day he was wounded and one american name : lt. john fox .	fox was among seven african americans awarded the medal of honor in 1997 for service during world war ii , after president bill clinton ordered an investigation of why blacks had not been receiving the medal .	five of those medals were loaned to the exhibit , curator eric rivet said . "	it 's the first time they 've been together since they were awarded in 1997 , " rivet said .
one day , he 's mingling with alligators and checking out cypress trees in south carolina .	another finds him roaming tejon ranch in california .	and on still another , he 'll watch volunteers mark birds at a hawk-banding station in veracruz , mexico .	but it 's his recent gulf of mexico trips - and an incredibly popular youtube video that followed - that he 's interested in talking about today , especially how how audubon has helped to restore regional wetlands , barrier islands and deltas . "	the first trip turned my stomach , " says yarnold , who officially took over as audubon president in september , and returned to the gulf coast soon thereafter . "	the second trip gave me hope . "	yarnold was working for the environmental defense fund when he visited the gulf coast for two days in june , but his findings would remain pertinent for the job he 'd start a few months later .	one of the nation 's top conservation agencies , audubon has a mission to conserve and restore natural ecosystems , wildlife and their habitats .	following that first trip , yarnold blogged on the huffington post about the oil spill that began april 20 . "	( up ) close , where every breath you take fills your mouth , nose , and lungs with the toxic mix of oil and industrial chemicals , " he wrote , " where the disturbing and unforgettable scenes of a precious and fragile ecosystem in crisis are just seared into your mind - all of it is just so bad , so repugnant , so wrong in the most profound way . "	yarnold knows something about storytelling ; he was a pulitzer prize-winning editor when he worked at the san jose mercury news .	but one chance moment reminded him that the power of video - and music - could reach his audience in other ways .	a version of " somewhere over the rainbow , " as performed by the cast of the hit fox show " glee , " enhances a montage of audubon 's stirring oil-spill footage .	yarnold was inspired to juxtapose the two online when his teenage daughter , nicole , played the song as the family viewed the footage in their living room . "	the song , a slow , sweet , ukulele and guitar-driven version , could n't have added a deeper sense of tragic irony , " yarnold wrote .	peter rice , a fox chairman , gave edf permission to use the song with the video .	with a boost from gossip site perezhilton.com , the video has been viewed more than 295,000 times since it was posted june 16 . "	now , for me , ( the song ) is a part of what kind of world we 're going to leave my kids , " says yarnold , who lives in new york 's lower hudson valley . "	it 's personal for me . "	in september , yarnold returned to the gulf coast with an audubon team to explore the spill 's impact on birds .	although bp installed a cap to stop the leak on july 15 , the cleanup is far from complete .	that , combined with fall migration , means new populations of birds are heading toward the region .	and where there are birds , he says , there 's particular ecosystem sensitivity . "	birds lead you to the richest veins of biodiversity in america , " he says .	yarnold says people in louisiana and mississippi have a lot more hope now than they did in june , and they 're helping with audubon 's cleanup initiatives . "	talking to people down there , once the well was capped ... people were unanimous in their support of rebuilding the wetlands , " he says . "	they understand how precious that habitat is and how central it is to their way of life . "
two tigers are in a new home at a northeastern indiana animal sanctuary after their ohio owner says she could n't meet that state 's new law setting stricter requirements for keeping them .	the tigers named delilah and sammie arrived sunday at the black pine animal sanctuary near albion ( al-bee ' - ahn ) after a trip from the tiger paw rescue center outside ashland , ohio .	tiger paw center owner denise flores tells wane-tv ( http://bit.ly/xchwde ) that she could n't afford to keep the cats she 's had for 17 years because of additional insurance and other costs .	a new ohio law took effect last month requiring exotic animal owners to have liability insurance and pass safety inspections .	that law was passed after a suicidal zanesville , ohio , man released dozens of exotic animals from his property last year .
missouri 's republican-led legislature enacted a new congressional redistricting plan wednesday , acting quickly to override a veto by democratic gov. jay nixon .	senators voted 28-6 to override nixon 's veto .	a few hours earlier , four house democrats joined the entire 105-member republican house caucus to provide the minimum two-thirds majority required to overcome nixon 's objections .	the house approved the override 109-44 .	missouri 's redistricting plan merges two democratic congressmen into the same st. louis district to help consolidate missouri 's nine current congressional districts into eight .	missouri lost a u.s. house seat after the 2010 census because the state 's 7 percent population growth failed to keep pace with the rest of the nation .	the new map also had to account for population shifts within the state , including an exodus from st. louis to its outer suburbs .	republicans leaders said the map 's new districts are compact and contiguous ?	two standards they had sought to achieve . "	we 're happy with the result , " said house speaker steven tilley , r-perryville . "	we think it 's a fair map .	we think it 's representative of the state . "	but democratic critics argued the map was partisan and raised concerns about congressional borders cutting through their home counties .	nixon renewed his objections wednesday to the new congressional map . "	i do not believe this map reflects a fair representation of the interests for all regions of our state , " he said . "	now that the map is finalized , we expect a robust electoral process in these significantly altered districts . "	although the house debate on whether to override nixon 's veto fell largely along partisan lines , regional issues played a greater role in the senate , where there was no debate before overriding nixon 's veto .	three kansas city-area senate democrats joined nearly all the republicans in overriding nixon 's veto .	sen. bill stouffer of napton , whose rural area will be folded into a kansas city district , was the lone republican to support nixon 's veto .	among the house democratic lawmakers to cross party lines and support the veto override was rep. jonas hughes , who had voted against the congressional redistricting map when it originally passed the house last week .	shedding tears during the override vote wednesday that he wiped away with a navy blue handkerchief , hughes said he feared the courts could end up drawing new congressional districts if the veto were not overridden .	he said people he spoke with in the democratic party at the federal level supported the redistricting map . "	it was a tough decision , " said hughes , d-kansas city . "	sometimes it hurts to stand up for what you think is right . "	house minority leader mike talboy , who praised nixon 's veto , said congressional redistricting should be handled by a nonpartisan commission in future years . "	there really needs to be some looking out for the citizens of this state and not just looking out for the political advantages that one may have , " said talboy , d-kansas city . "	we need take a hard long look at that so we do n't have the same thing happen in 10 years , regardless of who 's in charge . "	the legislative maneuvering on congressional redistricting started last week when lawmakers gave their map final approval .	nixon vetoed it this past saturday and urged lawmakers to come up with a new plan that better represents " all regions of the state " before the end of the legislative session may 13 .	instead the republican-led legislature overrode nixon 's veto .	under the congressional redistricting proposal , the city of st. louis is put entirely into the 1st congressional district now represented by democrat william lacy clay .	the city currently is split with the 3rd district represented by democrat russ carnahan .	carnahan 's district is divided among clay 's district ; the suburban st. louis district held by republican todd akin ; an overhauled district held by republican blaine luetkemeyer of central missouri ; and the southeastern missouri seat held by republican jo ann emerson .	jefferson county , near st. louis , is split into the districts of akin , emerson and luetkemeyer .	carnahan spokeswoman sara howard criticized the redistricting plan enacted wednesday . "	families and businesses across this state are facing the prospect of weaker representation and divided communities , all in the name of a partisan power-grab , " howard said in a statement .	in the kansas city-area , cleaver 's district would be extended farther east to pick up several rural counties while a swath of jackson county would be carved out and added to the district of republican sam graves , whose district would spread across the northern half of the state .	west-central missouri 's 4th district , represented by freshman republican vicky hartzler , would lose cole county , which is home to jefferson city , and instead gain boone county , where columbia is located .	southwest missouri , currently represented by freshman republican billy long , would see the least change , because its population grew faster than most regions of the state .
democrats controlling the house have approved a plan to cut $ 7 billion from president barack obama 's budget request for foreign aid and the operating budgets for cabinet agencies .	obama has already proposed an overall freeze in non-security agency accounts for the budget year that begins in october .	at issue is the one-third of the federal budget that congress passes each year through appropriations bills .	it 's only a little snip from the almost $ 1.2 trillion proposed by obama for such accounts and would come after generous increases approved over the last two democratic-dominated appropriations cycles .	the measure was approved instead of a more comprehensive budget blueprint that would have forced democrats to go on record in support of huge deficits .
the indiana department of correction mistakenly paroled a convicted sex offender who now faces charges in the sexual assault of a woman in a drugstore restroom two days after his prison release , an agency spokesman said .	robert kemp jr. , 31 , of ann arbor , mich. , was being held on $ 50,000 cash bond at the st. joseph county jail in south bend on wednesday , a day after prosecutors charged him with rape , criminal deviate conduct and attempted criminal deviate conduct .	the department of correction mistakenly transferred kemp from southern indiana 's wabash valley correctional facility to the custody of the south bend parole district on dec. 30 instead of holding him for wabash county , where he was wanted on a warrant , agency spokesman doug garrison told the south bend tribune . "	a mistake was made , " garrison said . "	it 's clear something went wrong . "	a statewide record system used by police showed kemp was wanted on an active warrant , also on a charge of criminal deviate conduct , but the correction department 's internal records showed the warrant had been dismissed , garrison said .	prison officials who prepared kemp for release saw both and assumed the department 's records were correct .	discharge officers " should have called wabash county to see if the warrant was still active , even though our records showed that it was n't .	they did n't do that , " garrison said .	prosecutors say that two days after this release kemp went to a walgreens store in south bend and waited in a bathroom stall until a female employee entered , then he assaulted her .	prosecutors , in a charging affidavit filed tuesday , said another person entered the restroom during the attack , prompting the victim to call for help .	kemp fled the restroom but was captured by bystanders who held him until police arrived .	kemp is scheduled to appear in court on jan. 18 .	a jailer said he did not know if he had an attorney .	garrison said the correction department hoped to avoid the mistake in the future by having staff make phone calls to clear up any discrepancies in records .	records show kemp was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2003 for criminal deviate conduct and to 2 ?	years in prison in 2009 for breaking and entering .

the tiny town of reynolds had big plans when gov. mitch daniels touted it in 2005 as the location of biotown usa , the state 's first project to make a community produce enough energy to become self-sufficient .	but progress has been slow in the five years since in the town about 25 miles north of lafayette .	a $ 2.7 million greenhouse featuring rotating wheels covered with algae serves as the wastewater treatment facility and is the most visible sign of progress toward the biotown goal .	but the excitement that surrounded daniels ' 2005 launch of the effort has died down as several other proposed projects dried up .	state officials insist they are still committed to the project and are working behind the scenes to help reynolds obtain grants .	brandon seitz , director of the indiana office of energy development , says the algaewheel plant could spur additional development . "	a lot of it hinged on getting that first thing happening , " seitz said . "	we 're certainly proud to see that happening now . "	the goal of biotown is to increase the town 's access to ethanol and other biofuels and transform animal waste into electricity and natural gas .	the wastewater facility began operating in january .	wastewater passes through filters and then flows through nine rotating wheels covered with algae .	the algae feed on nutrients in the wastewater , which passes through additional filters and a disinfection system before being discharged from the plant . "	as of this month , we 're getting excellent test results , " said mark brewes , chief financial officer of indianapolis-based algaewheel technologies llc , which built the system . "	it 's even better than expected . "	still , residents in the white county town of about 500 people say they expected more . "	i think it 's kind of died and shriveled up , " said gene dallinger .	reynolds town councilman sid holderly said the town is trying to find grants to defer the cost of the algaewheel project , which algaewheel technologies paid for .	but he said many groups are reluctant to fund experimental projects .	seitz said the state is helping the town apply for grants and remains active in the permitting process .

the candidates for illinois congressional seats heard all about it during visits with voters in august : disgust with washington .	dismay over accusations and negative advertising in illinois ' state races .	lack of interest in the nov. 4 election .	while the complaints transcend party allegiances and demographic boundaries , republicans are aiming to capitalize on the frustrations and predicted low voter turnout to take back a number of congressional districts across illinois and help the gop solidify its hold on the house just two years after losing most of the state 's competitive seats .	among the incumbents targeted as vulnerable are freshmen democrats brad schneider , who represents the suburbs north of chicago , bill enyart , who represents southern illinois , and cheri bustos , who represents a swath of northwestern and central illinois .	meanwhile , both sides are pouring money into a tough contest pitting one of the gop 's own freshman , rodney davis , against former madison county circuit court judge ann callis in the bow-tie shaped district that stretches from champaign to the st. louis suburbs .	two of the races are rematches from 2012 , when schneider defeated first-term gop rep. bob dold and bustos defeated first-term gop rep. bobby schilling .	the democratic victories two years ago were aided by turnout for president barack obama and a new congressional district map , drawn by democrats in springfield that heavily favors democrats .	they currently hold a 12-6 majority in the state 's congressional delegation , having reversed the republicans earlier 11-8 advantage .	illinois lost one seat after the 2010 census .	david yepsen , director of the paul simon public policy institute at southern illinois university , says the sour voter mood compounds the typical problems faced by the party in power during midterm elections .	to many , washington appears to be paralyzed by partisan conflicts while national and international crises have unfolded . "	some ( voters ) are just giving up on the political process , and i think that will help republicans , " he said . "	the party in power always has trouble in midterms , but this could be more pronounced . "	another possible factor is a democrat at the top of the ticket , gov. pat quinn .	quinn 's approval ratings are among the lowest of the nation 's governors and he has angered some traditional democratic allies , such as union members , for supporting reduced state worker benefits to deal with the state pension crisis . "	i think you 're going to see a lot of democrats just staying home , " yepsen said . "	i think that starts to hurt other democrats up and down the tickets . "	congressional candidates have encountered the general malaise as they make their campaign rounds .	congress " has lost sight of the average americans ' needs and wants and concerns , " said albert weidlich , an 84-year-old retiree after a candidate forum in decatur during congress ' annual august recess .	katie prill , a spokeswoman for the national republican congressional committee , said the gop 's illinois strategy has changed from defense to offense .	the nrcc has spent a half million dollars on television ads to support dold against schneider , and a total of $ 1.4 million to support mike bost , who is facing the democrat enyart , and davis in their races .	prill singled out the dold-schneider race as a " huge pickup opportunity " for republicans .	dold lost to schneider in the independent-leaning district by about one percentage point in 2012 .	the democratic congressional campaign committee has spent $ 800,000 on ads so far in the dold-schneider race , and about $ 3.5 million in the other two districts .	u.s. house minority leader nancy pelosi recently appeared in chicago to rally with callis and schneider , and push the democratic campaign themes of equal pay for women and raising the minimum wage .	dccc spokesman brandon lorenz rejected the idea of gop gains , saying voters will recognize that the gop " rewards the ultra-wealthy and the special interests . "	eighty-one year-old barbara norem was among the undecided voters who showed up at a decatur senior center to hear davis speak last month .	she said her top concerns were the future of medicare , social security and other government services that help her and her husband stay in their home as health care costs escalate .	however , " when you hear the news , you think all congress does is fight , " she said .

shares of supplement retailers vitamin shoppe inc. and gnc holdings inc. fell monday after regulators moved to block the marketing of an ingredient in some of the products they sell .	late friday , the food and drug administration said it sent warnings letters to 10 companies that make and distribute dietary supplements that contain an ingredient called dmaa , or dimethylamylamine .	the fda said dmaa can not be used as the active ingredient in a nutrition supplement because the manufacturers have not provided evidence that it is safe .	the agency said there have been reports of heart problems and even death in patients who have taken dmaa .	the fda said it has received 42 reports of side effects in patients who took supplements that contain dmaa .	they include heart and nervous system problems , psychiatric disorders , and death .	it said dmaa can narrow blood vessels , which can raise blood pressure and cause shortness of breath , tightness of the chest , and heart attack .	the agency said it is not clear if dmaa was responsible for the side effects in the reports .	dmaa is also called methylhexanamine , or geranium extract .	the fda said companies never provided information indicating the product is safe before they began selling it in nutritional supplements .	it said the companies have 15 days to respond .	deutsche bank analyst charles grom said gnc gets around 2 percent of its total revenue from dmaa product sales , estimating that it has sold about 440 million doses of products with dmaa since 2007 .	he said the issue is " relatively minor " and it is unlikely that gnc will lose all sales of dmaa products .	grom estimated that its annual profit could be cut by 9 to 14 cents per share if that happened .	in afternoon trading , vitamin shoppe stock lost $ 1.53 , or 3.1 percent , to $ 47.37 and gnc shares fell $ 1.79 .	or 4.4 percent , to $ 39.20 .

a former lawyer intrigued by the global demand for energy says he chose to invest $ 100,000 in oil giant chevron corp. back in 2004 , a smart stock bet that now would have doubled seven years later .	but perry christy has a big problem : he says chevron 's stock agent never deducted money from his bank account .	as a result , he has no records to show he actually owns a certain number of shares .	so christy , 69 , is suing chevron and mellon investor services and seeking an extraordinary remedy .	he wants a federal judge to declare that he should be credited with buying the stock at a june 2004 price , plus any additional shares that would have piled up by reinvesting dividends .	then he 'll pay $ 100,000 .	based on the terrific rise in san ramon , calif.-based chevron 's stock , it would be like winning the lottery ?	and then buying a ticket . "	there was some kind of mix-up on the day i placed the order , " christy insisted in an interview at his home in the detroit suburb of northville . "	whether mechanical or electronic , i do n't think we 'll ever know .	but it 's their screw-up .	when you deal with any large bureaucracy , people are focused on their own narrow niche . "	after more than a year in court , chevron and mellon smell a scam and want the case dismissed , even suggesting that christy 's story of a genuine yet botched investment simply is a lie . "	litigation can not be used as a form of risk-free investment strategy , " attorney nicholas gorga said in a filing .	there are ways to purchase stock without going through a traditional broker .	they include clicking online and making investments through company-sponsored plans that carry low fees or none at all .	chevron offers such a program through mellon .	there is no dispute that christy went online and created a chevron account in 2004 .	he has a document confirming it and another record that states , " your shares have been entered . "	but there 's also no dispute that no money ever changed hands .	christy said he instructed mellon to take $ 100,000 from his bank account .	although bank records show he had more than enough money to cover it , the transaction was never completed . "	it 's the weakest point i have " in the lawsuit , conceded christy , who has a master 's degree in business from the university of pennsylvania 's wharton school in addition to a degree from the university of michigan law school .	he said he noticed that his bank balance had n't changed much .	he said he contacted mellon about the investment but never got a proper reply about what had happened . "	they kept promising , ' we 'll get back to you . '	i was n't going to call them anymore .	it was n't that i had a mental lapse , " christy said . "	i got tired . "	he said email and letters were n't productive , either .	meanwhile , as oil prices have risen over the years , so has chevron 's stock .	if dividends were reinvested , christy claims he would own roughly 2,600 shares today worth approximately $ 260,000 .	lawyers for chevron and mellon said the case has no merit .	they said christy filed the lawsuit in 2010 as a last gasp as the statute of limitations neared .	they also have raised doubt about his credibility , noting that his law license was revoked in 1997 after christy was caught accepting clients while the license was suspended .	he said it 's irrelevant .	a judge will hear arguments on aug. 30 about whether to dismiss the case .	as he approaches 70 , christy said he did n't want to leave the mess to his family . "	if i die , " he said , " my heirs would have a hell of a time reconstructing what went on . "

when lorraine santalucia graduated from landstown high school in 2010 , her parents and grandparents broke the bad news .	they 'd support her any way they could but would n't be able to pay anything for her to go to college .	the virginia beach native went anyway , vowing to cobble together the money .	after being admitted to her " dream school " - hollins university in roanoke - she tapped every source she could think of to cover the cost : cash from the gi bill because her stepfather had been in the navy .	scholarships from the university itself .	even money she had saved up from high school baby-sitting .	by the end of her freshman year , though , the funds were running out , and she faced a choice : take out loans to stay at the $ 40,000-a-year private school she loved , or switch to a state college that would cost much less for a virginia resident .	she transferred to virginia commonwealth university , a move she described as " really crushing at the time . "	although the change lowered her costs , santalucia needed to find other ways to save .	she took a heavy load of 18 credits every semester .	she got used textbooks or borrowed them from professors and other students so she could scan them .	she signed up for a smaller meal plan and supplemented it by cooking at home .	but that was just one side of the equation .	bringing in more money was the other .	she worked part time as a hostess and social media manager for a mexican restaurant during the school year and made sure her summer internships paid .	and she began applying for scholarships .	lots of them . "	i remember struggling to figure out where the money was coming from , " she said . "	i remember the pressure on my parents .	i remember my mom and grandma asking , ' what if she does n't get that $ 1,000 scholarship she applied to ? '	i remember wondering if i would finish graduation . "	santalucia said that in addition to attending classes , doing homework and working part time , she spent more than 30 hours a week on scholarship applications .	she boned up on the organizations doling out the money to make sure her essays jibed with their missions .	she researched people honored with memorial scholarships and mentioned them in the applications along with what they stood for . "	it was really another full-time job , " she said .	but it got easier , she discovered .	first , a lot of the applications required the same sorts of answers , so she was rarely starting from scratch .	second , she began to realize that winning scholarships led to winning more because people seemed to think a students who 'd already won something was worthy of a hard look . "	there 's this domino effect , " she said .	in the end , she bagged more than $ 65,000 in scholarships and grants , and she graduated from vcu last year with a degree in mass communications and a post baccalaureate in nonprofit management .	debt free .	now , at age 23 , santalucia is making a career out of teaching others to do the same .	she founded a nonprofit while at vcu called scholarship sharing .	the woman who once used " scholarshipping " as a verb to describe how she would knock out 10 to 20 applications in one sitting hopes to make it easier for others to follow in her footsteps .	college students need santalucia 's skills now more than ever .	this year 's graduating class and their parents are saddled with the most debt in history - $ 70 billion , which is seven times more than in the early '90s , according to a recent wall street journal analysis .	more than 70 percent of students have outstanding loans when they get their diplomas , up from around 45 percent in 1993 , the newspaper found .	the average graduate is saddled with $ 35,000 in debt , 3-1/2 times more than 20 years ago .	santalucia 's message to students facing these realities : do n't be bashful or afraid of rejection .	you 're going to get rejected .	a lot .	but keep at it . "	there 's thousands of people applying , and you 're just another one of those numbers , " she said .	after santalucia transferred from hollins to vcu on the fly without taking out loans , fellow students who were impressed started asking for advice .	friends and family members wanted help for their kids .	so in the summer of 2012 , she started a facebook group to share what she 'd learned , and within a week more than 300 people had joined .	many thought she was affiliated with vcu because she knew more than any university employees they 'd talked to , santalucia said . "	that was when the light bulb went on , " she said , " it was a really shocking revelation the school did n't already have something like that . "	the facebook group turned into a student organization , which led to workshops , webinars and a website .	then she got the idea to model her effort after job , career and college fairs .	why not a scholarship fair ?	in 2013 , she brought 30 organizations together on the vcu campus to tell students about the money they were giving away and how to get it .	nearly 850 of them showed up , including those from other colleges and high-schoolers .	the next year , the numbers swelled to 60 organizations and 1,500 people .

"	giancarla rojas offers herself up as exhibit a .	the 21-year-old senior majoring in international economics at radford university near blacksburg took note after her mentor told her he 'd met santalucia .	he thought they 'd hit it off and suggested rojas reach out .	rojas pored over scholarship sharing 's website , took a webinar and eventually met santalucia in person .	on santalucia 's advice , rojas tweaked her applications and started winning more scholarships .	one from radford covered half of her $ 10,000-a-year tuition , but the rest was up to her , rojas said .	she said she has applied for more than 50 scholarships and received more than $ 35,000 .	last month , rojas , who said she was " very inspired by lorraine 's work to help other students , " joined scholarship sharing as its vice president .	she said she plans to graduate this year .	debt free .

terri lynn land was the first republican to express interest when michigan 's long-time democratic sen. carl levin announced his retirement .	six months later , despite pundits once predicting a potential wide-open primary , the former secretary of state remains the lone gop candidate after three congressmen and others declined to run .	she is looking more and more like republicans ' standard-bearer in their attempt to win a u.s. senate seat for just the second time in 40 years .	democrats have coalesced behind u.s. rep. gary peters .	an " anyone but land " faction has been concerned because of her poor debate performance during a short-lived look at a gubernatorial bid four years ago .	but the wealthy land 's ability to partially self-finance a political run that could cost tens of millions of dollars , her two statewide election victories , her gender and her lack of a legislative voting record make her appealing to others . "	we 're very excited about the fact that we 're uniting the party and bringing everyone together , " land told the associated press in a saturday interview at the 30th mackinac republican leadership conference , where 1,500 republicans gathered to hear from state and national leaders .	asked whether the party is fully unified behind her , even though lesser-known republican cardiologist rob steele could still jump into the primary in october , land said more republicans are realizing michigan will be crucial if the gop is to win control of the chamber in under 14 months .

"	i think that 's the thing that people understand .	it 's one of those opportunities with an open seat that you do n't get very often .	people realize that if we all work together as a team , we can do this . "	a recent poll showed a tight race between land and peters .	lansing pollster epic-mra found that of 600 likely voters surveyed by phone sept. 7-10 , 38 percent supported peters and 37 percent backed land .	it is still early , though , as 25 percent were undecided or refused to answer .	the national republican senatorial committee cites that poll , along with a decline in president barack obama 's job performance rating , as evidence that a seat levin has held since 1979 can turn red . "	they 're obviously very excited about the opportunity to have one candidate and focus on that so you can get yourself prepared for the general election and be out there talking about the national issues , " land said . "	they understand that getting out there early and building your team and raising the resources to win is important . "	democrats say it is clear republicans remain uninspired by land , pointing to a slow start and lack of endorsements .	land 's camp predicts most republican u.s. house members from michigan will endorse her soon .	though republicans enjoy complete control of state government , democrats sit in both senate seats and have fared well in federal elections in a state that has gone for democrats in six straight presidential races .	the extent to which the gop will spend to try to win the senate seat is unclear , and democrats say there is a reason that reps. mike rogers and dave camp ?	who were recruited to run ?	decided against it .	for now , it increasingly appears that land can focus on peters and not a primary opponent . "	we could do a lot worse , by far , " said paul mitchell , a retired businessman who has not yet backed land but whose super pac is airing anti-peters tv ads . "	she did a good job as secretary of state .	the question is there anybody else with better qualifications to step up ? "	former state gop chairman saul anuzis said land , a republican national committee member , is in great shape and he sees no challengers emerging . "	i think she 'd be a very strong candidate , " he said .	kevin heine , chief strategist for icaucus michigan , which vets to find conservative tea party-type candidates , credited land for reaching out and making her case with activists .

a man who wounded an anchorage police officer and killed himself as other officers closed in had a violent past and was a suspect in an armed robbery last week of a coffee stand , police said thursday .	kenneth robinson was sought in the shooting early wednesday of patrol officer jean mills , 45 , who was struck twice during a traffic stop in east anchorage .	police converged on a home in west anchorage hours later , and as officers contemplated how to make an arrest , robinson walked outside , pulled out a gun and shot himself , police chief mark mew said .

"	she 's turning away and takes , probably , the first round in the right upper arm , " mew said .	with her arm wounded , the right-handed officer could not return fire and was forced to retreat . "	as she turns to run , to retreat , she takes a second round through the hip area , " mew said .	robinson took off , driving at least two to three miles before abandoning the car in the parking lot of the whaley center , a public school , where officers found it several hours later .	police learned he had help leaving the area , said homicide lt. michelle bucher .	police traced the car to a rental company on fifth avenue .	robinson 's name was among several on the rental car agreement and a photocopy of his driver 's license was attached .	mew said there were no other suspects .

johnnie to 's priority this year is the mainland chinese market .	but the acclaimed hong kong director is trying to keep signature local movies in his pipeline by proxy : his frequent collaborator law wing-cheong is delivering a small psychological thriller that explores revenge and class tensions . "	punished , " which is scheduled to make its world premiere at the upcoming hong kong international film festival on april 4 , features veteran hong kong actor anthony wong as a ruthless property tycoon who intimidates villagers in order to confiscate their land ?	only to be humbled after his rebellious daughter is kidnapped and murdered .	his search for revenge brings him only greater mental anguish .	the hk$ 23 million dollar ( $ 3 million ) production lacks the stylish , dance-like action sequences that have won to and his production company milkyway image international renown , but director law ?	a regular assistant director and occasional actor for to ?	makes up for the deficit with a sophisticated exploration of human psychology .	law 's picture , on which to served as producer , can also be seen as a broader examination of rich-poor conflict in hong kong 's hyper-capitalistic society .	wong 's tycoon is awash with cash thanks to his brutal tactics and hong kong 's inflated property prices .	but he faces payback from the working class when a used car salesman plots his daughter 's kidnapping ?	and finds a willing coconspirator among wong 's staff .	the biting political commentary , the violent scenes and use of foul language are standard fare for hong kong cinema but are questionable for mainland china 's more prudish film censors . "	this is a high-risk project , " law told the associated press in an interview on wednesday . "	we are talking about revenge .	and there is no sense of justice in the movie : no one is arrested by police and put into jail .	whether this story meets the need of the mainland market is an unknown factor . "	taiwanese actor-singer richie jen , who plays wong 's bodyguard , told the ap it was n't clear if mainland audiences would see the movie . "	maybe they need to adjust their movies to pass censorship , " jen said .	so " punished " investor , hong kong studio media asia , has mainly set its sights on the local market in this southern port economy that reverted from british to chinese rule in 1997 .	despite the resumption of chinese sovereignty , hong kong has retained a western-style government and civil liberties like freedom of speech .	it 's an increasingly rare strategy as hong kong filmmakers rush to cash in on the rapidly expanding mainland market ?	also coveted by hollywood studios . "	punished " perhaps also offers director to a way to balance his commercial pressures and his artistic integrity .	the master himself finds himself increasingly pulled to the mainland .	he is currently shooting the second of two romances targeted at mainland viewers ?	but outsourcing projects with a more hong kong local flavor to his collaborators helps keep the milkyway image brand alive .	still , jen hopes the social themes in " punished " reach a broader audience beyond hong kong . "	when i started shooting this movie , i knew it was n't commercially oriented or entertainment-oriented .	but it touches your heart , " jen said .

colorado democrats facing recall elections for their support of gun control laws failed in separate attempts to block or slow their recall elections wednesday .	the secretary of state 's office ruled against senate president john morse of colorado springs , who wanted his recall effort invalidated because of a technical error by his opponents .	deputy secretary of state suzanne staiert also rejected a request by democratic sen. angela giron of pueblo to have her recall challenge shifted to a new venue because she said republican secretary of state scott gessler would n't fairly decide her case .	the twin decisions mean appeals and more legal wrangling over what could be the first state legislative recall elections in colorado history .	in the morse case , staiert rejected the democratic claim that recall petitions were invalid because they were improperly worded .	she said the petitions " substantially complied " with the law .	she said that morse 's opponents " made a good-faith effort to comply with the law and did not consciously attempt to mislead the electorate . "	in the giron case , the senator 's recall petitions were worded much the same , and she is making an identical challenge .	but first , a democratic lawyer asked for gessler 's deputy to recuse the office .	mark grueskin made the recusal request after seeing a march account in the pueblo chieftain of gessler telling a republican gathering about the recall process . "	this is an event and an act that calls into question the ability of the secretary to render a decision without the appearance of impropriety , " grueskin said .	staiert dismissed the concern , saying gessler did n't advocate for a lawmaker 's recall . "	there is no appearance of impropriety here , " staiert wrote .	giron and morse are being targeted for recalls because they both supported gun control measures .	gun-rights activists say democrats went too far curbing gun rights with two of the measures ?	one to restrict ammunition magazines and another to expand required background checks .	four democrats were initially targeted , but recall petitions only made it to completion against morse and giron .	gessler 's office has said the morse and giron petitions had enough valid signatures to force recall elections , possibly later this summer .	democratic gov. john hickenlooper would ultimately set the recall election dates , but not before legal challenges are exhausted .	if morse and giron face recall elections , they 'd be the first state lawmakers to go to a recall vote since colorado adopted the recall in 1912 .	grueskin , the lawyer making both recall challenges , has said he 'd appeal decisions to the denver district court .

as a pediatric oncologist , dr. peter anderson long ago noticed that , when children are diagnosed with cancer , parents often ask what foods or supplements will help during treatment .	that got him thinking .	and he realized it 's not so much about what to eat as it is about being able to eat .	it 's often difficult for cancer patients to eat because of mouth sores .	also called mucositis , this inflammation of the mucous membranes in the mouth and digestive tract is a common and painful side effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy .	and it 's a major reason why cancer patients do n't get all the nutrition they need .	anderson started working on the problem in the early '90s .	and this fall , the carolinas healthcare system physician announced his solution to the world at an international medical conference in toronto .	it 's not a drug or a food .	it 's a special mouthwash called healios .	developed by anderson with multiple collaborators , healios has been shown to minimize mouth sores and enable patients to eat enough to keep up their strength .	anderson 's interest in the subject goes back about 20 years , when he worked in a bone marrow transplant unit at the university of minnesota .	one day he noticed that 11 of 12 patients were on morphine drips because " they had really bad mouth sores . "	when he searched the medical literature to find out " what makes healing faster , " he learned that " critically ill patients did better if they had some glutamine . "	it 's an amino acid that is " the fuel for your intestines and the lining of your mouth , just like glucose is the fuel for your brain , " anderson said .	but the answer was n't as simple as buying glutamine in a health food store .	sprinkling glutamine on food would n't help if mouth sores made it hard for a child to chew or swallow .	so anderson consulted a university of minnesota pharmacist who helped him develop a sweetened glutamine liquid that was tested in three randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies .	and the results were good . "	there was strong evidence that glutamine in a good-tasting solution works , " anderson said . "	it reduced mouth sores . "	and that enabled patients to eat . "	if you can maintain your weight , usually you 'll tolerate the other side effects of chemotherapy better , " anderson said .	while he was at the mayo clinic for 10 years , anderson continued testing the product .	when one pharmacist worried the sweet liquid might cause cavities , they switched from sugar to nutrasweet .	it did n't work , but it led to an important discovery .	anderson said they learned that sugar helped get " 100 - to 1,000-fold more glutamine into cells " than nutrasweet . "	it took both the sugar and the glutamine to get the glutamine into the cells , " he said . "	i was a pediatrician trying to make it good tasting .	it was not science .	it was serendipity . "	later , while working at m.d. anderson cancer center in texas , anderson collaborated with labrada , a company that sells nutritional supplements , to improve the product and get it to market . "	we needed a good-tasting powder that could be easily stored and shipped , " anderson said .	instead of the " messy , sticky solution , " they came up with healios , a powder of glutamine and sugars that can be mixed with water .	it comes in orange or grape flavors . "	it tasted better than i thought it ever would , " said anderson , who moved to charlotte in 2013 .	he joined levine children 's hospital as director of pediatric hematology , oncology and blood and marrow transplant .	healios has been on the market since september 2013 , according to alex rodriguez , a representative with the healios oncology nutrition , the start-up company in texas .	rodriguez said the " all-natural product " is sold directly to patients as well as pharmacies for $ 49.99 for a 30-serving supply .	it can be purchased online at www.healiosproducts.com .	anderson , who holds the patent , does not benefit financially .	the company is just getting started , and rodriguez is preparing paperwork to begin selling healios in other countries .	patients who use it are advised to " swish and swallow " healios twice a day .	to prevent mouth sores , they can start using it even before they begin treatment .	valerie miniex , a dietitian with louisiana oncology associates in lafayette , la. , said she has 20 patients with head and neck cancer who are using healios , and she 's been " amazed at the results . "	she learned about it three months ago from a patient who had used it at m.d. anderson .	separately , miniex said she had been reading about the effects of glutamine to hasten healing .	miniex said dry mouth and mouth sores are " major issues " for patients with head and neck cancer . "	we 're always treating the symptoms .	here was an opportunity to prevent them . "	only one of her patients has been unable to tolerate healios , because of acid reflux , miniex said . "	that 's huge to get that kind of response .	... it 's such a problem that we 're all just excited to have something that is working . "	this fall , anderson shared the healios story at the international society of paediatric oncology congress , before 1,900 doctors from 92 countries .	his poster presentation was prepared by katrina ashlin , a davidson college senior who interned with anderson last summer at carolinas medical center .	ashlin , a biology major who plans to become a dentist , developed educational materials about healios and distributed them to nurses and nutritionists , those most likely to work with patients on treating mouth sores .	ashlin 's work was paid for by joedance film festival , an event that raises money for research into rare pediatric cancers .	the festival was created in memory of joe restaino , who was 20 when he died in 2010 of osteosarcoma .	over five years , it has raised more than $ 55,000 for levine children 's , where restaino received some of his care .	his mother , diane restaino of charlotte , said her family is proud to have sponsored anderson 's project because mouth sores were a " very painful side effect for joe . " "	he could n't eat .	it was painful for him to even drink water , " she said . "	this would have taken so much pain away from joe through all of that chemotherapy . "	because joe died before anderson arrived in charlotte , restaino had n't tried healios mouthwash when she met with the doctor at cmc .	he mixed up a dose and offered it to restaino , who took a swallow and declared : " it 's really good . " "	this is a huge deal to know that you can go right downstairs to get this , " diane restaino said . "	it seems like a small thing , but it will make a huge difference to a lot of cancer patients .

rep. rob hutton and sen. chris kapenga say the measure represents a step toward curtailing government expansion .	state agencies ' spending has risen from $ 65.8 billion in the 2009-11 budget to $ 73.3 billion in the current 2015-17 budget . "	by having agencies provide us with this information we can have important discussions about what programs are and are n't working and where spending can be reduced , " hutton , r-brookfield , said in a news release announcing the bill .	under current state law , agencies must submit their budget requests for the next two years by sept. 15 of every even-numbered year .	the requests assume the agencies will receive the same amount of funding they got in the last biennium and build from there .	the governor uses those requests as a starting point for building the next budget .	under the bill , each agency would have to attach a plan to their budget request for reducing their spending by 5 percent in the upcoming biennium .	they also would have to include a plan for maintaining their current budget levels for the two-year period . "	for too long we have worked on the assumption that all spending from prior budgets is justified , " kapenga , r-delafied , told the senate 's government operations committee during a public hearing on the bill thursday .	the bill 's prospects look unclear .	no groups have registered in support or opposition , according to state government accountability board records .	spokeswomen for assembly speaker robin vos and senate majority leader scott fitzgerald did n't immediately respond to an email inquiring about the bill 's chances .	a spokeswoman for gov. scott walker also did n't immediately respond to an email message .
voters in north carolina overwhelmingly supported mitt romney in his bid for the republican presidential nomination and the chance to face president barack obama in november .	north carolina has become a key battleground state , and it is considered integral by both campaigns to securing the general election .	in addition to north carolina , romney won victories tuesday night in indiana and west virginia pushing him closer to the 1,144 delegates he needs to clinch the gop nomination .	the three victories will hand him 100 or so delegates of the 288 he still needs .	both obama , who was uncontested in the democratic primary , and romney , recently spoke in north carolina .
i try to raise my animals and i sell them to the marketplace , " says mcintosh , 53 , a retired professional fisherman .	the way some of those transactions are conducted is sparking national debate among hunters , conservationists , politicians and animal rights groups .	mcintosh operates a 189-acre hunting preserve , enclosed by 8-foot fences , where clients pay to shoot , mostly with a bow , deer and sometimes elk and buffalo .	mcintosh , who also has 8,000 acres for free-range hunting , does n't guarantee that his customers will kill an animal .	he also tests his deer 's health and wo n't allow bottle-fed animals to be hunted .	his business , midwest woodlots , benefits the state and helps the local economy , he says .	opponents of the practice , including the humane society of the united states , call it captive or canned hunting .	twenty-six states have full or partial bans on captive hunting of mammals .	the humane society says the usa has about 1,000 captive - hunting facilities , half in texas . "	captive hunting for both native wildlife and exotic wildlife should be illegal , " says the humane society 's casey pheiffer .	a recent undercover investigation found captive-hunting facilities that sedated animals and lured them to waiting shooters , she says .	mcintosh says bad facilities unfairly taint the industry . "	if something is being done that should n't be done , let 's resolve it , " he says , " but let 's not put people out of business . "	efforts to limit the practice u.s. rep. steve cohen , d-tenn. , this year introduced a bill that would bar the interstate transport of exotic animals for the purpose of killing them for entertainment or trophies .	the bill , which has n't been scheduled for a hearing , also would ban the interstate movement of equipment for computer-assisted remote hunting , in which online users aim and fire a mechanized weapon .	killing animals in a preserve or via the internet " is just the last thing that a true hunter would do , " cohen says .	pheiffer says there 's been " a major push " to expand the industry this year , though most bills were not enacted .	opponents cite fairness issue opponents say hunting preserves violate the " fair chase " concept . "	did the animal have a fair chance to escape ? "	asks keith balfourd of the boone and crocket club , a conservation group founded by theodore roosevelt . "	they 're not hunts , they 're shoots , " he says , " and the club denounces that activity . "	ryan giannini , owner of highland hideaway hunting in riverside , iowa , stocks his 1,500-acre preserve with pheasant and chukar , another game bird .	he releases birds into areas that are to be hunted and makes sure his land is hospitable , he says , but " once they 're released , after a couple days they might be somewhere else . "	his preserve , says giannini , 29 , is an ideal place for youngsters to learn to hunt and for adults to work with hunting dogs .	critics , he says , " think it 's like shooting fish in a barrel , " so he often invites them to hunt in his preserve . "	we do get the handful that are totally against it for their own reasons and beliefs , " he says . "	sometimes you just ca n't change their mind .

( ap ) ?	shareholders who say the former massey energy co. lied about its safety record to inflate stock prices before the upper big branch mine disaster have narrowed their settlement demands enough to enter mediation with the company .	u.s. district judge irene berger signed an order last week that puts the long-running civil lawsuit on hold for six months to let those negotiations proceed with outside help .	in court filings , both parties say they 've been working to settle the case since december 2011 with face-to-face meetings and written communications including " a series of demands and counter-offers that have narrowed the extent of the disagreement . "	the joint motion says the talks have reached a point where mediation would help .	investors led by the massachusetts pension reserves investment say massey repeatedly lied about its record , artificially inflating stock prices between 2008 and 2010 .	they say shareholders had no knowledge of the long history of violations until after the southern west virginia mine exploded in april 2010 , killing 29 men .	massey was later bought by virginia-based alpha natural resources .	the shareholders ' case has been on hold because the judge is shielding evidence the plaintiffs want to use from an ongoing criminal investigation .	four investigations found the blast was sparked by worn and broken equipment , fueled by accumulations of methane gas and coal dust , and allowed to spread because of clogged and broken water sprayers .	investigators also found " systematic , intentional and aggressive efforts " to hide problems and throw off inspectors , including the falsification of safety records .	former superintendent gary may and security chief hughie elbert stover are behind bars for their actions at the mine .	a former president of another massey subsidiary , meanwhile , is awaiting sentencing for conspiracy .	david hughart is cooperating with prosecutors and is set to appear aug. 1 in beckley .

phil moon , one of 24 military veterans to make the second installment of utah honor flight , had ridden in a bus for an hour and a half , posed for myriad photos and received hearty congratulations from many of utah 's most prominent politicians tuesday morning .	now it was time for the veteran of world war ii and the korean war to get a closer look at the national world war ii memorial .	but first , a familiar voice called his name . "	hi grandpa ! "	it was marine maj. dane salm , who had taken time off from his duty at the pentagon to visit his grandfather .	moon said they had n't seen each other in several years .	and moon did n't know salm was coming . "	here he comes , out of the blue , " moon recalled a few hours after the meeting , still emotional about the encounter . "	what a great surprise that was .	i had tears in my eyes . "	it was just one of many heartwarming , soul-lifting experiences felt by utah 's wwii veterans , including 10 who left from southern utah , during a three-day visit to washington d.c. , which culminated with a welcome-back ceremony at vernon worthen park that included a speech from st. george mayor jon pike .	on the trip , the veterans were treated to two banquet dinners , toured the wwii memorial , the air force memorial , the iwo jima memorial and several of the other memorials that dot the mall in washington .	they were accompanied by guardians ?	usually family members ?	and four volunteers from the utah honor flight 's all-volunteer staff .	the primary goal of the trip was to see the memorials .	what many of them did n't anticipate was the outpouring of gratitude they would receive .	when the southern utah contingent arrived at the baltimore airport , they were greeted with hearty applause as hundreds of people lined the walkways , including about 30 members of the air force .	some of the men received more than just cheers .	one woman , moved by the occasion , said , " i have to kiss one of these handsome men " ?	and planted one on moon .	vernon hughes , a st. george resident who was part of the army air forces , boarded the bus looking and feeling years younger .	as he headed to his seat , he grabbed a stranger and with a gleam in his eye and said , " was that a reception or what ? "	the tours of the memorials evoked memories from the men 's wartime service of seven decades ago .	upon arriving to the iwo jima memorial , cornelius de jong of salt lake city said , " i was there when that happened . "	a navy machinist 's mate , de jong helped marines to shore during the second wave of the iwo jima assault .	he recalled the first of the two iwo jima flag-raisings on feb. 23 , 1945 , and how wonderful it was to see the colors ?	even as 8 - and 16-inch guns from nearby ships roared behind him . "	we were cheering and celebrating , " de jong said , " then later we were all bawling . "	family was the theme for alvin macauley , who served in the army air forces .	in addition to his daughter who served as guardian , four other family members were in attendance .	karen macauley , alvin 's granddaughter , drove up from north carolina . "	it 's been absolutely wonderful , " she said . "	he lives in st. george , so we do n't really get to see him a lot .	but he really enjoyed himself .	he was happy the whole time .	in the aftermath , the veterans were beaming , some of the men holding court with much younger flight attendants while they retraced their steps back home and shared memories of wartime service .	ed baumgarten , a st. george resident who parachuted into his first combat in the philippines in 1945 , marveled at how well the uhf volunteers had everything planned .	the trip came at no cost to the veterans .	the accompanying guardians must pay their way , which can range from $ 800 to $ 900 .	the whole project is funded by donations , and uhf is an all-volunteer staff .	yet to baumgarten it was a professional effort , from the accommodations to the meals and pageantry . "	i ca n't imagine anything that could be done better , " he said .	for most veterans , the gratitude they received was the best part .	rock-star treatment was the norm .	gratitude was extended in so many different ways , so many times , it left the veterans awestruck .	moon said one of the things that " really got to me " was the kids coming up and saying , " thank you for your service . "	st. george resident jay " ed " williams told everyone he encountered what a wonderful time he had . "	those crowds , they really made the day , " he said . "	it made me really emotional . "	then he paused . "	this was the greatest event of my life , " he said .
more people cast primary ballots in north carolina during this year 's early-voting period compared to the last midterm election in 2010 , as the race to choose a republican challenger to sen. kay hagan invigorated some voters .	but the level of interest in voting saturday in the final day of early voting depended on the region .	in lee county , roughly 200 voters trickled in to the county 's two voting sites before saturday 's deadline .	voters interviewed said they came to the polls out of civic duty and convenience before tuesday 's primary day .	a big local race is the 2nd congressional district democratic primary featuring american idol veteran clay aiken and former state commerce secretary keith crisco .	but moore county democrat kenny washington says there 's still a lot of apathy among citizens .
ford and general motors ' new union contracts may qualify them for higher credit ratings .	moody 's investors service said wednesday it 's reviewing ratings for ford .	the dearborn , michigan , automaker reached a deal on tuesday with the united auto workers for a new four-year contract .	the automaker 's ratings under review include " ba2 " for corporate family and probability of default , and " ba3 " for senior unsecured debt , both of which are so-called junk status .	they also include " baa3 " for secured bank debt , the lowest level of investment grade .	an upgrade would return ford more squarely to investment-grade status , which the automaker has said is one of its top goals .	about $ 55 billion of debt would be affected .	moody 's is already reviewing detroit-based gm 's ratings after its workers ratified a similar contract last week .
april miller and karen roberts will return to the rowan county courthouse on friday for the fifth time since june to ask for a marriage license .	only this time , clerk kim davis will not be there to stop them .	instead , she will be in jail , ordered there by a federal judge who found her in contempt for refusing to follow his order that she issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples .	u.s. district judge david bunning offered to release davis if she promised not to interfere with her employees issuing licenses , but she refused .	she told the judge her mother-in-law pleaded with her to go to church from her deathbed four years ago .	she did , converting to christianity and the belief that gay marriage is a sin .	after sending davis to jail , bunning threatened each of her six employees with the same fate if they refused to comply with his order .	five of the six deputy clerks told bunning they would issue the licenses .	the sixth clerk , kim davis ' son , was the holdout .	at one point , bunning looked at davis ' son nathan and warned him not to interfere with his fellow employees on friday .	the judge said he did not want " any shenanigans , " like the staff closing the office for computer upgrades as they did briefly last week . "	that would show a level of disrespect for the court 's order , " bunning said .	he added : " i 'm hoping that cooler heads will prevail . "	nathan davis sat stoically as the judge questioned the clerks , some of whom were reluctant . "	i do n't really want to , but i will comply with the law , " deputy clerk melissa thompson said , weeping while she stood before the packed courtroom . "	i 'm a preacher 's daughter and this is the hardest thing i 've ever had to do in my life . " "	i do n't hate anybody , " she added . "	none of us do . "	bunning indicated kim davis would remain in jail at least a week , saying he would revisit his decision after the deputy clerks have had time to comply with his order .	davis said she hopes the legislature will change kentucky laws to find some way for her to keep her job while following her conscience .	but democratic gov. steve beshear again refused to call a special session of the legislature on thursday .	state lawmakers will not meet until january .	davis , an apostolic christian , wept during her testimony in federal court thursday . "	god 's moral law conflicts with my job duties , " davis told the judge before she was taken away by a u.s. marshal . "	you ca n't be separated from something that 's in your heart and in your soul . "	davis stood and thanked bunning after he ordered her to jail , pausing briefly to search the crowded courtroom for familiar faces before she was led away .	miller said she was stunned with the judge 's order .	she said she and roberts will get a license , " show that piece of paper off for a minute or two , " then go home and try to resume a quiet life together , without court appearances and reporters calling at all hours . "	we look forward to ( friday ) as a couple , " she said . "	it will be a very important day in our lives . "
warm weather usually brings with it the familiar roar of exhaust pipes as motorcycle riders awaken their slumbering bikes for another season .	this past winter never really saw a stop to the riding season , though , and it 's been cause for both joy and caution .	higher than normal temperatures with only a bit of snow gave bikers the ability to cruise central illinois streets in relative comfort even in january .	greg wade of the goldwing road runners association 's decatur chapter has been in the saddle for years .	he said the unseasonably warm weather even had him out a few times during the winter . "	there were a few ( in our club ) that rode , and i even rode a couple of times , " wade said .	for mechanics , it 's been the cause of a busy season , but also a much more profitable one .	ryan guhlstorf , service manager at world of powersports in decatur , said major repairs have been up at a much higher rate than they normally are .	in just about any other year , many bikers would just be beginning to prepare their motorcycles for the approaching season .	more riding has meant more wear on equipment , if the number of service calls is any indication . "	we 've never changed tires in january before , " guhlstorf said . "	right out of the gate on march 1 , we had a boom .	we 've already begun our summer schedule . "	in addition to persistently fine weather , he said escalating gas prices are encouraging people to ride their more fuel-efficient bikes more often .	there 's reason to remain cautious as well , wade said .	at the best of times , car drivers do n't always see motorcycles or account for disparities in the way they negotiate traffic , and in winter they might not even be looking to begin with , he said . "	they figure most motorcycles in the winter are not out , and you 've got to be extra careful to make sure people see you because they wo n't be looking for you as much as they would in the spring or summer , " wade said .	terry redman , manager of the state-run motorcycle rider safety training courses offered by the illinois department of transportation , said the good riding weather has unfortunately meant accidents that would n't normally happen this time of year . "	we 've noticed that we 've had fatalities in january and february , and that 's unusual .	on a good day , people have invested a lot of money in these motorcycles and they want to ride . "	there have been a number of motorcycle fatalities in macon county and surrounding counties over the past few weeks .	redman said other motorists and bikers themselves both need to take additional precautions , especially now when the riding season would normally be just getting into gear . "	the public is not used to seeing a motorcycle in the winter , " redman said . "	everybody just needs to be aware to start seeing motorcycles and the motorcyclists themselves need to wear gear that makes them more visible , " he said .
total enrollment hit an all-time high of 81,132 , according to preliminary figures released thursday by the college board .	students flocked to mississippi 's universities during the recession , trying to improve their job credentials .	the number of students fell as the economy improved , but has resumed rising .	overall university enrollment is 17 percent higher than it was 10 years , ago , which higher education commissioner glenn boyce said was a positive for the state , where the number of college-educated residents has long trailed national averages . "	they are preparing to be the next generation of teachers , doctors , nurses , engineers , entrepreneurs and leaders of our state , " boyce said in a statement . "	we also know that they will earn more and make a significant difference in moving mississippi 's economy forward . "	jackson state university , mississippi state university , mississippi valley state university and the university of mississippi all saw enrollment rise more than 3 percent .	those increases outweighed decreases at alcorn state university , delta state university , mississippi university for women and the university of southern mississippi .	though there are exceptions , the split displays a widening divide between mississippi 's four larger institutions , which have larger graduate programs and regional or national ambitions , and the four smaller universities , which are recruiting students furiously just to keep enrollment from shrinking .	the number of students at ole miss , including the university of mississippi medical center in jackson , has climbed for 21 straight years , rising close to 24,000 .	the university said it has the largest freshman class ever , and that average act scores and high school grade point averages also hit records . "	we are attracting more students who are well-prepared to enter college , " acting provost noel wilkin said in a statement . "	at the same time , we are investing in programs to help students to be successful . "	msu , which had seen enrollment fall since 2011 , rebounded to a new high , also aided by its largest-ever freshman class .	jsu provost james renick said he was " delighted " by a third year of growth there .	jsu enrolled so many students that the university scrambled to house them even after buying an apartment complex and renting a second hotel near campus .	students were also up for the second year in a row at mississippi valley , where a yearslong decline had raised questions about the itta bena university 's viability .	but usm saw the number of students fall for the fourth straight year , the exception among the larger schools .	usm officials emphasize that they want to attract and retain high-performing students , and say they welcomed the largest-ever freshman class , with record test scores and high school grades .	however , a large number of seniors graduated last spring and falling enrollment brought budget cuts and a handful of layoffs earlier this year . "	the university remains committed to ensuring quality across the board , " president rodney bennett said in a statement .

the university of minnesota plans to boost its recruiting and retention efforts to counter declining black enrollment in graduate and professional programs .	blacks now make up 2.7 percent of all master 's and ph.d. students at the university , down from 2.9 percent four years ago .	the drop has been even steeper in professional programs such as law and medicine ?	from 3 percent to 2.3 percent .	university officials tell minnesota public radio ( http://bit.ly/1lxizyj ) they 're at a loss to explain why fewer blacks are studying for advanced degrees there .	sally kohlstedt , dean of graduate education , says there 's been a drop in african-americans across the country , but minnesota seems to be dropping even more rapidly .	the university 's share of black graduate students is about a quarter of that usually found around the country .

in a sign of the strength of edwards ' ties to the unions , the democrat 's first speech since winning the weekend runoff election was monday at the louisiana federation of teachers convention in lake charles . "	i know the power and the promise of a public school education when it 's done right and when you 've got a good partner in the governor 's office .	well , let me tell you something , come jan. 11 you 're going to have a good partner in the governor 's office , " edwards told the group , according to a video of the speech provided by his spokeswoman .	his wife a public school teacher , edwards is a long-time critic of the voucher program that provides taxpayer-financed tuition to private schools .	as a state lawmaker , he has unsuccessfully sought to place more restrictions on the expansion of charter schools , which are run with broad autonomy from state and local education officials .	during his campaign against republican u.s. sen. david vitter , however , edwards said he would n't seek to shutter louisiana 's voucher program or its widespread use of charter schools to educate students .	but he said the voucher program should only be for students in failing public schools .	he also wants to prohibit the board of elementary and secondary education , or bese , from starting new charter schools in higher-performing districts that have denied the charter school application .	those positions have put him at odds with the louisiana association of business and industry , which endorsed vitter , and other " school choice " groups that have sought to broaden options available to students from families who ca n't afford private schools .	brigitte nieland , who works on education issues for the association , said she was concerned that edwards ' backing from the unions will drive some of his policy decisions and could undermine accountability and school choice programs . "	clearly he owes the unions a lot , " nieland said .	but she added : " he 'll be governing the entire state .	he 's a smarter man than to come in and try to annihilate everything overnight . "	regardless of edwards ' relationship with the unions , the new governor likely would have difficulty unraveling past education policy decisions if he decided to try .	edwards will be working a majority-gop legislature that has favored the voucher program , charter schools and other initiatives opposed by traditional public school groups .	plus , seven of the eight bese contenders that won this election cycle supported greater educational choice for children and were backed by the louisiana association of business and industry .	edwards only has three appointees to the 11-member education board . "	we take gov.-elect edwards at his word when he had his supporters tell voters that an edwards administration wo n't undermine parental choice , " ann duplessis , president of the pro-voucher louisiana federation for children , said in a statement .	the first dust-up may be over the future of superintendent of education john white .	bese selects the superintendent , but governors have had a heavy hand in those choices .	white is regularly at odds with the education unions .	edwards wants a new education chief . "	i believe we have many experienced classroom educators with the proper credentials in louisiana , and i believe there are a number of them who would be better choices for the state going forward in terms of being state superintendent of education , " edwards said sunday . "	i 'm going to work with the bese board , and we 're going to see how this plays out . "
the written account of the oct. 22 meeting released thursday shows the bank 's governing council remains worried about persistent low inflation and the impact on europe of the economic slowdown in china and other emerging markets .	the account says that " the view was put forward " that a case for more action could be made " already at the current meeting . "	that view was countered by arguments that domestic demand was strengthening and that more analysis was needed .	the bank held off any new action , but the fact that a discussion was held at all suggests a higher level of concern about the economy among at least some members of the bank 's governing council .	ecb president mario draghi has said the bank could increase its stimulus at the dec. 3 meeting .	it could increase the size of its 1.1 trillion euro ( $ 1.2 trillion ) program of bond purchases , which pumps newly printed money into the economy .	he indicated the bank could also cut the interest rate for deposits kept by private-sector bankks at the ecb 's super-safe deposit facility , which is already negative 0.2 percent .	the rate-setting council expressed concern that the current low rate of inflation - an annual 0.1 percent in october - could continue for longer than expected .	the bank 's goal is just under 2 percent and it has had to cut its forecasts for future inflation several times .	low inflation is a sign of a weak economy , and also makes it harder for economically struggling members of the eurozone such as bailed-out greece to become more competitive by reducing their business costs relative to other members of the currency union .	the current stimulus program based on bond purchases had run for eight of its planned 19 months , but " had so far not been able to deliver a noticeable impact on its final target , i.e. moving inflation decisively to a higher path , " the account said .	the ecb has also slashed interest rates , moving its main benchmark to only 0.05 percent annually , a record low .	low rates stimulate the economy by lowering costs for businesses to borrow , invest and expand .
a federal judge on monday ordered hawaii 's government to restore lifesaving health benefits to low-income legal migrants from micronesia , the marshall islands and palau , a ruling that will cost taxpayers millions .	u.s. district judge j. michael seabright issued a preliminary injunction requiring that more than 7,500 pacific islanders receive health coverage equal to plans provided to medicaid recipients .	the cash-strapped state had tried to save about $ 8 million annually by offering fewer benefits under a free plan called basic health hawaii that went into effect july 1 , but seabright 's ruling ends that effort .	micronesia , the marshall islands and palau are beneficiaries of the compact of free association , a 1986 pact with the united states granting it the right to use defense sites in exchange for financial assistance and migration rights after it used the pacific islands for nuclear weapons testing from 1946 to 1958 . "	plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction because they would be left without adequate medical coverage , which will force them to pay for treatment on their own or completely forego the treatment , " seabright wrote in his order .	the lawsuit claiming basic health hawaii unlawfully discriminates against the migrants would likely be successful , seabright wrote .	migrants ' health coverage was limited to 10 days of inpatient hospital care each year , 12 annual outpatient visits and a maximum of four medication prescriptions per month under basic health hawaii .	those constraints fell short of the care needed by many cancer and kidney disease patients , seabright wrote .	chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatments are unavailable in the pacific nations , and dialysis machines are rare . "	the decision by the federal court ... will have a significant impact on the state 's resources , " said democratic gov. neil abercrombie , who took office last week . "	the responsibility for providing the funds mandated by the compact of free association act lies with the white house and the congress .

a measure offsetting parents ' cost of private school tuition and homeschool expenses is moving to the house floor .	the house ways and means committee approved the bill 16-8 tuesday .	the measure sponsored by committee chairman brian white is projected to reduce state revenues by $ 37 million in 2012-13 .	white says his measure represents a home-grown version of a long-divisive issue that 's been fueled by out-of-state money .	his bill would allow parents to take a $ 4,000 tax deduction per child for tuition paid and $ 2,000 for homeschool expenses .	it would allow people to claim tax credits for donating to nonprofits giving scholarships to poor and disabled students .	the grants could total 75 percent of tuition .	republicans refused an attempt requiring benefiting private schools from using the same standardized tests as public .
katharina fabricius plunged from a dive boat into the pacific ocean of tomorrow .	a bleak portrait emerged : instead of tiered jungles of branching , leafy corals , fabricius saw mud , stubby spires and squat boulder corals .	snails and clams were mostly gone , as were worms , colorful sea squirts and ornate feather stars .	instead of a brilliant coral reef like the one living a few hundred yards away , what the australian institute of marine sciences ecologist found resembled a slimy lake bottom .	the cause : carbon dioxide .	in this volcanic region , pure co2 escapes naturally through cracks in the ocean floor , altering the water 's chemistry the same way rising co2 from cars and power plants is changing the marine world .	as a result , this isolated bay offers a chilling view of the future of the seas under ocean acidification .	as the burning of coal , oil and natural gas belches carbon dioxide into the air , a quarter of it gets absorbed by the seas , changing ocean chemistry faster than at any time in human history .	to understand how that will alter the seas , the seattle times crisscrossed the pacific ocean from papua new guinea to alaska , interviewed nearly 150 experts and people most likely to be affected , and reviewed most of the peer-reviewed studies .	the times found that ocean acidification is helping push the seas toward a great unraveling that threatens to scramble marine life on a scale almost too big to fathom ?	and far faster than first expected .	already , it has killed billions of oysters along the washington coast and at nearby hatcheries .	it 's helped destroy mussels on some northwest shores .	it is a suspect in the softening of clam shells and in the death of some baby scallops .	it already is dissolving tiny plankton , called pteropods , in antarctica that are eaten by many ocean creatures ?	and that was n't expected for 25 years .	the problem : when carbon dioxide mixes with water , it takes on a corrosive power that erodes some animals ' shells or skeletons .	it also robs the water of ingredients animals use to grow shells in the first place .	new science shows ocean acidification also can bedevil fish and the animals that eat them , from sharks to whales and seabirds .	shifting sea chemistry can cripple the reefs where fish live , rewire fish brains and attack what fish eat .	those changes pose risks for food supplies , from the fillets used in mcdonald 's fish sandwiches to the crab legs sold at seafood markets .	both are brought to the world by a northwest fishing industry that nets half the nation 's catch .	sea-chemistry changes are coming as the oceans also warm , and that 's expected to frequently amplify the impacts .	this transformation ?	once not expected until the end of the century ?	will be well under way , particularly along the west coast , before today 's preschoolers reach middle age . "	i used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct , " said james barry , of the monterey bay aquarium research institute in california . "	but this change we 're seeing is happening so fast it 's almost instantaneous .	i think it might be so important that we see large levels , high rates of extinction . "	globally , the world can arrest much of the damage by bringing down co2 emissions soon .	but the longer it takes , the more permanent these changes become . "	there 's a train wreck coming and we are in a position to slow that down and make it not so bad , " said stephen palumbi , a professor of evolutionary and marine biology at stanford university . "	but if we do n't start now , the wreck will be enormous . "	the country is n't doing much about it .	combined nationwide spending on acidification research for eight federal agencies , including grants to university scientists by the national science foundation , totals about $ 30 million a year ?	less than the annual budget for the coastal washington city of hoquiam , population 10,000 .	the federal government has spent more some years just studying sea lions in alaska .	species ' reaction to high co2 can vary dramatically .	acidification can kill baby abalone and some crabs , deform squid and weaken brittle stars while making it tough for corals to grow .	it tends to increase sea grasses , which can be good , and boost the toxicity of red tides , which is not .	it makes many creatures less resilient to heavy metal pollution .	roughly a quarter of organisms studied by researchers in laboratories actually do better in high co2 .	another quarter seem unaffected .	but entire marine systems are built around the remaining half of susceptible plants and animals . "	yes , there will be winners and losers , but the winners will mostly be the weeds , " said ken caldeira , a climate expert at stanford 's carnegie institution for science , who helped popularize the term ocean acidification .	many species , from sea urchins to abalone , do show some capacity to adapt to high co2 .	but they may not have time . "	it 's almost like an arms race , " said gretchen hofmann , a marine biologist at the university of california , santa barbara . "	we can see that the potential for rapid evolution is there .	the question is , will the changes be so rapid and extreme that it will outstrip what they 're capable of ? "	already , the oceans have grown 30 percent more acidic since the dawn of the industrial revolution ?	15 percent since the 1990s .	by the end of this century , scientists predict , seas may be 150 percent more acidic than they were in the 18th century .	in fact , the current shift has come so quickly that scientists five years ago saw chemical changes off the u.s. west coast that had n't been expected for half a century .	meanwhile , the arctic and antarctic are shifting even more rapidly because deep , cold seas absorb more co2 .	the west coast has seen consequences sooner because strong winds draw its co2-rich water to the surface where vulnerable shellfish live .	sea chemistry in the northwest already is so bad during some windy periods that it kills young oysters in washington 's willapa bay .	in less than 40 years , scientists predict , half the west coast 's surface waters will be that corrosive every day .	these chemical changes threaten to reduce the variety of life in the sea .	in six trips to papua new guinea , fabricius was surprised to see sea cucumbers and urchins living near the carbon-dioxide vents , but shrimp and crab were almost nonexistent .	she saw fewer hard corals than on healthy reefs nearby , and only 8 percent as many soft corals .	reefs were less intricate , offering fewer places for animals to hide .	sea grasses flourished but were less diverse .	there was twice as much fleshy algae .	corals , she said " are suffering , and they are incredibly important . "	and study after study shows the same thing ?	the more reefs collapse and fleshy algae spreads , the more fish simply disappear .	that loss comes at a price .	one-sixth of animal protein consumed by humans comes from marine fish ?	in some cultures nearly all of it .	fish also account for three-quarters of the money made from ocean catches .	yet reefs are just one way shifting ocean chemistry can harm fish .	in 2007 , american biologist danielle dixson , then a graduate student at australia 's james cook university , was studying the important ways clownfish use their noses to navigate the ocean .	then she bumped into james cook professor philip munday .	munday had been trying to see if carbon dioxide hurt fish .	the pair decided , on a whim , to see if co2 altered how fish use their noses .	their findings were a shock .	exposed to high co2 , the fish lost their ability to distinguish among odors .	since clownfish use smell to stay safe , the scientists then exposed baby fish in high-co2 water to bigger fish that eat young clownfish .	normal clownfish always avoided the danger .	the exposed fish lost all fear .	they swam straight at predators .	over the next few years , scientists learned co2 changed many reef fishes ' senses and behaviors : their sight , hearing , the propensity to turn left or right .	most important , that caused them to die two to five times more often .	last year , researchers figured out why .	elevated co2 disrupts brain signaling in a manner common among many fish .	the clownfish story , in other words , was no longer just about clownfish .	so scientists have been testing the most important fish in america : pollock .	fishermen in alaska catch roughly 3 ?	billion pounds of pollock a year in the north pacific .	it gets carved into fish sticks , sold overseas as imitation crab or packed in blocks .	seafood companies reel in $ 1 billion a year from that catch .	after tracking clownfish research , government scientists in oregon exposed young pollock to high co2 and introduced the scent of what they eat .	the fish struggled to recognize their food . "	in some of the very early work it looks like pollock may show some of the same kinds of deficits that are seen in coral-reef fishes , " said noaa biologist thomas hurst .	it 's too soon to say how that might affect pollock fishing .	some tropical fish raised in high-co2 water gave birth to young that adjusted to their new environment .	pollock might respond the same way .	but the fish also might not . "	we do n't yet know whether it 's going to be a really severe impact or a modest impact , " hurst said .	but " if the fish is less able to recognize the scent of its prey and then therefore locate food when it 's foraging out in the wild , obviously that 's going to have negative impacts for growth and then survival in the long run . "	and brain damage is not even the biggest threat to commercial fish .	all over the ocean , usually too small to see , flutter beautiful , nearly see-through creatures called pteropods , also known as sea butterflies .	scientists have known for years that plummeting ocean ph later this century would begin to burn through their shells .	but they were alarmed late in 2012 when researchers announced that pteropods in antarctica were dissolving already in waters less corrosive than those often found off washington and oregon .	that matters because birds , fish and mammals , from pollock to whales , feast on this abundant ocean snack .	pteropods make up half the diet of baby pink salmon and get eaten by other fish , such as herring , that then get swallowed by larger animals .	and so little ocean monitoring is done of creatures at the bottom of the marine food chain , there 's no telling yet if other plankton species are experiencing changes , too .	so , to understand the future of the marine food web , government computer modelers have been studying how sea-chemistry changes could reverberate through the ocean .	their initial results , looking at just the u.s. west coast , are disturbing . "	right now , for acidification in particular , " said isaac kaplan , a noaa researcher in seattle , " the risks look pretty substantial . "	kaplan 's early work projects potentially significant declines in sharks , skates and rays , some types of flounder , rockfish and sole , and pacific whiting , also known as hake , the most frequently caught commercial fish off the coast of washington , oregon and california . "	some species will go up , some species will go down , " said phil levin , ecosystems leader for noaa 's northwest fisheries science center in seattle . "	on balance , it looks to us like most of the commercially caught fish species will go down . "	such changes could hit the west coast economy hard .	but in other parts of the world , the stakes are even higher .	on a warm papua new guinea night , a quarter-mile from the carbon-dioxide vents , edwin morioga and ridley guma sat in the dark in a canoe and prepped spears .	villagers here know increasing storms and rising seas someday will force them to move their sago tree huts to higher ground .	but with a quarter of a million people spread across 600 islands , the threat to food may be more significant .	fishermen here collect sweetlips and sea perch .	they gather shrimp and crustaceans .	and at night they dodge tiger sharks and saltwater crocodiles to spear small fish from beneath bountiful corals .	globally , the sea provides the primary source of animal protein for a billion people .	many , like morioga and guma , have few alternatives .	the pair slipped into the water and floated face down , flashlights trained on the reef .	amid the coral away from the carbon-dioxide vents , marine life is still plentiful .	in an instant , morioga saw a flash .	he took a breath and dived , stabbing a rabbitfish ?	his first catch of the night from what remains one of the world 's healthiest reefs .	at least for now .	to view the entire ocean acidification series , go to www.seattletimes.com/seachange

working to close next year 's budget gap without layoffs , the union representing state employees on tuesday released a report that its members say contains more than $ 10 billion in savings or revenue options that the north carolina governor and lawmakers should consider first .	the report by the state employees association of north carolina recommends allowing four-day workweeks , consolidating state health services and ending corporate incentives and special tax breaks to the motorsports and film industries .	democratic gov. beverly perdue is expected to release her budget thursday .	perdue and republican legislative leaders have said layoffs are likely in the next budget year as negotiators try to close a projected budget gap of between $ 2 billion and $ 3 billion .	perdue also has said her government consolidation would create redundant state positions . "	let 's all come to the table but do n't make public employees bear the entire burden on the state budget , " seanc executive director dana cope said during a news conference with state employees at his side holding placards promoting the " take pride in carolina " report . "	let 's share sacrifice and make sure companies pay their fair share . "	the group , a local of the service employees international union , says cutting the work force is a short-term solution that results in reducing critical services for north carolina 's citizens .	the bulk of the savings outlined in the report relate to hospitals and health care .	the report says $ 4.5 billion could be saved by requiring nonprofit hospitals and health care systems to give up a portion of their capital reserves to alleviate the projected gap .	that 's because the union says the hospitals accumulate large reserves through an indirect tax subsidy .	yet north carolina hospital association spokesman don dalton calls the argument a mistake , saying hospitals lost $ 1.2 billion treating medicaid patients and the uninsured last year . "	hospitals earn their tax exemptions every day , " dalton said in an e-mail , adding that taxing capital reserves " would have a negative impact on regular operations , despite seanc 's contention . "	the report said the state could save nearly $ 1.5 billion through health care changes , primarily by consolidating what it calls four health care systems in the state ?	for prisoners , state employees and teachers , medicaid patients and high-risk citizens that ca n't afford regular insurance .	in addition , extending a pair of temporary taxes set to expire this year would create another $ 1.3 billion in revenue , according to the report .	republicans have been adamant about letting them expire , although senate leader phil berger , r-rockingham , told reporters earlier tuesday that " if there are suggestions that are out from state employees or from anyone , we are interested in hearing what they are . "	other report recommendations include : ?	creating a four-day , 10-hour work week , at a savings of $ 600 million . ?	abolishing the golden leaf foundation , which receives half of north carolina 's share of the national tobacco settlement , at a savings of $ 570 million . ?	increasing the cigarette tax by $ 1 per pack , generating $ 454 million . ?	requiring multistate corporations to file tax returns that give a more complete picture of their north carolina activities so they are taxed according to their business in the state , generating $ 375 million . ?	eliminating corporate tax " loopholes " for certain industries , such as motorsports or the film industry , at a savings of more than $ 31 million . ?	require department of transportation mowing contractors to pay for road signs they damage , saving $ 10 million .
johnson faces a tough re-election challenge from longtime former sen. russ feingold , a democrat .	feingold was more aggressive in his criticism of trump , issuing a statement monday night on facebook and then again going after the billionaire real estate mogul in a fundraising email tuesday .

"	johnson has not endorsed anyone for president , and reisinger said he has not changed his position that he will support whoever is chosen as the republican nominee .	criticism of trump has come from the left and the right , inside the united states and abroad .	legal experts have widely panned trump 's proposal , which he first made monday night , as both unconstitutional and unworkable .	trump 's rival republican presidential candidates , along with house speaker paul ryan and other leaders in the gop , described trump 's remarks as out of line , un-american and dangerous .	trump stood by his comments tuesday , saying , " i am doing what is right . "	he argued that banning muslim immigrants and visitors is warranted after attacks by muslim extremists in paris and last week 's shooting in san bernardino , california .	in making his case , trump cited a poll done by the center for security policy , a foreign policy think tank that 's faced intense criticism as islamophobic .	the center 's leader , frank gaffney , has written that he believes president barack obama was not born in the u.s. and may be a muslim .	obama was born in hawaii and is a christian .	gaffney is also a top proponent of the claim that there is a global conspiracy by muslim leaders and institutions to overthrow the u.s. government and replace the constitution with islamic religious law .	johnson has appeared on gaffney 's radio show , including in september where gaffney said he " greatly admired " johnson .

georgians would be voting on two key senate primaries tuesday in a race with national implications , as republicans seek to take control of the u.s. senate for the last two years of president barack obama 's term .	in the republican race , three congressmen ?	reps. paul broun of athens , phil gingrey of marietta and jack kingston of savannah ?	are facing off against former dollar general ceo david perdue and former secretary of state karen handel .	a july 22 runoff was likely given the crowded field of well-known and well-funded candidates and state rules that require a candidate to receive 50 percent plus one vote to advance to the general election .	meanwhile , democrat michelle nunn has dominated in fundraising and was expected to win her primary against three opponents .	the republican primary fight has been closely watched nationally , with republicans needing just six seats to claim a majority in the senate .	nunn is considered a formidable opponent and republicans can ill afford to lose the seat , which opened when republican sen. saxby chambliss announced plans to retire .	although the state has voted reliably republican in recent years , democrats see an opening with changing demographics in the state ?	a growing minority population and residents moving in from out of state .	kingston , a longtime congressman , dominated in fundraising throughout the gop race and drew support from dozens of state and local officials .	of the three congressmen , kingston was considered the strongest to secure a spot in a runoff and received the backing of the u.s. chamber of commerce , which spent nearly $ 1 million in tv and online ads promoting him .	perdue , a cousin of former gov. sonny perdue , saw his standing in the polls rise in the weeks leading up the election due in part to his early and effective tv ads depicting his four opponents as crying babies who have had their chance as elected officials to fix the nation 's problems .	perdue , who made millions working at dollar general , contributed more than $ 2.1 million of his own money to the race , which helped pay for those early ads that also championed him as the outsider in the race .	handel also sought to claim the outsider mantle , running against the three congressmen with a message that they had spent a combined 42 years in washington .	throughout the race , handel trailed in fundraising but benefited from being the only candidate to have run statewide before and won .	she built momentum in the final month with the help of a comment by perdue and endorsements from former alaska gov. sarah palin , arizona gov. jan brewer , conservative talk radio host erick erickson and former gop presidential candidate rick santorum .	perdue 's comment dismissing handel 's lack of a college degree fired up her supporters but did n't appear to hurt him in the polls .	kingston 's early tv ads focused on his frugal nature , possibly to counter any attacks for his time spent on the house appropriations committee .	in later debates , handel , gingrey and kingston attacked perdue over his business record and comments he made suggesting that spending cuts alone could n't fix the nation 's fiscal problems .	his opponents argued that meant he would support tax increases , which perdue dismissed as a " deceitful " attack and pointed to a pledge he had signed not to raise taxes .	gingrey focused his campaign on the metro atlanta area and his pledge to repeal the federal health care law in his first term " or go home , " while broun sought to line up tea party support with his plan of evaluating legislation by whether it 's right/moral , constitutional , necessary and affordable .	the other republicans in the race were patent lawyer art gardner and network engineer derrick grayson .	neither had raised much money and trailed in the polls .	on the democratic side , former state lawmaker steen miles , psychiatrist branko radulovacki and rotc instructor todd anthony robinson were also on the ballot .

citigroup inc. and a syracuse developer say they 've settled a dispute that stalled the expansion of the carousel center mall into destiny usa .	at issue was a decision by citigroup global markets realty in 2009 to withhold about half of a $ 155 million loan package they 'd agreed to give destiny usa holdings for the 1.3 million square foot addition to the mall .	the developer sued the bank , which claimed the project was over budget and failing to attract tenants .	they say the deal announced friday will provide a fund to pay contractors who worked on the expansion , but released no other terms of the agreement .	destiny usa says in a joint statement that it intends to pursue completion of the project despite what it called a " challenging financial climate .

cleveland 's kids on the block puppets may be absent from local schools this year after the group lost its funding .	the troupe consists of about 80 life-sized puppets that raise children 's awareness of disabilities and other social concerns with their performances .	director jessica warren said there is pressure on children to perform academically , but it 's also important to keep them safe and healthy and make sure they have good morals .	kids on the block has been in cleveland since 1985 , touching the lives of 100,000 school children in the bradley and polk counties .	former first lady barbara bush even appeared with them once .	the cleveland troupe performs at no cost anytime teachers or guidance counselors request help .	if it does n't receive the $ 30,000 it needs to keep going , it might be taken over by the chattanooga troupe , which charges a fee for its performances .

many angus cattle ranchers are not pleased that oklahoma state university professor dave lalman is questioning the yield and breeding vigor of their herds . "	the big picture is that ?	and this is politically shaky ground ?	but the cattle industry in recent years has chosen to pass on crossbreeding and has heavily used the angus breed , " lalman said . "	and there are many positives to that . "	my concern is that what little data is available shows that the commercial cow-calf producer on average has not improved in productivity over the past 10-20 years , " he said . "	they have not increased weaning weight ; they have not increased pregnancy rate . "	lalman recently was in the spotlight at the alltech international symposium on the future of agriculture in lexington , ky. , where he presented an overview of beef cattle changes in the u.s. over a century and asked whether cattle ranchers are as efficient as they could be .	since the 1960s , the cattle industry has largely set aside an openness to explore crossbreeding , he said , and ranchers need to reconsider that decision .	he held up angus cattle as an example because the breed is so popular for u.s. beef .	texas and oklahoma are the two fastest-growing states in terms of angus registration . "	i 've received much feedback from angus ranchers , yes , " he said . "	and they 're not entirely happy .	but that 's ok .	it 's a conversation we need to have . "	don abernathy , a director at large for the oklahoma angus association , disagreed with lalman .	abernathy runs a ranch in altus . "	our angus breed has such a large genetic base that crossbreeding is not needed , " he said . "	there are more cattle registered angus per year than all other breeds put together .	there 's no reason to cross . "	right now i would tell someone to buy angus heifers and breed them pure because you 'll have more carcass and when you get your paycheck , it 'll be obvious they pay more money . "	abernathy said a friend recently bred one of his longhorns to an angus .	the calves of solid color brought 15 cents per pound more , he said .	it 's only a single example , but it suggests that ranchers should consider crossing their breeds with angus for better attributes . "	the breed is so large that i can go to canada and pick up a registered angus for breeding , " abernathy said . "	what 's the point ?	hybrid vigor .	some will say that 's impossible within the same breed , but it is .	it 's like me going to england to get me a wife ?	the hybrid vigor will still be there and the kids would be two or three inches taller than we are . "	lalman said a good breeding program requires commitment , a long-term perspective and a deeper understanding of genetics .	studies show that if a purebred female is crossed with enough difference in the gene pool , the first generation will show an increased weaned calf weight of about 25 percent in offspring over a lifetime , he said . "	it is complicated , and you 've got to present both sides of the story , " he said . "	the industry went through a pretty long period where they sort of overdid that and we ended up with all kinds of variation because people did n't use a planned crossbreeding program .	they 'd just jump on a fad and then switch breeds again a few years later .	and before long they did n't have consistent product . "	the primary drawback is a commitment to multiple breeding pastures ; the average size of a cattle operation in oklahoma is 32 cows , lalman said .	simpler operations cost less .	the big advantages of increased productivity and longevity outweigh those issues in the long run , however . "	the industry could benefit from careful crossbreeding ?	that 's the bottom line , " he said .
beneath the slogan " obama , do n't deport my mama , " dozens of migrant families deported from the u.s. despite having children born there rallied outside the u.s. embassy before president barack obama 's arrival thursday , demanding passage of a u.s. immigration law they say is vital to keeping families together .	vladimir mejia franco , 12 , held a hand-lettered sign that said " obama , stop deportations . "	the american citizen born in st. louis was 4 when his parents were deported in 2005 .	the family later split up after his father legally returned to the united states and started another family there .	vladimir lives in mexico with his mother , veronica mejia franco , 32 , formerly a housekeeper at a st. louis hotel who says she has a hard time finding work in the western mexican state of michoacan .	echoing the march 's slogan , mejia franco said " that 's exactly what happened to us . " "	he says that when he grows up he wants to go back , but he does n't know english or anything , " mejia franco said of her son . "	he wants to go now , to learn english , but he does n't want to leave me behind . "	similarly , immigration advocates in the u.s. have been angered by record numbers of deportations under obama , which they say is splitting up families .	a group of eight u.s. senators ?	four democrats and four republicans ?	have crafted an immigration bill that obama says meets his basic criteria of making the border more secure , targeting employers who hire people who are in the u.s. illegally , providing an opportunity for them to become citizens and improving legal immigration .	at a news conference later on with mexican president enrique pena nieto , obama said he was " optimistic about us getting this done because it 's the right thing to do . "

the gulf of mexico oil spill risked turning into a trans-atlantic diplomatic rift thursday after u.s. threats to have bp fork out billions more for the disaster caused a precipitous slide in the blue-chip 's stock , hurting retirement savings for millions of britons .	british lawmakers are even pushing prime minister david cameron to get president barack obama to tone down his stinging criticism of the oil company , complaining that the hostile rhetoric will have severe implications for pensioners with nest eggs in the company .	the share slide has since april almost halved bp 's market value to 69 billion pounds ( $ 101 billion ) , costing it the spot as britain 's biggest company ?	and some worry it could become a takeover target for upstart firms in asia .	bp said there was no reason for the stock drop , stressing its strong finances .	because of the rising hysteria , cameron is expected to discuss the issue with obama on a routine scheduled telephone call over the weekend .	british lawmakers want cameron to stress the blue chip company 's critical role in the national economy ?	some 18 million britons hold shares in the company in one form or another , many through their pension funds . "	i would like to see a bit of cool heads rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling , " said london mayor boris johnson . "	when you consider the huge exposure of british pension funds to bp it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great british company is being continually beaten up on the airwaves . "	cameron and his foreign secretary william hague , who are both out of the country on business trips , took a conciliatory stance .	in afghanistan , cameron said he understood " the u.s. government 's frustration because it is a catastrophe for the environment . "	in germany , hague said he had n't detected any anti-british rhetoric : " the important thing here is dealing with the problem ... that 's more important than any rhetoric that any of us may have indulged in . "	bp shares fell in london after the white house suggested that bp should pay unemployment benefits to thousands of oil workers laid off during a moratorium on deep-sea drilling triggered by the spill .	the u.s. justice department added that it was planning to take action when asked at a congressional hearing if an injuction was being considered against bp 's plans to pay investors a dividend , worth some $ 10 billion annually , this year . "	you attack the dividend and you are attacking millions of british pensioners , " said tom watson , a member of the opposition labour party who planned to officially table a motion in the house of commons supporting bp .	bp shareholders receive a dividend payment every quarter .	it has held steady at 14 cents per share , worth a total of around $ 10 billion , since july 2008 .	bp is due to announce details of its second quarter payment with its earnings report on july 27 , but it can make changes before then .	there are also worries that obama , who earlier this week suggested he would fire bp ceo tony hayward if he could , will tap into u.s. anger as oil-coated pelicans and turtles continue to wash up on devastated beaches and impose longer term sanctions that would prevent bp from bidding for new contracts in the united states , where it is the biggest oil operator .	but markets were also beginning to heed warnings from analysts who said wednesday 's 15.8 percent sell-off of bp shares in new york was an overreaction ?	the company has lost around half its market value since the spill began with an april 20 explosion at the deepwater horizon rig that killed 11 people .	in london , the stock recovered some ground after dropping as much as 11 percent at the open to a 13-year low .	it closed down 6.7 percent at 365.5 pence ( $ 5.35 ) .	in new york , the stock opened 9.8 percent higher at $ 32.05 , clawing back some of the losses from a 15.8 percent rout on wednesday .	bp said thursday that it was capturing more oil in a containment system as it reported that costs so far had risen to almost $ 1.5 billion ?	a hefty amount but still manageable given the company turned a $ 16 billion profit last year .	hayward has consistently declined to speculate on the final bill , but in an attempt to calm investors on thursday , the company pointed to its supportive additional cash flow from other projects , its strong debt to equity ratio and its proven reserves .	it had more than 18 million barrels of proven reserves and 63 billion barrels of resources at the end of 2009 . "	we do n't believe bp has a funding issue , but given the overwhelmingly hostile nature of the u.s. government the company may decide to suspend payments until the wells are capped and the clean-up sufficiently advanced to convince the u.s. that it can afford all the costs as well as pay dividends , " said evolution securities analyst richard griffith . "	unilateral action against bp over its u.s. operations , be it unreasonable or illegal , hangs over bp . "	robert talbut , the chief investment officer at royal london asset management , a shareholder in bp , said " there is a lot of very irrational and short-term selling going on . "	but he added that talk of a potential sale of assets or takeover bid ?	petrochina ltd. has been suggested by some as a potential suitor ?	was not surprising . "	i can understand exactly why someone else would want to buy the bp assets because i think they are grossly undervalued at the moment , " he said . "	as a shareholder , it 's not something i would welcome . "
the federal trial in lexington of three kentuckians accused of bilking investors out of millions in an oil - and gas-drilling scam is entering its final stages .	closing arguments are scheduled tuesday in u.s. district court in the trial of gary milby of campbellsville and bryan coffman and his wife , megan , of lexington .	the three have been on trial since april 19 .	prosecutors say investors were scammed out of some $ 33 million and the defendants spent the money on cars , jewelry , yachts , lavish birthday parties and retirement accounts .	defense lawyers denied the allegations .	steve romines , attorney for bryan coffman , said most investors knew investing in oil and gas wells is risky and they used the losses as tax deductions .

do n't get him wrong ?	michael rosenbaum is grateful for his seven years playing the villain lex luthor on wb 's " smallville , " and for his scores of other acting roles in television , movies and plays over the last 15 years . "	but being an actor is really kind of like being a pawn , " rosenbaum said .	at some point , the former newburgh resident decided he wanted something more . "	i thought ' would n't it be nice to write your own stuff , the say your own lines , get your own stuff produced , and hire your own friend ? ' "	at 39 , rosenbaum is doing all that , back where it all began , with " old days , " a feature film he wrote , will act in and will direct in newburgh and evansville over the coming month .	after several weeks of preparation , the movie 's 22-day shoot is set to begin sunday , rosenbaum said .	he will play the lead role in this story about an actor who returns from los angeles to his small , midwestern town for a 15-year high school reunion .	there , after spending time with old friends and an old high school flame , played by television and film actress morena baccarin , " he slowly starts to fall in love with this town he ran away from so many years before , " says rosenbaum .	the project brings rosenbaum back to where he fell in love with acting and found his calling .	the new york native moved to newburgh when he was 8 or 9 , he said , and then took theater classes all through his years at castle high school .	he did n't audition for a school play , however , until he was a senior , and then only under pressure from his drama teacher .	when he got the role of vince fontaine , " the crazy deejay , " he was terrified .	after the director coaxed him out from hiding behind the props , " i finally got the nerve to be seen on stage , " he said .	rosenbaum remembers hearing laughs from the audience after his lines , but the real payoff came the next day , as he walked down a hallway at castle high school . "	one of the popular kids said , ' hey , you were really funny in that play , ' " he said . "	i ca n't tell you how that changed my life . "	up until that point , he did n't think anyone noticed him .	for one thing , at 16 , " i was the shortest kid in my high school , " he said . "	i lied on my driver 's license and said i was 5 ' 1 " and 100 pounds , but i was really 4 feet 11 inches " and weighed 97 pounds . "	an 18-month growth spurt brought 30 pounds and elevated him to " 6 feet on the dot , " he said , but he had never felt as accepted at his high school as he did at that moment in the hall . "	i was n't accepted as me , but i was accepted as a character i was playing , " he said . "	i thought , this is the first thing in my life that i think is working .	i 'm going to do more . "	rosenbaum took to the stage in play after play at western kentucky university , where he graduated with a degree in theater and communications in 1994 .	he moved immediately to new york , working as a telemarketer , sharing a one-bedroom apartment with three others , performing in off-off-broadway plays and auditioning for stage , tv and film work .	rosenbaum 's screen career launched with a role in director clint eastwood 's " midnight in the garden of good and evil , " released in 1997 , and a role on tom arnold 's " the tom show " that same year .	since then , rosenbaum has racked up scores of credits .	his films include " urban legend , " '' sweet november , " '' poolhall junkies , " '' kicking it old skool " and " bringing down the house . "	in addition to his seven seasons on " smallville , " he 's played in and done voices for more than a dozen tv series , with recurring roles in " breaking in , " '' justice league , " '' jackie chan adventures , " '' the tom show , " '' zoe " and others .	he began writing scripts six or seven years ago , after actress carrie fisher encouraged him to turn his stories into a series .	rosenbaum wrote several scripts that producers liked , all the way through development , only to wind up unproduced . "	you sell the script , you make a little money , and your idea gets stuck on a shelf somewhere and collects dust , " he said . "	this is no fun . "	he decided to make " old days " after another feature project collapsed because some backers dropped out at the last minute . "	that 's when i finally said " i 'm doing it myself .	i 'm not going to rely on a studio or a network to make my dreams come true . " "	old days , " is a rewrite of " paradise , ind. , " an earlier script inspired by his own memories of growing up in southwestern indiana , he said .	he did find a producer and outside financing , but his own rose & bomb productions , a company his younger brother , eric , works with him in , is part of the team .	by shooting the movie in southwestern indiana , shooting high-quality digital tape that can be later transferred to film , rosenbaum expects to spend less than $ 1 million for a feature film that would cost $ 25 million to $ 35 million to make in los angeles , he said .	baccarin and the other los angeles actors he 's hired for the movie are all working for minimum scale , and he 'll use lots of local actors and extras .	newburgh 's castle high school and knob hill restaurant have invited him to film there , as has evansville 's washington square mall and several friends , who 've volunteered their homes and even a pet pig for the filming .	the city of evansville has fast-tracked licenses and discounted some fees , and the vanderburgh county sheriff 's office is working with the company to secure roads and locations .	and evansville mayor lloyd winnecke has agreed to help find a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft for aerial shots of evansville and newburgh along the ohio river .	with help like that , " the production values are going to be enormous , for the budget , " he said rosenbaum does n't know when the movie will be finished .	it typically takes a year between filming and release , he noted , " and this is my first feature film . "	he expects to have to shoot retakes and use some " editing magic " to get the movie where he wants it .	he knows what will happen when " old days " is complete , however . "	we 're coming back , and we 're going to premiere here , " he said . "	i 'm coming back to show the movie . "
hurricane sandy grounded thousands of flights in the u.s. northeast monday and upended travel plans across the globe , stranding passengers from hong kong to europe .	the massive storm threatens to bring a near halt to air travel for at least two days in a key region for both domestic and international flights .	major carriers such as american airlines , united and delta cancelled all flights into and out of three area airports in new york , the nation 's busiest airspace .	according to the flight-tracking service flightaware , nearly 10,000 flights had been canceled for monday and tuesday , almost all related to the storm .	the cancellations have already surpassed those from last year 's damaging hurricane irene .	they 're now on par with a major winter storm in early 2011 .	back then , 14,000 flights were scrapped over four days .	delays rippled across the u.s. , affecting travelers in cities such as san francisco to chicago .	disruptions spread to europe and asia , where airlines canceled or delayed flights to new york and washington from cities that are major travel hubs including london , paris , tokyo and hong kong .	about one-quarter of all u.s. flights travel in or out of new york airports each day .	so cancellations here can dramatically impact travel in other cities .	businessman alan shrem was trying to return home to boca raton , fla. .	his monday morning cathay pacific flight from hong kong to new york 's kennedy airport was canceled .	he learned he could be stuck in hong kong for nearly a week because the next available seat was nov. 4 .	he was put on a waiting list for seats that could become available earlier . "	they just say : yeah , it 's a pretty big waiting list , " said shrem , throwing up his hands .	in the meantime , he 'll have to fork out $ 400 a night to continue staying at a nearby hotel .	the airline wo n't pay for accommodation for stranded passengers if delays are weather related .	by early afternoon , the storm had strengthened to 90 mph and had already knocked out power to tens of thousands of people .	sandy was 110 miles southeast of atlantic city , n.j. , and had turned toward the west , as forecasters feared .	sandy is on track to collide with a wintry storm moving in from the west and cold air streaming down from the arctic .	airports in the metropolitan new york city area are open , but air carriers are not operating .	the port authority of new york and new jersey said monday that travelers should n't even try to go to kennedy , newark liberty , laguardia and stewart airports .	angela gittens , director general of the airports council international who was the aviation director at miami international airport dade during several hurricanes from 2001 to 2004 , said even if storm damage is minor it could be a week before operations are normal at major east coast airports . "	the storm has such a wide swath and so many major airports are involved that it 's going to take some time ( to recover ) because those airplanes are so far away , " gittens said .	jetblue airways corp. expects its cancellations from sunday through tuesday to total about 1,200 .	the airline has hubs at kennedy airport and boston 's logan .	rob maruster , the company 's chief operating officer , hopes flights can resume in new york on wednesday morning .	but he 's worried about flooding of jfk 's runways since they are all basically at sea level and near bodies of water .	delta air lines inc. has canceled 2,100 flights over the three days .	american airlines has scrapped 1,000 flights , including 260 on regional affiliate american eagle .	it 's still too early to assess the impact on airline 's bottom lines .	many of the customers on flights currently being cancelled will reschedule later on , so the airline will still collect the fare .	but the cost of parking planes for days , along with potential damage , will undoubtedly cost airlines millions .	international travelers could wait days to get to the east coast of the u.s. all flights from paris to boston , new york , philadelphia and washington ?	a total of 14 ?	were canceled .	frankfurt airport canceled 12 flights , with german carrier lufthansa scrapping three to the northeast and one out of newark .	british airways had to cancel all its flights to and from new york , newark , baltimore , washington dc , boston and philadelphia ?	a total of 20 .	eight flights out of tokyo 's narita international airport to new york , newark and washington were canceled monday .	hong kong 's cathay canceled its two daily flights to new york for monday and tuesday and air india said its daily flights to newark and jfk had halted since sunday .	south korean flag carrier korean air delayed a flight scheduled to leave incheon international airport for jfk on monday by 22 hours .	asiana airlines delayed its jfk flight from seoul by 26 hours .
a ban on outdoor smoking in new york parks was upheld wednesday by a midlevel court , reversing a judge and dismissing a challenge filed by a smokers ' rights group .	the appellate division , ruling unanimously , said the ban was consistent with the mission of the office of parks , recreation and historic preservation ? "	to allow all patrons to enjoy the fresh air and natural beauty of its outdoor facilities . "	the five justices concluded the agency did n't usurp the legislature 's authority with regulations that banned smoking at state parks in new york city and at designated areas at other parks around the state .	the panel acknowledged there 's no specific legislative directive to restrict park smoking outdoors .	they noted the legislature has prohibited smoking at indoor public spaces and expressed " its determination that tobacco smoke , including secondhand smoke , is hazardous to one 's health . " "	furthermore , the record does not indicate that the designation of no smoking areas continues to be the subject of great public debate , " justice karen peters wrote . "	in fact , 91 percent of the comments that respondents received on this rule were favorable and many commenters expressed their desire that smoking be banned outright in all state parks . "	the rules established no-smoking areas in february 2013 at various parks statewide , including popular beaches and all nine state parks within new york city .	the city has a separate outdoor smoking ban for its parks and beaches , which had city council backing and was n't challenged in this lawsuit .	judge george ceresia ruled last fall that state parks officials exceeded their authority , ordering they stop enforcing the outdoor ban and take down the signs .	he noted that the legislature had previously considered but failed to enact an outdoor ban .	a call to the parks office was not immediately returned .	edward paltzik , attorney for nyc citizens lobbying against smoker harassment , said he 's disappointed ceresia 's ruling was overturned and will encourage his client to appeal .	he had called the previous ruling " a vindication of individual rights in the face of government overreach .

"	we are seeing 11-year-old girls testing positive for being pregnant , " said lujan grisham , who believes the children should have access to doctors . "	so , we need to start testing them even younger now .

"	i 'm worried that we did n't meet our legal requirements when we deported 40 people this week , " she said , referring to the central american women and children sent rom artesia to honduras on monday .	obama administration officials said friday that border patrol agents in the rio grande valley in south texas have found fewer than 500 children crossing the border illegally this week .	last month , agents arrested as many as 2,000 child immigrants a week .

an arizona national guard officer told an arizona house panel tuesday that he went to the press to report misconduct after the guard 's top leadership failed to discipline soldiers caught lying , stealing and sexually exploiting female recruits .	the testimony from lt. col. robert white came weeks after a report prompted by an arizona republic series confirmed what white reported was true .	that report found misconduct uncovered by the republic last year was more pervasive than previously known .	white said he conducted an investigation in 2009 into suspected misconduct by recruiters , and found that non-commissioned offers took female recruits out on " bum hunts " where they would shoot homeless people with paintball guns .	the 17 - and 18-year-old female recruits also were told to show their breasts to the transients , white testified .	he also said that two soldiers lied under oath during his investigation .	when white returned from a pentagon assignment in 2011 , he learned only one person had been disciplined , so he went to two senior officers to find out why . "	this is what maj. gen. ( hugo ) salazar decided to do , " he said he was told .	salazar is the adjutant general in charge of the 8,000-member state guard .	white and other current and former guard members testified at a hearing called by rep. debbie mccune davis , d-phoenix , that they were retaliated against for complaining about wrongdoing that was being ignored by commanders .	only democrats were on the panel , after davis said committees controlled by republicans would n't hold hearings .	republican sen. kelli ward of lake havasu city did attend part of the two-hour hearing as an observer . "	when i went to the press , i knew i was committing career suicide , " said white , who was on active duty but now is a part-time guard officer .	one current officer testified that the newspaper stories focused on misconduct and not the vast majority of guard members who are superb soldiers . "	i was saddened to hear some of the stories i heard today , " said col. steven smith , who heads the 98th regional support group . "	i still believe we have a strong organization .	we have a great organization . "	after the republic began publishing stories about the guard last year that included the recruiting problems and a large number of other issues , gov. jan brewer asked the federal national guard bureau to investigate .	that report released may 2 examined wrongdoing including sexual abuses , drunken driving , narcotics trafficking , embezzlement , retaliation against whistle-blowers and abuses of power .	the report generally found the allegations reported by the republic occurred and were mostly swiftly and effectively addressed .	in some cases , the report found , punishment did n't follow military or state guidelines and was inconsistently administered .	brewer said the report showed the state guard was n't " broken " but ordered a remediation plan .	that plan , released earlier this month , includes increased training and reforms designed to be " catalysts for broad , systemic program change , " salazar wrote in a letter to brewer .	a key priority will be addressing issues of sexual harassment and sexual assault , and some new programs and procedures already have been implemented , including mandatory reporting of alleged misconduct by leadership personnel and revisions of the arizona code of military justice and court-martial policies to enable appropriate disciplinary actions .	the guard will also conduct regular personnel surveys on integrity , leadership and morale issues , developing a tracking system for investigations of misconduct and providing enhanced training and response to sexual harassment and abuse .

a new kansas law that went into effect on friday allows motorcyclists to proceed through an intersection after waiting a reasonable amount of time for a traffic light that stays red .	that law is n't yet on the books in wichita , where running a red light ?	no matter how long the wait ?	can still result in a citation .	the kansas legislature passed the so-called " dead red " law in april to address motorcyclists being stranded at stoplights that wo n't change because their bikes are n't heavy enough to set off sensors in the street that control the signals .	the wichita eagle reports police spokesman lt. doug nolte said as far as his department is concerned , it 's still against the law for a motorcycle to run a red light .	but he said officers are expected to take a common sense approach to enforcing that ordinance . "	we do n't expect them ( motorcyclists ) to sit at a red light for ... 20 minutes , " nolte said . "	we have to give people the opportunity to go through . "	nolte , a motorcycle rider himself , said he has encountered dead reds and understands the issue for bikers .	he said he waits until the signal has gone through its full cycle without sensing his bike , then he rides carefully through the intersection after me makes sure it 's clear .	that 's exactly what the new kansas law allows .	should he ever get pulled over , " i 'll explain it to the officer ... hopefully the officer will be reasonable . "	mike benson , who operates a motorcycle repair shop in hays , said the law will only work if both police and riders act reasonably . "	you as a rider , you ca n't just pull up to a light and go , " he said . "	it 's a good law , but just like any other law it has to be handled with common sense .	it 's implied on both parties . "	benson said he has encountered plenty of dead reds while on his motorcycle , including two near his home .	there are times , he said , when he 's had no choice but to proceed through . "	the nervous part of it is you do n't want to get a ticket , " he said . "	but you ca n't just sit there all day either ?	especially on days like this when it 's hot and you 're basically sitting on top of a 300-degree frying pan . "	elliot funk , a motorcyclist and salesman at alefs harley davidson in park city , said it 's also dangerous to sit still in traffic for an extended period because drivers might not notice a stationary bike . "	being able to run it , if it 's not picking you up , is probably a good move for safety , " he said .
school districts across minnesota announced they will remain closed for yet another day tuesday , as wind chills were expected to reach 35 to 50 degrees below zero .	the latest round of subzero temperatures , high winds and blowing snow already forced many minnesota schools , including the university of minnesota , to stay closed monday .	griffin ferry was among students who knew he 'd have some makeup work because of the unscheduled day off .

shares of yahoo inc. tumbled wednesday after the company disclosed changes at alibaba group , one of china 's most successful internet companies , in which yahoo owns a 43 percent stake .	the spark : yahoo said in a regulatory filing that alibaba has spun off its online payment business , alipay , into a separate company majority-owned by alibaba 's ceo jack ma .	the company said the move was made to " expedite obtaining an essential regulatory license . "	yahoo said it 's in discussions with alibaba about the terms of the restructuring .	but investors were spooked that alipay was transferred to ma 's control before terms were finalized with yahoo .	the background : analysts believe that much of yahoo 's value now lies in its overseas holdings , rather than its struggling u.s.-based operations .	many shareholders have been hoping that yahoo will sell some of its asian assets to raise billions that could either be used to buy back shares or finance an acquisition of a hot startup that could help get people excited about yahoo again .	the analysis : analyst gene munster at piper jaffray said the spin-off was prompted by regulatory concerns about foreign ownership of a chinese payments processor .	he expects yahoo to be compensated for the move .	he said investors are concerned that spinning out alipay also puts yahoo! 's ownership in e-commerce site taobao , another alibaba subsidiary , at risk .	however , he noted that the regulatory concerns about alipay do n't apply to taobao because chinese authorities accept foreign ownership of e-commerce sites .	in a research note , munster said the stock decline presents a buying opportunity for investors .	share action : yahoo shares fell $ 1.56 , or 8.4 percent , to $ 16.99 in afternoon trading .

the wife of one of 13 remaining cuban dissidents jailed since 2003 says a state security official has indicated the men will be freed within a month , the first sign the government still plans to release them since letting a church-negotiated deadline pass .	the official visited diosdado gonzalez at the combinado del sur jail in matanzas on tuesday and gave him the news , his wife alejandrina garcia told the associated press on friday . "	he told him that they would be freed , and that the government 's word had not been broken , " garcia said . "	he said that in 15 to 30 days they would release the 13 . "	gonzalez , a 48-year-old electrician , is serving a 20-year sentence for treason and other charges .	he was among the activists , social commentators and opposition figures rounded up in a 2003 crackdown against peaceful dissent .	cuban president raul castro agreed to release the men during a july 7 sit down with havana 's roman catholic cardinal jaime ortega and then-spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .	the church said the deal called for all 52 of the remaining prisoners to be released within 4 months , a period that ended sunday with no word on their fate .	the government has had no comment on the passing of the deadline , or on whether it still plans to free the prisoners .	cuba has released 39 of the dissidents , sending them into exile in spain along with their families .	the remaining 13 , including gonzalez , have refused to leave the island , a direct challenge to a government that would prefer they take their views elsewhere .	some of the men have told their families they plan to resume their calls for democracy as soon as they are out of jail .	garcia said her husband was told he and the other men would be allowed to return to their homes in cuba .	she said her husband was given permission to call her with the news after his meeting with the security official , who identified himself only as " irvin .

the near-death experience of the descendant of a casper businessman gave life to the century-old buildings descended from a prominent rancher .	the ongoing restoration of the gothberg ranch at the western end of casper mountain by susan littlefield haines also has given hope for other old buildings , schools , trails and cultural sites , said hilery lindmier , executive director of the alliance for historic wyoming . "	it 's inspiring , " lindmier said recently before visitors arrived at the alliance 's open house at the ranch south of the webb creek subdivision , showing how past and present can prosper together . "	it is quite an undertaking , " she said .	martin gothberg , son of a german immigrant and patriarch of the sheep ranch he started in the 1890s , probably would have appreciated the effort .	besides the ranch , gothberg did business in downtown casper , where he owned a buick dealership , speculated in real estate and built a house near 10th and wolcott streets , lindmier said .	the ranch passed out of the family in the late 1950s or early 1960s , was partially subdivided , went through a series of owners and then just went into disrepair .	meanwhile , haines faced a more dramatic crisis . "	i came very close to dying 17 years ago ; i did n't know how much time i had left , " haines said . "	i always wanted to restore a farmhouse . "	her great-grandfather , clarence littlefield , was a newspaperman and oilman in casper , where she sometimes returned for business , she said .	haines joined her family history and personal goals in 1999 when she and her husband bought the dilapidated ranch .	even experts did n't give her much hope , she said . "	the first two contractors told me to level the place . "	she and her husband applied their skills and hired two carpenters to begin the restoration , which meant balancing history and culture with the needs of daily living .	and paying for it . "	private preservation is an ongoing process , " haines said . "	it was all out of my own pocket . "	preservation , lindmier said , means more than freezing a building in time or trying to return it to its original state .	for example , several of the buildings had no foundations other than the logs on the dirt , lindmier said .	so the haineses jacked them up , poured concrete foundations , and lowered the buildings onto new and sturdier bases , she said .	is that original ?	of course not .	but rotting logs eventually lead to no buildings at all , lindmier said . "	you 're ultimately doing that to save the building . "	the haineses are performing similar rescue work in the cavernous barn , she said .	they have erected poles to keep the roof from collapsing , stretched chains to tie other beams together and poured concrete around existing poles to keep them from rotting .	several of the structures lost their originality early on , lindmier said .	the gothbergs , like others who homesteaded , practiced " vernacular architecture , " a big phrase meaning building to suit practical needs , lindmier said .	for example , the bunkhouse started as a small single-room log house that apparently functioned as a blacksmith shop at one time , judging by the soot-stained ceiling , she said .	sometime later , another cabin was moved next to the first building , and lindmier pointed to the wood that patched the gaps between them .	the haineses have converted the bunkhouse into a rental , with the original side having an electric stove for cooking and a reproduction wood stove for heating .	the stone ice house with " 1903 " etched in the gable has been converted into a small apartment , but the casual observer would not notice that from the outside .	haines and her husband renovated the original ranch house and practiced their own form of vernacular architecture by building a new wing .	the carriage house , too , has been remodeled into living quarters and , like the bunkhouse , retains some of the original features , including the hanging door portraying brands of the gothberg and other ranches , lindmier said .	as the haineses continue their work , the nonprofit alliance wants to showcase some of its other projects , including preserving historical schools , monitoring proposed wind farms and transmission lines for their effects on viewsheds and protecting the greater south pass historic landscape and national historic trails , she said . "	we can walk on the oregon trail and see it as the pioneers did , " lindmier said .
millions and millions of lines of computer software code are written around the world every day , advancing technology but also creating an obvious problem .	some of it will be bad , some of it will create unintended consequences and some of it will be malicious .	who keeps track of this stuff ?	and would n't it be nice to find potential problems before they become actual problems , if not disasters ?	researchers from indiana university 's pervasive technology institute are joining the battle and will serve as collaborating partners on a major grant from the u.s. department of homeland security to address vulnerabilities arising during the process of software development .	the department of homeland security awarded a $ 23.6 million grant to the morgridge institute for research at the university of wisconsin-madison to create the software assurance marketplace .	over the next five years , the marketplace will work closely with developers of new software analysis technology and the open source community to advance the security of software , according to iu communications .	as part of the grant , iu 's center for applied cybersecurity research , grid operation center and global research network operations center will receive $ 1.9 million to provide operational monitoring , cybersecurity analysis and user support to the marketplace , the herald-times reported ( http://bit.ly/u7jco3 ) . "	this project demonstrates iu 's unique abilities to leverage institutional strengths in cybersecurity , monitoring and operational support , " iu 's von welch said in an iu news release . "	as a first-of-its-kind system , the software assurance marketplace will introduce new challenges in cybersecurity and operational monitoring , making it a perfect application of the pervasive technology institute 's applied research . "	welch is the deputy director of the center for applied cybersecurity research and will serve as the leader for iu 's participation in the project .	iu also will perform annual risk analysis , lead cybersecurity technical design and operations , develop and maintain policies and procedures for incident detection and response , and lead the handling of cybersecurity-related incidents in the marketplace .	iu personnel will also handle the establishment of a 24/7 call center and trouble ticket system , and will also provide first-tier user support .	initial operating capabilities for the software assurance marketplace will include the ability to continuously test up to 100 open-source software packages against five software assurance tools on eight platforms , including macintosh , linux and windows .	the secure research facility will be able to analyze more than 275 million lines of code per day and also will introduce new tools to reduce the " false positive " readings that now limit the effectiveness of software assurance testing methods . "	false positives are more of a problem than people realize , " welch said . "	with all of those millions of lines of software being written , you 're going to be turning up things that kind of look suspicious but actually are ok .	to stay on top of all of the languages and all of the technologies is a huge , tremendous problem . "	open source software development is also a blessing and a curse , welch said .	on one hand , he said , it enables educational institutions to create software that can be shared , refined and tailored to fit the specific needs of users without having to pay sometimes exorbitant fees to private sector businesses with proprietary products . "	on the other hand , it 's also an open development process and environment , and one has to be careful about who comes along and contributes to such things , " welch said .	the iu cybersecurity specialist said the wisconsin-based marketplace will be constructed in 2013 and expects to be up and online in 2014 .

years in the making , the last days of a stretch of bettendorf businesses in the shadow of the interstate 74 bridge are near .	the changes are evident .	east of the bridge on grant street , there 's an expanse of empty , barren lots .	some of the vacated buildings still bear the signs , some handwritten , directing prospective customers to new locations or phone numbers to call .	then , there are those still remaining .	the quad-city times reports ( http://bit.ly/10mzdaa ) that at the tiddley tap , a piece of paper on the door tells customers walking in that the little tavern 's going-away party is scheduled for july 14 .	a couple of blocks away , at kirby sales and service , 1614 state st. , gino fedrizzi was preparing to take his business on the road .	on the west side of the bridge , deann soults , the owner of crescent cleaners , was contemplating a couple of weeks ago what she would do with her dry-cleaning plant . "	it 's not a comfortable position , " she said . "	what are you going to do ? "	it 's a question that 's been on the minds of many property owners in the area for years .	but now , the question must be answered sooner rather than later .	there is about six months to the end of the year , which is when the iowa department of transportation wants to gain control of all 44 properties needed for the bridge replacement and a major road reconfiguration in downtown bettendorf .	the state had purchased all but five parcels as of the end of last week .	sixteen others have been purchased , but the state has n't yet taken possession .	the state says the end of the year is its goal , although it is somewhat flexible .	three weeks ago , top dot officials and some state lawmakers met with the owners of ross ' restaurant and , afterward , the dot indicated it was flexible about the end-of-year date .	the " vast majority " of properties will be under dot 's control by the end of the year , said martin sankey , director of the dot 's right of way office .	but , he added , " there may be some that spill over into next year . "	melissa freidhof-rogers , ross ' general manager and the owners ' daughter , said two weeks ago the business is considering a possible new location .	she declined to identify it but said it 's not " super far " from the current site . "	interstate access was key to us , " she said .	building owners and tenant businesses have been making these decisions for years .	some decided as far back as 2007 what to do .	but with the end of the year just a summer and autumn away , the time for final choices is drawing near .	the dot plans to seek bids on what it calls the local roads project in the fall of 2014 .	and the need to move utilities and clear land is driving its decision to seek control of the properties by the end of the year , officials say .	the state tries to have land cleared six months before letting bids on a project , said jim schnoebelen , district engineer for the dot .	for ann schroeder , the 83-year-old owner of the tiddley tap , 340 16th st. , that means that her four decades as a bar owner are coming to a close . "	i wo n't rebuild .	i 'm not a young woman , " she said .	schroeder , who works full time for another area company ( and is in her 63rd year there ) , tells of buying the little tavern in the 1970s when she dated a man who was a bartender .	eventually , the boyfriend went away but the bar remained .	and it was n't always easy , she said .	the interest rates were high back when she took out the loan for the bar , and she had a lot at stake . "	i put my home up against it , " she said .	still , she succeeded .	her regulars tell of being decades-long customers .	a matter-of-fact woman who juggled a telephone interview with a reporter while answering other phones at her full-time job , schroeder acknowledged she sees the situation now not in an emotional way , but a businesslike one . "	i 'm sure i 'll cry the day it closes , " she said .	she also notes somebody gave her a replica of the tavern , which brought tears to her eyes .	gino fedrizzi 's plan is different .	he 's staying in business . "	we 're going mobile until i can find a new location , " he said of the business his father started about 40 years ago .	the business has a database of 10,000 customers , he said .	meanwhile , to the west of the bridge , deeann soults still was deciding what to do two weeks ago .	she has other retail locations , but the crescent cleaners building at 13th and grant is where her plant is at .	it 's not an operation that 's easily moved . "	i could go to an industrial park and be fine , but then i lose my retail location , " she said .	besides , she said the money ?	$ 400,000 ?	that she got for her site is n't enough to replace her current operation .	and at 54-years-old , the prospect of a big bank loan is daunting . "	i 'm not old enough to retire , but i 'm almost too old to start over , " she said .	she , like some others , thought she had more time .	but the decision to move up the local streets project last year pushed their move-out time ahead , too .	the project was moved to 2015 after discussions with the city of bettendorf last year .	doug rick , the dot 's project manager , said several plans related to realignment of local roads were put into one plan , so the work to realign downtown streets will be done over one year , rather than over several .	the major part of the project is realigning state and grant streets .	the plan is to reroute state street so it will veer north , beginning at 10th street , and run alongside a newly constructed grant street before eventually curving back down to state at 17th street .	the new alignment of the downtown streets is designed so they will match the new interchange configuration .	it consolidates what are now four on - and off-ramps and a loop ramp so the new ramps will meet at the present-day grant street .	bettendorf city administrator decker ploehn , one of the few public officials who were there for the birth of plans to replace the i-74 bridge , acknowledges the impact all the property purchases have had on this stretch of downtown , not to mention the businesses and property owners themselves . "	it 's pretty barren , " he said of the stretch of downtown .	yet , ploehn points to the lots east of city hall , where old buildings made way for new businesses . "	when the dust settles and state and grant are in .	i think there 's going to be some great redevelopment opportunities , and it will create new tax base , " he said .	but schroeder worries if other businesses move out of the downtown , there wo n't be much left .	however it turns out , the tiddley tap and a lot of other businesses wo n't be there .	of her own little corner of the city , schroeder says , " it will be missed . "
all four florida supreme court justices and 27 appellate judges on tuesday 's ballot appeared headed for retention although some tea party activists and other conservatives tried to make history by kicking a pair of justices off the bench .	if early returns in the yes-no balloting hold up , florida will keep its record intact .	not a single the first merit-retention election in 1978 .	the tea party targets , justices james perry and jorge labarga , had comfortable leads .	with 43 percent of the expected vote counted , perry had 61 percent yes votes and labarga had 58 percent .	their two more conservative colleagues did a bit better .	chief justice charles canady had 67 percent yes votes and justice ricky polston had 65 percent .	some republican politicians and tea party types waged a low-key campaign against perry and labarga using news releases , word-of-mouth and websites .	they are angry at the pair because they voted with the supreme court majority in rejecting for the ballot a state constitutional amendment that would have allowed voters to voice their opposition to president barack obama 's health care plan .	the majority ruled proposed amendment 9 's ballot summary was unclear and inaccurate , the only reasons the court can reject an amendment for the ballot the state conceded the summary was misleading but urged the justices to replace it with the text of the proposal .	the majority cited precedents from past cases to reject that idea .	canady and polston dissented .	they did n't draw organized opposition .	one of amendment 9 's prime sponsors , sen. carey baker of eustis , urged republicans in a letter to reject perry and labarga because they " have time-and-again exceeded their authority and our trust in creating new laws from the bench . "	perry has said the majority did nothing more than follow existing law .

the capitol of virginia , onetime seat of the confederacy , is being converted for a few weeks more in keeping with how it looked at the close of the civil war ?	for filming scenes from steve spielberg 's major production , " lincoln . "	spielberg and members of his production company were guests monday night of gov. bob mcdonnell at virginia 's executive mansion , just a few hundred feet from the state capitol .	on the grounds of the 200-year-old seat of virginia government , the grass is going without mowing in spots for some weeks to give it a more natural appearance at the request of the filmmakers .	lincoln visited richmond after the fall of the confederacy in 1865 , shortly before his assassination .	rita mcclenny , head of the virginia film office , said spielberg 's moviemakers will be filming on capitol square in richmond and other locations including petersburg this fall through december .	the film stars daniel day-lewis in the title role and sally field as mary todd lincoln .	richmond 's urban area and the capitol complex in particular have served as the set for movies many times before .	the capitol 's south lawn and the south portico , which were initially designed by thomas jefferson , doubled as the white house exterior in " dave .

committee members wrote in a letter thursday to interior secretary ken salazar that they were responding to an associated press investigation released last week on the 27,000 abandoned wells in the gulf .	the ap reported that the wells are not routinely inspected when plugged or subsequently monitored for leaks . "	these wells could pose an additional danger to the gulf coast environment and economy , " wrote u.s. rep. henry waxman , d-calif. , chairman of the house energy and commerce committee , and rep. edward markey , d-mass. , who heads the subcommittee on energy and environment .	they asked for details on the number of wells as well as leaking and inspection requirements .	they asked for an initial reply by monday .	some wells have been abandoned in the gulf since drilling first began in federal waters in the 1940s .	oil companies leave them behind when they are done using them to explore or produce .	of 50,000 wells ever drilled in the gulf , 23,500 have been permanently abandoned , the ap reported .	another 3,500 are classified as " temporarily abandoned , " but some have been left in that condition since the 1950s without the full safeguards of permanent abandonment .	petroleum engineers say that even in properly sealed wells , cement plugs can fail over the decades and the metal casing that lines the wells can rust .	even depleted production wells can repressurize over time and spill oil if their seals fail .	bp plc was temporarily abandoning the deepwater horizon well when it blew out on april 20 , killing 11 workers .	in response to the ap investigation , leading environmental groups have called for the government to study the possible extent of leaking wells , to conduct work inspections and to monitor abandoned wells over the years .	sen. mark udall , d-colo. , sent a separate letter last week asking salazar whether regulators have authority to conduct inspections of abandoned wells .	he said regulators may ultimately need to check industry paperwork more carefully or inspect the work themselves .	on thursday , kendra barkoff , a spokeswoman for the interior department , said the agency was reviewing the latest congressional request .	she added that " without question , we must raise the bar for all offshore oil and gas operations . "	she gave few details but said the agency is evaluating " a series of options " to make sure that well operators can afford the costs of abandonment .	oil and gas companies eventually will have to spend at least $ 3 billion to perform permanent plugging on wells in federal waters , according to estimates of the newly named u.s. bureau of energy management , regulation and enforcement , which regulates offshore drilling .	in its investigation , the ap found a series of past warnings about the risks at abandoned wells .	the government accountability office , which investigates for congress , warned that leaks could cause an " environmental disaster . "	the u.s. environmental protection agency has estimated that up to 17 percent of abandoned wells are improperly plugged on land .

white house spokesman josh earnest said the homeland security and state departments have been asked to review the process for screening people who apply for visas and to return with specific recommendations .	the homeland security department said it is specifically reviewing policies on when authorities at u.s. citizenship and immigration services can look at social media posts as part of the vetting process for would-be immigrants applying for certain visas . "	i think the president 's top priority here is the national security and safety of the american people , " earnest said . "	and that will continue to be the case with ensuring that this k-1 visa program is effectively implemented . "	tashfeen malik , a pakistani woman who the fbi says carried out an attack with her husband in san bernardino , california , that killed 14 people earlier this month , came to the united states in 2014 on a k-1 , or fiancé , visa .	earnest did not provide specifics of the security review for visas , but said one consideration going forward is resources .	the government approved more than 9.9 million visa applications during the 2014 budget year .	malik 's background check included at least one in-person interview in pakistan and another after marrying syed farook , who was born in illinois .	she also had to provide fingerprints and a variety of background information .	authorities also vetted her using intelligence and law enforcement databases .	the day after the attack , facebook found a post on a page maintained by malik pledging her and farook 's allegiance to the leader of the islamic state group .	the page was under an alias .	authorities have said malik and farook exchanged messages about jihad and martyrdom online before they were married and while she was living in pakistan .	the history of malik 's radicalization and her apparent online discussions about jihad have raised concerns about how she was able to pass a background check that the government has described as rigorous .	sen. richard burr , a north carolina republican who heads the senate intelligence committee , said on cbs ' " face the nation " sunday that farook was radicalized as early as 2010 and malik as far back as 2012 , which would have been years before her visa was processed . "	we want to look at how our immigration process for a visa for a spouse broke down , that they did n't notice the radicalization , " burr said .	certain dhs officials are currently allowed to look at social media posts as part of law enforcement investigations .	the possible policy changes are being considered at uscis , the dhs agency in charge of managing immigration benefits cases and interviewing green card applicants .	malik was interviewed by uscis after marrying farook .	the fbi has said the couple was not on its radar until after the attacks and the shootout with police hours later that ended in their death . "	i do n't think there are any indications that there was public use of social media that was missed , and we are looking into other questions about how they may have communicated to each other that avoided our detection , " said rep. adam schiff , d-calif. , after being briefed by law enforcement late last week .	allowing visa vetters to review social media postings is no guarantee that a would-be immigrant who has radicalized views will be discovered .	facebook and twitter users can make their pages private and aliases are routinely employed .	sen. dianne feinstein , d-calif. , and sen. richard burr , r-n.c .	, introduced legislation last week that would require social media companies to report to law enforcement any " terrorist activity " they became aware of -- for example , attack planning , recruiting or the distribution of terrorist material .	but technology industry representatives say that would become a massive new liability for companies , chill free speech online and increase the number of reports funneled to law enforcement , making it difficult to find credible threats .
republican gubernatorial hopeful and former u.s. rep. asa hutchinson says he wants to cut arkansas ' income tax rate , starting with the middle class .	hutchinson said tuesday that , if elected , he would seek to reduce the income tax rate for people earning between $ 20,400 and $ 75,000 .	hutchinson says the tax cuts under his plan would cost about $ 100 million .	he says that can be paid for with existing growth and surplus funds .	hutchinson , little rock businessman curtis coleman and state rep. debra hobbs are seeking the gop nomination for governor .	former u.s. rep. mike ross is seeking the democratic nomination .	democratic gov. mike beebe is term-limited and ca n't seek re-election next year .	ross 's campaign said tuesday that ross has said he would implement income tax cuts that target working families .

three of indiana 's environmental groups urged the federal government friday to move quickly to approve proposed regulations intended to cut industrial mercury emissions , saying the rules would reduce indiana residents ' exposure to the toxic metal .	the groups made their plea hours before the republican-controlled u.s. house passed a bill that 's now before the senate which would delay or scrap proposed rules that would reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions .	republicans want the obama administration to study the impact that the rules would have on jobs , electricity , gasoline prices and buy time for the economy to recover .	but members of the sierra club 's hoosier chapter , the hoosier environmental council and improving kids ' environment said the proposed federal rules would help safeguard indiana residents from mercury , a heavy metal that can harm young children .	indiana gets about 95 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants that release about 6,000 pounds of mercury into the air each year , said bowden quinn , the sierra club hoosier chapter 's conservation coordinator .	a u.s. geological survey study released last year of indiana 's rivers and streams for five years showed high mercury levels in those waters .	during a friday news conference , quinn said testing on hair samples the sierra club collected from 38 people in indianapolis in april showed traces of mercury in every sample , with three samples testing above the e.p.a. 's health guideline for mercury . "	these results clearly show that mercury emissions from power plants are affecting people here in indianapolis , " quinn said .	airborne mercury falls in precipitation and enters waterways , where it accumulates in the food chain , posing a risk to people who eat tainted fish .	women who eat fish tainted with mercury can unwittingly harm the brains and nervous systems of their developing fetuses or breast-fed babies .	jodi perras , executive director of improving kids ' environment , said mercury poses a serious health threat to infants and can harm the brain , spinal cord , kidneys and liver . "	it is especially dangerous to unborn babies and young children , whose brains and nervous system are still developing , " she said .	dr. gabriel filippelli , a professor of earth sciences at iupui , said tests he recently conducted in indianapolis that showed that mercury from local power plants is deposited on the ground and enters the white river 's sediments .	marion county health department director virginia caine said her department has posted signs at fishing spots on the white river and other waterways that warn of the risk from eating locally caught fish .	jesse kharbanda , executive director of the hoosier environmental council , said indiana needs to lessen its reliance on coal and generate more of its electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind power to catch up with more aggressive efforts in adjoining illinois and ohio .
an alaska wildfire that burned into the town of healy produced a lot of smoke but was quickly contained around five acres with only minor damage reported .	officials said the natural barrier of the healy spur road helped limit the sunday blaze that consumed plenty of black spruce trees . "	if this road had n't been here , we 'd have a huge problem on our hands for sure , " said zane brown , incident commander from the alaska department of forestry .	healy residents began reporting smoke at about 12:30 p.m. sunday .	denali borough mayor dave talerico told the fairbanks news-miner that when he drove the healy spur road at 12:50 p.m. , flames were reaching higher than the 30-foot telephone poles . "	it was rippin ' and roarin , ' " talerico said .	tri-valley volunteer fire department firefighters responded from across the street from the blaze .	they were joined by firefighters from mckinley village , panguingue creek , the national park service and others .	usibelli coal mine provided tanker trucks and heavy equipment , as did princess tours .	golden valley electric association and local business people also assisted .	it did n't take long for heavy equipment operators to knock down trees and create a firebreak around the blaze . "	they did a good job getting it contained , " said brown .	a small cabin behind mountain view store sustained fire damage and there was minimal damage to a storage shed .	a seven-man crew from fairbanks was due to arrive to make sure all hot spots were extinguished .	brown said he expected the crew would monitor the area for a couple days .	a campfire is suspected of starting the blaze .
illnesses in seven more people have been tied by to the consumption of raw milk from a farm in sibley county that was implicated in an e. coli outbreak earlier this year , the minnesota department of health reported thursday .	three people were infected with a bacterium called campylobacter jejuni and the other four with a parasite , cryptosporidium parvum , after drinking raw milk .	all seven reported drinking raw milk , and those who named a source said it was the hartmann dairy farm , the department said .	laboratory tests determined the bacterium and parasite in most of the ill people were genetically identical to samples taken from the farm this summer .	both result in similar symptoms , including fever , diarrhea and vomiting .	cryptosporidium can be life threatening for people with weak immune systems . "	we know all these things are carried by cattle and transmitted by raw milk .	it 's not unexpected , " said kirk smith , a foodborne diseases expert with the health department . "	whatever is in cow poop is going to wind up in raw milk .	it is impossible to produce raw milk without those kinds of things happening . "	a telephone listing for michael hartmann , the farm owner , ran unanswered thursday , and a man who has served as hartmann 's spokesman in the past did not return telephone or e-mail messages .	hartmann has said that his farm is no less sanitary than other dairy farms .	smith said the seven people were sickened from late july to late august .	he said the lag between the illnesses and the department 's report thursday was due to the time needed for the investigation and laboratory tests .	the department said it has identified 47 other people who became ill since jan. 1 , 2010 , after drinking raw milk from a variety of other sources throughout the state .	most of those cases have been young adults or children .	hartmann 's farm was implicated as the source of an outbreak of eight confirmed e. coli infections in may and june .	in response , the minnesota department of agriculture ordered hartmann to stop selling all milk until he remedied the unsanitary conditions on the farm .	nichole neeser , who leads the dairy inspection program for the state agriculture department , said the restriction remained in effect thursday .	because of an ongoing investigation of the farm , she said she could n't comment further .	also this summer , the department prohibited the sale of specific lots of meat , cheese and other dairy products from the farm .	hartmann fought the embargo in sibley county court .	neeser said arguments finished in late september and the judge has n't yet ruled .	federal and state regulators have said raw milk carries a risk of disease because it has n't been through the germ-destroying pasteurization process .	however , interest in raw milk has been growing among those who think pasteurization reduces milk 's nutritional value .	nine u.s. states allow retail sales of raw milk , while another 19 ?	including minnesota ?	allow only direct sales from farmers to consumers .
a colorado wildfire that has destroyed 170 homes showed no signs of relenting thursday as wind gusts of more than 40 mph fueled fears that the flames would move east from the rocky mountain foothills and into the heart of boulder , where some residents were warned to be ready to flee .	officials worried about a repeat of the devastation in the foothills , where neighborhoods once filled with million-dollar homes and scenic mountain cabins have become piles of smoking rubble .	on one lot , all that survived was a tennis court .	on others , all that 's left are crumbling , ash-covered foundations .	authorities told residents on the west side of boulder to be prepared to evacuate if the wildfire moves into town .	they urged people to remove lawn furniture , brush and propane tanks that could fuel the fire .	the city also mowed grass in open spaces to reduce potential fuel and told residents to do the same .	the city encouraged residents to gas up and park their cars pointed toward the road for a speedy getaway , wet down yards and vegetation and pack up important documents , medication and other items in case they had to flee .	but the leader of the national team that took over management of the fire seemed to play down the threat .	jim thomas told reporters late thursday that he did n't see imminent danger for boulder , although he added that conditions can change and there 's always a risk of a major fire spreading . "	i 'm not aware of any real threat to the city of boulder right now , " thomas said .	a containment line has been dug around about 30 percent of the 10-square-mile fire , although the line is n't continuous .	thomas said he could n't predict when the fire would be fully contained .	boulder is a city of about 100,000 people that is home to the university of colorado and the national institute of standards and technology , a federal laboratory best known for running the atomic clock that 's used to maintain the official u.s. time .	authorities said the biggest fire danger was north of downtown and west of broadway , one of boulder 's main thoroughfares .	the federal lab is on broadway farther south , and the edge of the campus is on the eastern side of the street .	many sorority and fraternity houses are on the western side .	by thursday evening , west-northwest winds in the foothills had reached 15-25 mph with occasional gusts above 40 mph .	the strongest winds were expected friday morning , said national weather service meteorologist scott entrekin in boulder .	a red flag warning , signaling high fire danger , was in effect for the broader region through friday evening .	it was n't the first time that boulder has faced a wildfire threat .	the city has mountain parks and abundant public open space considered potential trouble spots when fires have started in the mountains .	a january 2009 wildfire crept up to boulder 's northern outer edges , but the city escaped unscathed .	sprinklers were running in yards in parts of west boulder and people put bags into cars .	joe glynn hosed down his yard in northwest boulder and his 9-year-old son , daniel , sprayed water on city open space next to their lot .	his family packed bags in case they had to flee , but glynn ?	who has witnessed two other wildfires ?	said he would stay behind and protect his home of 19 years . "	i 'm going to stand on the roof with a hose if necessary , " he said .	in a neighborhood further south , peter cowan was gathering his credit cards , financial papers and pictures . "	i got the warning , " cowan said . "	i 'm not in a panic , but i 'm not going to ignore it . "	caitlin kolibas , 22 , a university of colorado senior who lives west of broadway in an area called university hill , said her parents in new jersey were " trying to get me a little more concerned . "	the university held evening classes as usual . "	it sounds like more of an official precaution ... a superfluous precaution , " said spencer everett , 22 , of phoenix , who just graduated from the school .	william witte , who works at a bike store on the hill across from campus , took the warning to heart .	he knows people who lost their home in the fire and is aware boulder could be in trouble if the fire jumps over the last row of mountains . "	everybody who lives here knows how bad the winds can be , " witte said .	the preparations in boulder reflect the ferocity of the wildfire since it broke out monday and spread over roughly 6,300 acres .	it has since become one of the most destructive fires in colorado , destroying more homes than any other blaze in state history .	about 3,500 people have been out of their homes for four days , and some have been frustrated with a lack of information about what was happening behind fire lines because they could n't do more to help .	about 1,000 people were allowed to check on their homes thursday morning .	about 25 people refused to leave when the winds picked up and people were ordered out .	boulder county sheriff 's cmdr. rick brough said authorities know where the people are and will go door to door if the fire flares up again .	other people have gotten around roadblocks by foot or bike .	lee mccormack made a trip to his house early thursday but was stopped at a roadblock in the afternoon .	mccormack , who was riding a bicycle , had planned to get more belongings , including his car and his wife 's favorite laundry detergent , but could n't talk an officer into letting him through . "	it 's shut down .	it does n't matter how much you plead , " mccormack . "	i gave the cop a power bar and he still would n't let me up there .

with state health officials advancing plans to help provide uninsured new yorkers with health coverage under president barack obama 's health care overhaul , thursday 's u.s. supreme court ruling to uphold universal coverage was being celebrated at places like a network of neighborhood medical clinics in new york city . "	it 's really not melodramatic to say that lives are going to be profoundly affected for the better , " said dr. daniel baxter , top medical officer for the william f. rayn community health network . "	this means that children are going to be able to get their immunizations , women are going to be able to get appropriate cancer screening , people with diabetes are going to be treated . "	in april , gov. andrew cuomo issued an executive order to establish a statewide exchange starting in 2014 , a marketplace where individuals and small businesses could tap into as much as $ 2.6 billion in federal tax credits and subsidies under the overhaul law .	it is meant to insure every american , mainly those who do n't have employer health plans or do n't qualify for medicaid .	the u.s. supreme court upheld the overhaul 's main provisions thursday .	right now , between 20 to 30 percent of the ryan network 's patients are uninsured , he said .	not all are poor .	in these lean economic times , baxter said he has seen a growing number of patients who have lost their private health insurance when they lost good-paying jobs .	the uninsured still get care , he said , but many patients often forgo treatment or precautionary measures rather than risk getting a big bill .	one uninsured patient skipped a recommended x-ray a year ago because she did n't have insurance .	as a result , baxter said , it took an extra year for doctors to discover that she had cancer .	the law will also be a financial boon for places like the ryan network .	baxter said the health centers have long received some government reimbursement for treating the uninsured , but he said it has never been close to covering costs . "	had the law been overturned , many community health centers would find their viability in jeopardy , " he said .	in buffalo , liz and tim evans have health insurance now through liz 's employer , medaille college , but have gone without it for periods of years while employed part-time .	at nearly $ 1,000 a month , it was too expensive . "	i did n't really know how i felt about ( the law ) until the ruling .	i was relieved and pleased it was upheld , " liz evans said . "	i 'm glad my daughter is going to be covered until she 's 26 , " said evans , a college librarian whose daughter is 12 . "	we 've been in the position before of having pre-existing conditions and having to wait for coverage so i 'm glad that 's gone . "	evans has a thyroid condition , and her husband , a laid-off carpenter , has diabetes .	state attorney general eric schneiderman said his office stands ready to enforce the law to ensure new yorkers benefit from its protections , calling the court 's decision a " historic victory " for millions of americans . "	this law will continue to provide a spectrum of key consumer protections including keeping young adults on their parents ' plans , ending pre-existing condition restrictions and increasing consumer information about health care choices , " he said .	under cuomo 's order , issued after legislation to establish the exchange stalled in the republican-controlled state senate , health officials plan to show by january that the state is ready to participate in the federal program .	the goal is to have the exchange operating on jan. 1 , 2014 , health department spokesman peter constantakes said .	new york has about 11 million residents who are insured , mainly through employer health plans , and 5 million low-income residents enrolled in medicaid .	census data from last year showed nearly 2.9 million new york residents , or about 15 percent , without insurance , although the state estimate is 2.7 million ?	mainly working poor who do n't have employer-sponsored coverage and medicaid-eligible residents who have n't registered .	the business council of new york state said employers already struggle with high coverage costs , taxes and surcharges , and the supreme court 's ruling does nothing to " bend the cost curve . "	the group said it will work to assure the exchange has full participation by insurers , agents , brokers , chambers of commerce and employers in all stages of development for " as robust a health insurance market and health care delivery system as possible . "	an assortment of tax increases , health industry fees and medicare cuts are supposed to pay for the changes .	starting in 2014 , almost everyone will be required to be insured , with some exceptions , or pay a yearly fine .	that would be $ 695 per person up to $ 2,085 per household , or 2.5 percent of household income , whichever is greater . "	we disagree with the supreme court 's decision to affirm a massive tax increase that people can not afford right now , " said scott reif , spokesman for the senate republican conference .	associated press writer carolyn thompson in buffalo contributed to this report .

jennifer aberl gaped in horror at her 8-year-old son when he said he hopes to make it to 100 surgeries .	shawn aberl ii , a third-grader at new highland elementary school , already has experienced more than 60 surgeries .	his parents are n't sure exactly how many there have been , but the boy counts 65 .	he thinks 100 is a good number .	jennifer and her husband , shawn , both sergeants first class with the u.s. army human resource command , did not know until their son 's birth that anything was wrong .	then , a doctor told them after an emergency caesarean section in an alaskan hospital that the baby had a club foot and a cleft lip , which required surgery so he could nurse properly .	shawn said it " was kind of overwhelming " trying to learn about and keep track of all the newborn 's needs as the concerns piled up .	the next news was that the foot was n't clubbed .	the leg was deformed , with the infant 's heel pulled up toward his groin .	it could not be straightened without discomfort .	the boy was diagnosed at madigan army medical center in washington with popliteal pterygium syndrome seven weeks after his birth .	it took that long to diagnose because it was the first time the doctors had seen and recognized the condition .	it typically results in death before birth .	the boy had a slight chance of being born alive .	the parents had the option of amputating the limb , but their insurance and support from the army allowed them to proceed with the expensive procedures and equipment .	the treatments allow the boy to leap over the living room table ?	to his mother 's chagrin ?	and dash around the house while his parents keep time .	he ran with a slight hop last week to complete the circuit in 12 seconds before rushing out to show off his elbow drop on the trampoline outside .	his father said the family is lucky to be in a position to treat the condition , rather than having to lose the leg . "	not every family has that , " he said . "	not everyone has medical care .	that 's why save-a-limb exists . "	the aberl family moved to elizabethtown in april and is raising money for the oct. 22 save-a-limb bike ride in maryland .	the ride helps support the efforts of sinai hospital in baltimore to prevent limbs from being amputated when they can be saved .	shawn ii has been treated there .	a major reason for amputation is lack of coverage , especially because some insurance companies consider the limb-saving procedures to be cosmetic changes .	this is the fifth time the aberl family has volunteered with the ride and the second year they have raised money for the cause .	the family already has surpassed the $ 500 they have collected in previous years .	they set a new goal of $ 5,000 .	donations in the boy 's name can be made at www.savealimbride.kintera.org/superhero or by putting his name on the " memo " line of a check mailed to sinai hospital of baltimore-riao , care of save a limb fund , 2401 w. belvedere ave. , baltimore , md 21215 .	the boy also might be asked to share his story during the event , as he has with soldiers at walter reed army medical center in washington , d.c , where he has received treatment .	the boy has spent years casually confronting pain and the possibility of death on an endless number of operating tables .	he had webbing removed from between his fingers , alterations to his cleft lip and alterations to his leg to straighten it without disrupting delicate nerves in a webbed portion behind his leg .	webbing between his toes will remain because its removal could cause the child to lose a toe .	he prepared for one trip to the operating room by giving his parents a nonchalant goodbye and telling them to grab breakfast while he was in the operating room .	it 's hard for the parents to relax , especially after nearly losing their son twice in 2009 from an allergic reaction to a sedative .	every third day for four months after that surgery , the boy had to go back to the hospital to have dead skin removed .	the most concern he has showed was when his baby sister came home when he was 4 years old .	panicked , he told his mother that there was something wrong because she did n't have webbed toes .	jennifer said her son was worried that his sister would have to go through the challenges that he has . "	i had to tell him that he 's special , " she said . "	we had to explain to him that not every kid has to go through what he goes through . "	she said her son , who was determined in kindergarten to grow up to be a superhero , makes the situation feel normal .	surgeries will continue for the boy as his growth demands alterations to his lip and further stretching of his leg .	he smiled widely and said that he 's not scared .

north dakota 's " onerous " primary election vote requirements block candidates who represent lesser-known parties from running in the november election , when their support is likely to be stronger , an attorney told a federal appeals court wednesday .	north dakota 's libertarian party and three of its 2010 legislative candidates are suing to invalidate the law , which kept libertarian state senate candidate richard ames and two north dakota house candidates , thommy passa and anthony stewart , off last year 's november general election ballot .	the law says legislative candidates who run in a political party 's primary must get a minimum number of votes ?	equal to at least 1 percent of the population of a candidate 's legislative district ?	to qualify for the general election .	ames was running in a southeastern north dakota district that included wahpeton and eastern richland county .	stewart and passa were candidates in two different grand forks districts .	they needed between 131 and 143 votes to advance , but none of them got more than eight votes .	oliver hall , an attorney for the libertarians , argued wednesday that it made little sense to bar primary candidates who were running unopposed from going on the november ballot .	north dakota 's law is " onerous " and " an outlier , unique in the entire nation , " said hall , who is a staff attorney for the center for competitive democracy in washington , d.c. no third-party legislative candidate has qualified for the general election since 1976 , hall said in a court filing .	to get their own ballot column alongside democrats and republicans , the libertarian party had to collect more than 7,000 petition signatures , which indicated statewide support for its goals , hall said during wednesday 's arguments .	most north dakotans already skip primary elections , and those who do vote usually gravitate to the democratic and republican candidates , hall said .	once a voter picks a party column , north dakota law requires the voter to stick with it , which puts libertarians at a disadvantage , he said . "	is the primary election result a reasonable measure of support for m minor party candidates ? "	hall asked . "	the answer is no . "	douglas bahr , an assistant attorney general , said hall 's legal arguments were based on u.s. supreme court cases that focused on ballot access .	the libertarians were able to get their names on the primary ballot , but they were n't able to muster the support they needed to advance , bahr said . "	they have the opportunity to go out and say , ' my platform ... is the best .	show up at the primary and vote for me so i can move on to the general election , ' " bahr said . "	how can you say you 're a legitimate candidate when you can only garner four votes ? "	the libertarian party and the three candidates sued north dakota secretary of state al jaeger after he declined to certify them for the november 2010 general election ballot .	in september , u.s. district judge ralph erickson sided with jaeger and dismissed the case .	the libertarians appealed , and bahr and hall argued their cases wednesday before a three-judge appeals panel in st. paul , minn. .	north dakota lawmakers mostly ignored the issue during their 2011 session , which concluded last month .	rep. corey mock , d-grand forks , introduced legislation that would have allowed north dakotans to vote for candidates of more than one party during the state 's june primary election , but it was defeated .

britain 's highest court has ruled in favor of a hospital that gained court approval to withhold treatment from a terminally ill man despite the family 's opposition .	in a unanimous judgment handed down on wednesday , the supreme court ruled that the court of appeal was correct in allowing aintree university hospital in liverpool to withhold treatment from david james , 68 , who suffered colon cancer , organ failure and a stroke , among other problems .	james ' doctors estimated he had a 1 percent chance of survival and applied to the court of protection for a legal declaration allowing it to discontinue some types of treatment .	the court rejected the application on dec. 6 , but 15 days later the court of appeal reversed the decision .	by that time , james ' condition had worsened , and he died on dec. 31 .	james ' family argued that his care should have continued .	the supreme court judges concluded that where treatment is futile , " it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment , " even if this results in the patient 's death .	james ' family said they believed he would have wanted to continue being treated and that he had not reached the point where treatment was hopeless .	but lawyers for the hospital said james had severe physical and neurological damage , was steadily deteriorating and that further invasive treatments would put him at greater risk . "	when you ca n't consent , the law says we only treat you when it 's in your best interests , " said penney lewis , a professor and medical law expert at king 's college london .	she said british courts have previously ruled that preserving life is not always in the patient 's best interests and that judges must weigh whether treatment would have any benefit for the patient , even if it does n't cure them .	though some treatments which result in minimal improvement might be considered worthy for some patients , such as those in intensive care , lewis said that criterion was n't met in james ' case by the time the case went to the court of appeal , which ruled he had no chance of improving . "	the time had indeed come when it was no longer premature to say that it would not be in his best interests to attempt to restart his heart should it stop beating , " the judges wrote in their decision .

the confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation have opened a hunting season for gray wolves on their reservation that sprawls across 1.4 million acres in northeast washington , saying wolves have reduced the number of deer and elk that tribal members hunt for food .	meanwhile , washington state wildlife officials are working with ranchers in the region to take proactive steps to avoid conflicts between livestock and wolves , after the state garnered criticism for killing a wolf pack that had been preying on livestock in the state 's northeast corner .	the tribal hunt opened two weeks ago , though no wolves have been killed yet , according to tribal chairman john sirois . "	we just believe we may have a few too many , " sirois said . "	so when we authorized the hunt , we wanted to find an appropriate way to manage wolves and keep a balance for fish and wildlife . "	under the colvilles ' hunting regulations , up to three wolves may be killed in each of three regions on the southern half of the reservation northwest of spokane .	the season closes feb. 28 , 2013 or when all of the wolves allowed to be killed are taken in a given zone .	the tribes are continuing to develop a management plan for wolves going forward , sirois said .	gray wolves were eliminated as a breeding species in washington by the 1930s , but they have since migrated to washington from idaho , oregon and british columbia .	they are listed as endangered throughout washington under state law and the western two-thirds of the state under federal law .	a wolf management plan approved late last year requires 15 successful breeding pairs for three consecutive years to remove endangered species protections .	four breeding pairs would be required in eastern washington , the north cascades and the south cascades or northwest coast , as well as three other pairs anywhere in the state .	there are currently eight confirmed wolf packs in the state ?	five of them in the state 's northeast corner .	four other packs are suspected but not yet confirmed .	earlier this year , the washington department of fish and wildlife hired marksmen to shoot and kill members of the wedge pack , which was believed to have killed or injured at least 15 cattle from the diamond m herd that grazes in a large area near the canadian border .	dave ware , the agency 's game division manager , said tuesday that state officials have been attending meetings with livestock producers to give them technical advice and offer expertise about avoiding conflicts with wolves in the future .	ware also said hunters have been calling in numerous sightings of wolves in recent weeks , and wildlife officials will be working to survey wolf populations and capture and collar wolves this winter .	at least one wolf in seven of the eight confirmed packs has been collared already , allowing wildlife officials to better track their movements .	the lookout pack in okanogan county is the only pack without a collared wolf .

cleveland county district judge lori walkley handed down the ruling in the case of alton nolen , 31 , who is charged in the september 2014 attack that left colleen hufford , 54 , dead and a second co-worker injured at the vaughan foods plant in south oklahoma city .	in a written order , the judge noted that nolen graduated from high school , attended college and could socialize with others . "	the fact that he does not agree with the strategy of his attorneys does not mean he is incompetent , " walkley wrote .	she ordered that proceedings resume in the criminal case against nolen .	investigators said nolen had just been suspended from his job when he walked into the company 's administrative office and attacked hufford with a large knife , severing her head .	he then repeatedly stabbed co-worker traci johnson , authorities say , before he was shot by mark vaughan , a reserve sheriff 's deputy and the company 's chief operating officer .	johnson survived the attack .	nolen 's attorneys had claimed he was unable to help them prepare his defense and thus should not stand trial .	they asked walkley to send nolen to the oklahoma forensic center for more testing .	prosecutors argued that nolen could communicate with his attorneys if he wanted to .	walkley 's decision came following two days of testimony during which psychologists for each side offered opposing opinions about whether nolen is competent .
an often-criticized initiative to rebuild superstorm sandy-damaged homes has started work on more than 130 , finished 30 and dispensed more than $ 6.3 million to reimburse homeowners for reconstruction costs , mayor bill de blasio said thursday .	he said the city is on track to keep its promise of starting work on 500 homes and sending out 500 reimbursement checks by labor day .	de blasio made the promise three months ago , amid widespread frustration with the program , which former mayor michael bloomberg announced in june 2013 .	as of april , only nine homes were undergoing work , and none had been finished .	changes include eliminating income categories that had prevented some applications from moving forward while others were pending .	the 132 homes underway represent just over a quarter of the goal the city has vowed to reach within six weeks , but officials said the pace was picking up .	some 2,500 homeowners have now ok 'd a repair plan ?	1,500 of them in the past three months ?	and about 650 of those projects are in the design phase , said amy peterson , the head of build it back . "	we are absolutely confident that we will meet that goal , " de blasio said . "	we are going to keep that promise . "	he spoke outside a brooklyn home that had its basement flooded by sandy .	the owner , tonyelle jobity , who manages a state-run group home for the mentally disabled , maxed out her credit cards and emptied her savings account doing what repairs she could while waiting a year and a half for help from the city , de blasio said .	she lived in the damaged home in the meantime .	on thursday , seven workers provided by build it back fastened plywood to a leaking part of her roof .	the program also was slated to fix her basement and boiler room .	it has reimbursed her for what she spent , de blasio said . "	she was just ready to give up hope , " said her sister , cynthia johnson . "	then this comes along .	so it 's a blessing . "	still , much work remains for the city program .	peterson said about 20,000 homeowners have applied to build it back , and the city expects at least 15,000 still need work done ?	some of its substantial .	while many homes need relatively limited repairs , many others need to be elevated to protect against future storm flooding , about about 750 need to be rebuilt completely , peterson said . "	we want to get the vast majority of the work done this year and next year , " de blasio said .

repealing the law , the white house warned tuesday , would end protections for americans with pre-existing conditions such as arthritis , asthma , cancer , heart disease and high blood pressure .	nationally , as many as 129 million could be affected .	the report from the department of health and human services was released tuesday by the white house as republican leaders in the house of representatives initiated their effort to overturn the patient protection and affordable care act , which president barack obama signed into law last march .	most of the law 's provisions would take effect in 2014 .	insurers would be barred from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions .	also beginning in 2014 , consumers would be able to shop for coverage through state-based exchanges . "	the new law is already helping to free americans from the fear that an insurer will drop , limit or cap their coverage when they need it most , " hhs secretary kathleen sebelius said in a statement .	repealing the health care law became a battle cry for republicans and tea party activists during the 2010 midterm election campaigns .	having won control of the house , gop leaders are making good on their pledge to bring the issue up for a vote .	the house is expected to vote wednesday .	republicans contend the health care law will cost jobs , hurt small businesses and add to the deficit .	they scoff at a congressional budget office analysis concluding that repeal would add about $ 230 billion to the deficit over 10 years .	wisconsin 's two freshmen house republicans , sean duffy of ashland and reid ribble of de pere , are expected to join their colleagues in voting for repeal . "	the current health care law is far too expensive and far-reaching , and i intend to vote for its repeal , " ribble said . "	however , there are certain parts of the bill that i have said all along that i do support and will work to reform .	the creation of high-risk pools for patients with pre-existing conditions is one part , as is allowing children to remain under their parents ' insurance for a longer period of time . "	the health care law established a high-risk pool to cover uninsured people with pre-existing conditions until the ban against denying coverage to such people takes effect in 2014 .	daniel son , a spokesman for duffy , said hhs and the white house are exaggerating the impact that repeal would have on that group . "	if it were true that there are 129 millions americans with pre-existing conditions , why have only 8,000 applied for coverage under obamacare 's new high-risk pool ? "	son asked . "	if anything like the number of individuals claimed in the hhs report applied for high-risk pool coverage , the $ 5 billion in spending allocated to the program between now and 2014 would quickly be exhausted . "	the democratic congressional campaign committee , which has duffy and ribble on its 2012 target list , used the vote in its campaign to make the freshmen one-termers .	the dccc said in a statement that the vote presents duffy and ribble with a choice to " stand with big health insurance companies that have profited off discrimination and denying health care or stand with middle class families . "	in turn , the national republican congressional committee went after rep. ron kind , d-la crosse , saying he has " a chance to repeal the health-care boondoggle and replace it with a common-sense approach that will lower costs for middle-class families and small businesses .	will ron kind join the bipartisan effort or will he ignore his constituents and take another job-destroying vote ? "	with a 242-193 majority , republicans are likely to succeed in the house .	but the vote largely will be symbolic , as democrats are expected to thwart any repeal effort in the senate , where they hold a majority .	and if they ca n't , obama will likely veto any repeal bill that reaches his desk .	rep. tom petri , r-fond du lac , said it was critical for house republicans to vote on repeal regardless of how unlikely it seems the effort will prevail . "	it 's important for the house majority to state its position in the clearest possible terms to encourage a general re-evaluation of the new law , " petri said . "	we can better ensure access to coverage through reforms which reward high-quality , low-cost medical services instead of simply giving government more control over our health care . "

a police photographer , furious with a rolling stone magazine cover photo he says glamorizes the surviving boston marathon suspect , has released gritty images from the night dzhokhar tsarnaev was captured .	the photos released to boston magazine on thursday by massachusetts state police tactical photographer sgt. sean murphy show a bloody , disheveled tsarnaev with the red dot of a sniper 's rifle laser sight on his forehead .	murphy said in a statement to the magazine that tsarnaev is evil and his photos show the " real boston bomber , not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of rolling stone magazine . "	the music magazine hits the shelves this week , and some retailers have said they wo n't sell it .	the newly released photos were taken when tsarnaev was captured april 19 , bleeding and hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard .	the april 15 bombing near the finish line of the most famous marathon in the country killed three people and injured more than 260 .	a police officer was allegedly killed april 18 by tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , who died following a shootout with police later that evening .	dzhokhar tsarnaev , an ethnic chechen who came to the u.s. as a child , pleaded not guilty last week while appearing nonchalant , though his face was swollen and his arm was in a cast .	state police spokesman david procopio said in a statement that the agency did not authorize the release of the photos to boston magazine and will not release them to other media . "	the state police will have no further comment on this matter tonight , " he added .	boston magazine printed more than a dozen photos from the day tsarnaev was captured .	three of the images show tsarnaev as he emerged from the boat , head bowed , with red smudges and streaks on his clothing and the boat .	two images show the red dot of the laser sight in the middle of his forehead and just above his left eye .	the other show the dot on the top of his head as he buries his face in his arms .	boston magazine editor john wolfson later tweeted and reported on the magazine 's website that murphy was " relieved of duty " and had a hearing next week .	asked by the associated press about murphy 's job status , procopio said in an email that state police will conduct an internal investigation into murphy 's release of the photos .	murphy , who did not return a message from the ap , said in his statement to boston magazine that rolling stone 's cover photo , a softly-lit image of a brooding tsarnaev , insults officers killed in the line of duty , their colleagues and their families by glamorizing the " face of terror . " "	it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of rolling stone magazine , " he said .	rolling stone has said the cover story on tsarnaev was part of its " long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day . "	in his statement , murphy said the capture of tsarnaev played out like a television show , but he hopes his photos show it was " as real as it gets . " "	these were real people , with real lives , with real families , " murphy said . "	and to have this cover dropped into boston was hurtful to their memories and their families . "	he added : " there is nothing glamorous in bringing more pain to a grieving family . "

" "	tsarnaev should not be heard to complain about the receipt of information that he himself has requested and that the government had no legal obligation to provide earlier ( or at all ) , " prosecutors wrote .	tsarnaev 's lawyers argued in their motion filed on tuesday that a september trial date would be more realistic given the " extraordinary complexity and international dimensions " of the case .	two bombs at the finish line of the april 15 , 2013 boston marathon killed three people and injured more than 260 others .	tsarnaev 's older brother , tamerlan , died in a police shootout days after the bombing .	the court filing submitted by u.s. attorney carmen ortiz also dismissed concerns raised by the defense about the scope of witness and exhibit lists filed under seal last week .	the lists named more than 700 potential law enforcement and civilian witnesses and 1,238 exhibits .	most of the law enforcement witnesses were involved in the collection , photographing or chain of custody of evidence and some could be taken off the list , prosecutors said , if the defense agreed to accept their findings as fact .	the government also said it has made " a good-faith effort to identify each item on its exhibit list in an understandable manner and stood ready to help the defense identify any item on the list that they could not identify on their own , " the filing said .	prosecutors did concede that they inadvertently failed to email the defense an index of additional materials it provided dec. 15-18 , but noted it did so as soon as the defense asked for the index .	was not immediately known when u.s. district court judge george o'toole jr. might rule on the motion to delay the trial .	he also is considering a defense motion filed earlier in the week to move the trial out of massachusetts .	this past september , o'toole denied earlier motions to move the case or delay it to september 2015 , though he did agree to a roughly two-month delay from the original nov. 3 trial date .

but the $ 27 million jail sat empty for seven years with no contract to fill its cells , according to the billings gazette ( http://bit.ly/1jyqq2v ) .	state officials opted not to house inmates there and the montana attorney general initially said the jail could n't hold out-of-state inmates either .	a helena district court judge later overturned the attorney general 's opinion .	new management and a federal contract came in late 2014 , and the jail had as many as 250 inmates at its peak .	but the contract collapsed and the population had dwindled to nine by november 2015 .	two rivers authority is the town 's economic development organization that owns the jail .	according to the group , the jail needs 200 to 250 inmates to break even .	for it to be profitable and pay down debt , the jail would need at least 350 inmates .	jeff mcdowell , the authority 's executive director , says the jail 's debt is roughly $ 40 million .

dolphins living in one of the areas worst hit by the gulf of mexico oil spill were in bad shape a year later , with lung problems consistent with exposure to oil , according to a study assessing damage from the spill .	government , academic and other researchers made comprehensive check-ups on 29 dolphins in barataria bay in august 2011 as part of the natural resource damage assessment ?	a federal process to determine both the extent of damage and how to repair it .	barataria bay was one of the areas where pelicans struggled in heavy slicks and thick globs of oil washed onto marshy islands between april and july 2010 .	fourteen of the 29 dolphins examined in 2011 were in guarded , poor or grave condition .	that compared to one out of 15 caught for comparison in sarasota bay , florida , which was not involved in the spill , according to the study published wednesday in the american chemical society journal environmental science & technology .	national oceanic and atmospheric administration scientist lori schwacke said she has made similar assessments in other groups of dolphins , sometimes in response to large numbers of deaths .	the study indicates a possible link to the oil spill but does not prove one , said mobi solangi , director of the institute for marine mammal studies in gulfport , mississippi . "	i think it 's an important study .	it 's an important first step , " said solangi , who was not involved in the study .	he said shortcomings include lack of pre-spill data on dolphins in the bay , which has a history of pollution from industry , sewage and agricultural runoff carried by the mississippi river .	it also lacks comparison with the florida dolphins , which probably spend more time in deep water than the pods found in barataria bay .	a statement from bp plc said the company , " has been funding noaa 's work on this subject for over three years and requesting data throughout this period .	the agency still has not provided bp with any data demonstrating that the alleged poor health of any dolphins was caused by oil exposure .	indeed , noaa has not even provided bp an injury assessment on dolphins or any other species or habitat . "	schwacke said bp was given all of the data used in the paper .	a bp representative was with the group that captured and released the dolphins , said teri rowles , coordinator of the noaa marine mammal health and stranding response program and a co-author of the study .	the scientists said moderate to severe lung disease was five times more likely in the louisiana dolphins than the florida group .	noaa said dolphins were checked again this year in barataria and sarasota bays , and in mississippi and alabama waters of the mississippi sound .	data from those four groups is still being analyzed .
oil jumped above $ 86 a barrel thursday as the dollar weakened after the federal reserve said it will buy $ 600 billion dollars of treasury bonds to stimulate the u.s. economy .	benchmark crude for december delivery rose $ 1.69 to $ 86.38 a barrel in thursday afternoon trading on the new york mercantile exchange .	the announcement was n't a surprise for markets but it underlined expectations that the dollar would weaken further and push up prices for commodities including oil .	the strength of the dollar and the price of oil are closely linked .	the dollar has been getting weaker against other currencies for weeks , ahead of the fed decision and will probably fall further as more dollars pour into the economy .	oil is priced in dollars and becomes cheaper for holders of foreign currency when the dollar falls .	europeans , for example , get more dollars for their euros and can buy more oil for fewer euros .	since oil is cheaper for them , they buy more , sending up the dollar price of oil .	energy traders expect this to happen , so they buy oil when the dollar falls , boosting the effect .	when the dollar weakens , investors would rather hold hard assets like oil and other commodities because hard assets protect them against more weakening and inflation . "	effectively , what the fed did yesterday was impose a new tax on ( u.s. ) consumers , " cameron hanover analyst peter beutel said , noting that gasoline prices are going up .	oil prices hit a high for the year of $ 87.15 a barrel during intraday trading in early may .	in other nymex trading in december contracts on thursday , heating oil added 4.40 cents at $ 2.3719 a gallon , gasoline gained 3.64 cents to $ 2.1744 a gallon and natural gas fell 5 cents to $ 3.786 per 1,000 cubic feet .	in london , brent crude climbed $ 1.55 to $ 87.93 a barrel on the ice futures exchange .

a federal appeals court wednesday ordered damages to be increased for two iowa women who were strip-searched after being arrested for protesting at a rally for president george bush in 2004 .	alice mccabe and christine nelson were arrested during the event in cedar rapids and taken to the linn county jail where they were strip-searched and subjected to body cavity searches , court records show .	they filed lawsuits against the female jailer who conducted the searches , claiming their constitutional rights had been violated .	the case went to trial and a jury awarded them $ 750,000 in damages ?	$ 500,000 for nelson and $ 250,000 for mccabe .	u.s. district court judge linda reade threw out the damages , ruling they were excessive .	reade offered the women a combined $ 75,000 but they rejected the offer and opted for a second trial instead .	that trial ended in a jury awarding them less than $ 60,000 .	the u.s. 8th circuit court of appeals in st. louis ruled the amount offered by reade was miscalculated and ordered the case back to federal district court to increase the damages or for a third trial .	in its ruling , the court said the judge used a comparison of judgments in similar cases to reach the $ 75,000 amount but failed to take into account the effect of inflation .	the court said the judge relied on a 1978 case in reaching the amount that was offered . "	an award of $ 75,000 in 1978 dollars amounts to significantly more when adjusted for inflation to 2004 dollars , " the court said .	that mistake " amounts to an abuse of discretion , and require us to remand this case to calculate the amount ... for both women , " the court said .	while ruling the damage amount should be increased , the court ruled against the women 's claims that federal agents lacked probable cause when they were arrested .	david o'brien , the attorney for mccabe and nelson , called the ruling " bittersweet .

a san francisco hedge fund founder was convicted of insider trading charges monday by a jury that rejected his claims that he was careful never to trade based on secrets he received about public companies .	doug whitman , whose hedge fund oversaw roughly $ 100 million , was convicted of all charges against him .	only days earlier , the manhattan federal jury heard him testify that he took pains to trade only on legal information gleaned from employees at public companies and from analysts .	whitman , the 54-year-old founder of whitman capital , was the only defendant to testify among dozens charged in a wide ranging crackdown since 2007 on insider trading by federal authorities .	nearly all of those charged have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial .	sentencing was set for dec. 20 . "	douglas whitman now joins the grim procession of convicted wall street professionals who decided that the rules do n't apply to them .	the rules do apply , " u.s. attorney preet bharara said in a statement issued after the verdict . "	mr. whitman had a hedge fund with his name on the door , with rules against insider trading .	he flouted those rules , tarnished his name and now is a convicted felon facing imprisonment . "	whitman 's defense team declined to comment after the verdict .	prosecutors said whitman made nearly $ 1 million between 2006 and 2009 by receiving inside tips about the earnings of public companies .	he testified that he was careful not to make trades based on inside information whenever he came across it , but his definition of what constituted secrets seemed elusive .	whitman said he believed it was fair for public company employees to give traders general information or " color " about how business was going , as long as they did n't give up exact numbers about revenue , profits and guidance before they were released publicly .	over three weeks , jurors heard testimony that whitman 's hedge fund made trades from 2007 to 2009 based on inside information related to google inc. , marvell technology group ltd. and polycom inc. .	among witnesses for the government was roomy khan , of fort lauderdale , florida , who once lived near whitman in atherton , california .	she said he was " almost hounding me " for inside information from a close contact at polycom , a telecommunications company .	whitman testified his firm realized $ 362,172 in profits on polycom shares during the period the government alleged khan gave him secrets .	the government played audio tapes for jurors of phone conversations between khan and whitman .	in one recorded call , whitman refers to khan as " miss google " after he made roughly a half-million dollars on tips the government said he got from khan .	whitman was convicted of two counts of securities fraud and two additional counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud .	the charges carry a potential penalty of up to 50 years in prison , but his sentence will likely be much less .	so far , the longest prison sentence to result from the manhattan probe was 11 years given to raj rajaratnam , a one-time billionaire and manhattan hedge fund founder who prosecutors say made as much as $ 75 million trading illegally .

a male contestant on a new vh1 dating show did n't beckon a woman to walk in front of him out of politeness .	he wanted to check her out from behind , and did n't need to use his imagination .	the " dating naked " series is the latest example of reality television 's newest trend .	nudity is hot , no longer confined to late-night premium cable .	leading the way is discovery 's " naked and afraid , " where a man and woman who do n't know each other fend for themselves in the wilderness for three weeks without a stitch between them .	that program 's success since its june 2013 premiere begat vh1 's " dating naked " and tlc 's real estate show , " buying naked , " with more in the planning stages .	what 's the appeal ?	well , what do you think ?	in a world of endless choices , titillation lures .	so does a catchy title , and the word " naked " jumps off the program guide .	brent montgomery , who produces the nonfiction hit " pawn stars " that airs on the history channel , said many early fans were drawn in by that title even though the show had nothing to do with the image left in your head .	he 's now doing the spinoff , " pawnography . "	to truly succeed , however , a show needs more going for it to keep viewers once the novelty of watching naked bodies with blurred body parts wears off . "	the secret sauce of our show is not the fact that they 're naked , " said denise contis , west coast head of production and development at discovery . "	i think it 's the storytelling , the cast and a survival experience that 's authentic . "	memorable characters make successful shows , " and it takes a big character to take off their clothes in front of a reality tv camera , " montgomery said .	standards are the same at each show : male and female genitalia are blurred out , along with female breasts .	backsides are fair game .	a graphic artist takes about a week to cleanse each episode of " naked and afraid . "	a strategically placed flowerpot or sofa obscures the nude home shoppers in " buying naked . "	discovery was n't searching for a " naked " show when developing " naked and afraid , " contis said .	it wanted a new twist in the survival genre and , ultimately , the most elemental shelter is clothing .	yet , let 's face it : one hook is the question of whether a romance develops between two naked strangers left alone in the woods ( except for the producers and camera crew , of course ) .	it has n't happened yet .	the opposite is more likely ; in one upcoming episode the two survivalists detest each other so much they agreed to separate until they were picked up at the end .	romance is the point of " dating naked . "	susan levison , head of programming at vh1 , gave the series a green light her first day on the job last september , and hurried to beat competitors to the air .	fox has its own naked dating show in the works , but put it on hold during a management change . "	the idea of using nudity as a metaphor for allowing yourself to be truly exposed and truly yourself in the search for love felt really fresh and exciting , " levison said .	while the nudity arguably serves a thematic purpose on " dating naked " and " naked and afraid , " it 's hard to see " buying naked " as anything other than a typical real estate show where prospective owners leave their clothes at home .	tlc says the florida-based show exposes the habits of a nearby nudist colony .	the " dating naked " debut earlier this month featured a woman in her 30s stung when her chosen man was distracted by a younger , gorgeous temptress ?	an intriguing story for vh1 's female-dominated audience .	the older woman 's name , wee wee , trended on twitter and the episode 's audience of 826,000 easily beat the network 's average of 335,000 viewers in the time slot .	with more than 4 million viewers , " naked and afraid " was discovery 's most-watched series premiere ever .	that explains why plenty of other " naked " pitches are being heard in network boardrooms . "	you 'll probably see four or five work and a dozen that do n't work , " montgomery said .	the parents television council is dismayed that each of the " naked " shows is judged by its network as being suitable for children .	but tim winter , president of the lobbying group that backs family friendly programming , predicted the trend will be short-lived .	despite the ratings , the shows likely make many advertisers squeamish .

economists are projecting a slight decrease in state revenue during the two-year budget cycle that began last month .	oregon 's office of economic analysis said wednesday it expects the general fund to collect about $ 40 million less than the previous estimate , made in may .	that 's because the state owed more than expected in corporate and personal income tax refunds .	the change means corporate income tax collections wo n't trigger " kicker " rebates , which are paid when income tax collections during a two-year budget cycle exceed projections by at least 2 percent .	the slight downturn in the forecast is unlikely to require any immediate changes to the state budget .

jessica kisby and craig arno were no criminal masterminds , according to the prosecutor trying to put both in prison for carjacking and killing an atlantic city casino patron two years ago . "	they were more like evil pinballs , bouncing this way and that , inflicting pain , " james mcclain , atlantic county 's first assistant prosecutor , said thursday in closing arguments in arno 's murder trial . "	they were like pinballs , bouncing from one thing to the next , never really planning . "	that was clearly the case on the evening of may 21 , 2010 , he said , when the two headed out from the condo they shared near the beach and drove toward the casinos .	they spotted a gleaming white lincoln suv driven by martin caballero , 47 , of north bergen , followed him into the parking garage of the trump taj mahal casino resort , and carjacked him , mcclain said .	they drove him to a rural area in western atlantic county , where arno stabbed him to death with kisby 's help , dragged his body into the bushes , the prosecutor said .	he also set the suv ablaze to try to hide their crimes and used his atm card to withdraw money from his bank account , mcclain said .	kisby pleaded guilty to murdering caballero and agreed to testify against arno in return for becoming eligible for parole after 30 years .	arno denies any role in the carjacking or murder .	he does admit he torched caballero 's vehicle after his then-girlfriend showed up late one night with it , saying she had " a problem " and needed his help in getting rid of it .	indeed , arno 's public defender , eric shenkus , took the unusual step of trying to help the jury fill out its verdict checklist ahead of time . "	there are some counts here that you should absolutely check off ' guilty , ' without a doubt , " he said . "	count 14 , aggravated arson : check it off ' guilty . '	mr. arno admitted it on the stand .	count 15 , tampering with evidence ?	blatantly .	guilty .	theft of the minivan ?	guilty . "	( the pair stole a minivan from their condo garage to try to flee atlantic city days after the killing . )	but on the most serious charges , shenkus said , arno is innocent .	he said the most overwhelming evidence points to kisby ; arno testified she must have been aided by a mysterious " other guy " she was driving around with that night in carrying out the carjacking and killing .	shenkus used kisby 's testimony monday as a way to turn the jury against her , citing her flippant , remorseless performance on the witness stand , during which she laughed , giggled , yawned , stretched and matter-of-factly described a two-part knife assault on caballero that led to his slow death . "	i do n't think anyone could have imagined the display she put on here , " shenkus said . "	the utter lack of shame that she displayed is simply atrocious . "	mcclain did not dispute that account of kisby 's testimony , and indeed used it to make his own point : that kisby " is out for herself . "	because of that , he told the jury , she had every incentive in the world to blame the shady third-party arno suggested was her true partner in crime . "	if that third person existed , she would have given him up in a heartbeat , " mcclain said . "	that 's what you can count on with jessica kisby . "	then mcclain tried to transfer what he hoped would be the jury 's disgust with kisby onto arno , who , he noted , was naked in bed with her in a cheap motel when they both were arrested .	the prosecutor said they remained a couple even though arno was upset that she was running around with " some guy " other than him . "	jessica kisby is a cold-hearted , cold-blooded killer , " he said . "	when she testified , she was only one of two cold-hearted , cold-blooded killers in the room .	they were a matched set , two of them . "	shenkus disagreed , saying prosecutors produced no forensic evidence linking arno to the carjacking or murder .	a bank surveillance video taken shortly after the murder shows arno with clean hands , arms and clothes ?	not what one would expect from someone who had just carried out a gruesome knife slaying that broke the first knife that was used . "	look at those fingernails , " shenkus told the jury as a video frame showed arno 's hand reaching toward the atm machine to make a withdrawal ?	allegedly with caballero 's stolen card . "	does that look like a man who just 20 minutes earlier had engaged in a brutal and bloody attack ?	there was no time to clean up .	those are the hands of a man that is telling the truth . "	but mcclain pointed to a different surveillance video which he said clearly shows a cut between two of arno 's fingers .	the judge was to read three-hours of legal instructions to the jury thursday afternoon .	jury deliberations were expected to begin friday .
south carolina legislators will put $ 1 million into cleaning up methamphetamine labs after the federal government stopped paying states for the work .	the state senate on tuesday agreed to use $ 1 million in surplus state cash to cover the cleanup programs .	meth labs create toxic waste that ca n't easily be disposed of .	each site can cost up to $ 3,500 .	the drug enforcement administration last year gave the state about $ 727,000 for cleanup work , but those funds expired and sheriffs have been using contingency funds and forfeited drug money for cleanups since february .	state sen. mike fair of greenville said that without the state cash , local law enforcement agencies would be responsible for covering the costs .

more than 200 sage grouse could be shipped from montana to alberta over the next four years , under a cross-border proposal announced tuesday that officials hope will stave off the bird 's extermination in the canadian province .	sage grouse ?	large , ground-dwelling birds known for their spectacular mating displays ?	have been in decline for decades across western north america .	the main cause has been the conversion of sage brush steppes for grazing and crop production .	in alberta , a recent boom in oil and gas drilling has pushed into one of the bird 's last strongholds in the province , near the borders of montana and saskatchewan .	officials say disruptions to sage grouse breeding areas has driven down their population to fewer than 100 birds across an area of roughly 1,500 square miles .	to supplement that population while habitat restoration work gets under way , montana wildlife officials want to ship an initial batch of 40 sage grouse to alberta next spring .	if that first group of birds thrives , 60 more sage grouse could be shipped north annually in the following three years . "	our idea is to maintain the birds long enough on the landscape so that they can benefit from the efforts to turn the habitat around for them , " said dale eslinger , senior wildlife biologist with alberta sustainable resource development .	the proposal appears to mark the first time wildlife has been shipped from northeastern montana to augment a struggling canadian population , said mark sullivan , wildlife program manager for montana fish , wildlife and parks .	canada in the mid-1990s provided 66 gray wolves for relocation to idaho and wyoming , part of a successful program to restore the species to the u.s. northern rockies . "	it 's really rare to move animals across international boundaries like that , " sullivan said .	sage grouse are classified as endangered in canada .	u.s. interior department officials announced in march that more protections for sage grouse were warranted for 11 western states , after environmental groups lobbied for the species to be listed as threatened or endangered .	but the government said listing the species was precluded because others were in greater need of protection .	despite the federal government 's finding , sullivan said the relocation of some montana birds to canada would not harm the overall population . "	with the number of birds we have in phillips and valley counties ?	more than 15,000 ?	it 's not going to hurt to try it , " he said . "	if they do blink out , if they essentially go extinct in alberta , then it would be much harder to start up a population . "	an environmental study covering the first phase of the sage grouse relocation plan was released tuesday .	montana fish , wildlife and parks commissioners were set to vote on the proposal feb. 10 .	future relocations would require a second study , sullivan said .
the alleged ringleader of a scheme federal prosecutors say siphoned at least $ 5 million from thousands bank accounts by installing skimming devices in cash machines was formally charged friday in new jersey following his extradition from europe .	romanian national marius vintila appeared in u.s. district court in newark , n.j. , on six charges including bank fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft .	the 31-year-old from galati , romania , was arrested sept. 24 in sweden and extradited to new jersey where some of the alleged thefts took place .	prosecutors say bank customers in new york , connecticut and florida were also affected .	vintila fled to europe following the arrests in july of several of his 12 alleged co-conspirators , according to the u.s. attorney 's office for the district of new jersey .	prosecutors say many of the co-conspirators are also romanian nationals who live in and around the new york city borough of queens .	vintila , who frequently operated under the alias dan girneata , allegedly oversaw an operation that stole banking and credit card information from thousands of bank customers through building and installing devices in atms to " skim " customer account information , according to court papers .	prosecutors say the ring also installed pinhole cameras in bank vestibules to record atm users ' keystrokes in order to decipher personal identification numbers .	prosecutors say vintila then worked with his co-conspirators to create fake bank cards using the stolen information , and used the cards to withdraw money from customer accounts .	the u.s. attorney 's office estimates that $ 3 million was stolen from wells fargo bank , and $ 1 million each from citibank and td bank .	other unnamed financial institutions were also affected .	vintila appeared in jeans and a white t-shirt on friday , and was shackled around the waist .	he answered a judge 's questions through a romanian translator .	his court-appointed attorney , christopher d. adams , said his client had no criminal record , would fight the charges , and planned to plead not guilty to all six counts .	u.s. magistrate madeline cox arleo ordered vintila to remain in federal custody .	she set a hearing date for feb. 17 .

a sheriff seeking the gop nomination for an arizona congressional seat was forced to confirm he is gay saturday and resigned from presidential hopeful mitt romney 's arizona committee amid allegations of misconduct made by a man with whom he previously had a relationship .	pinal county sheriff paul babeu denied claims he tried to threaten the man , a mexican immigrant and a former campaign volunteer , with deportation if their past relationship was made public .	the man 's allegations were first published friday in the new times , a phoenix alternative weekly magazine .	babeu , a first-term sheriff who has risen to national prominence with his strong opposition to illegal immigration and smuggling , said the accusations were an attempt to hurt his political career .	he vowed to continue his campaign in arizona 's rural western 4th congressional district seat , but said he had called presidential candidate mitt romney 's staff to say he would step down from his post as state campaign co-chair . "	this whole rumor , this whole of idea of who i am in my private life has been shopped around , " babeu told reporters during an hour-long press conference saturday in front of his sheriff 's office . "	this was a way , the hook , of how this could be brought out , and to malign and attack a sheriff who does stand for conservative principals , who does enforce the law . "	the lawyer for the man , melissa weiss-riner , did not returns calls or emails from the associated press on saturday , but told the new times that babeu 's attorney and campaign consultant falsely told her client that his visa had expired .	babeu told reporters he believed the man , identified only by his first name jose , was living in the country legally .	the new times posted a photo provided by the man of the two embracing .	it also posted a cellphone self-portrait of a smiling babeu in his underwear and another of what appears to be the shirtless sheriff in a bathroom , posted on a gay dating website .	the man provided the magazine with photos of himself and babeu and text messages between the two .	babeu did n't deny their authenticity .	the huge congressional district where babeu is seeking election runs from western arizona all the way to the desert south of phoenix .	its voters are heavily republican and generally very conservative .	babeu issued a sweeping denial of any wrongdoing in front of his headquarters .	the press conference was attended by about three dozen high-ranking uniformed deputies , local elected officials and citizens . "	i 'm here to say that all the allegations that were in the story were untrue ?	except for the instance that refers to me as gay , " babeu said . "	that 's the truth ?	i am gay . "	he said he did n't have the power as a local sheriff to get anyone deported .	babeu , who is not married , said he had been in a relationship with jose that ended sometime before september .	jose also ran his campaign website and twitter account , and babeu said he began posting derogatory items on the sites after their breakup .	babeu said he had his lawyer contact jose and demand that he stop and turn over passwords allowing access to the sites .	babeu said the postings and actions amounted to identity theft but that he chose to deal with the matter privately through his lawyer .	it 's was n't immediately clear if babeu 's admission would hurt him politically , but his primary opponents came out swinging .	babeu is taking on an incumbent tea party republican who switched districts , u.s. rep. paul gosar , and state sen. ron gould , a conservative from northwestern arizona , in august 's 4th district primary .	gould said he believed babeu 's posting of pictures on what the lawmaker called a " homosexual hookup website " were a " congressman weiner type of moment . " "	the real issue here is the poor judgment of a government official , posting those kinds of photos on a public website , " gould said . "	i think that shows a lack of good judgment . "	he also said he believes babeu 's sexual orientation would hurt him in the district .	gould sponsored arizona constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman , an amendment he said drew extremely strong support in the rural counties he and babeu seek to represent . "	this is about an abuse of power , a misuse of public trust , bad judgment and the continued use of official resources for personal and political gain , " gosar said in a statement that noted the location of the press conference and the large gathering of uniformed sheriff 's personnel at the event .	babeu said he has never defined himself based on his ethnicity or sexual orientation , and he would continue to focus on unemployment and the federal deficit in his campaign . "	what i 'm trying to do is ( be ) as forthright as possible , talking about deeply personal , private matters , and trying to be upfront , " babeu said . "	the disclosure of that information is something that i feel no american should have to do . "	babeu acknowledged that he has sent and posted the photos , but said they were personal .	when asked if posting such pictures on a public website showed poor judgment for a public official , he reiterated that he believed they were personal .	babeu had just a few years of experience in law enforcement when he ousted an incumbent sheriff in 2008 and took over as chief of the 700-person department responsible for law enforcement and the county jail .	two decades earlier he was the youngest councilman ever elected in north adams , mass. , and he went on to fail in two bids for mayor there .	he was the first republican in memory to win countywide in pinal , and he quickly raised the profile of his agency by joining the circuit of vocal arizona border hawks .	babeu 's rise has n't been without stumbles .	he was forced to apologize for appearing on a radio show that endorses racist ideologies .	he said his staff did n't do enough research about the show .	babeu owes much of his political standing to arizona sen. john mccain , who enlisted babeu in 2010 to appear in two key television ads touting mccain 's border security plan , including a much-lampooned spot in which mccain turns to babeu and says " complete the danged fence . "	recently , he 's called for attorney general eric holder to resign over a failed gun investigation called operation fast and furious that allowed hundreds of guns into mexico .

the blue-and-white banner exclaiming " anticipation " on the front of central falls high school seems like a cruel joke for an institution so chronically troubled that its leaders decided to fire every teacher by year 's end .	no more than half those instructors would be hired back under a federal option that has enraged the state 's powerful teachers union , earned criticism from students , and brought praise from u.s. education secretary arne duncan and some parents .	the mass firings were approved by the school district 's board of trustees tuesday night after talks failed between superintendent frances gallo and the local teachers union over implementing changes , including offering more tutoring and a longer school day .	the teachers say they want more pay for the additional work . "	if it 's only an hour or two a week , i think teachers can afford to do that , " said robert rivera , 40 , who worries about sending his 13-year-old daughter to the troubled high school next year .	he dropped out of school as a teenager and works more than 60 hours a week as an appliance repairman .	he 's determined his daughter will go to college , although he sometimes feels her teachers have a nonchalant attitude when he seeks help . "	i just feel like maybe they 're not putting in the effort , " he said .	the shake-up comes as rhode island 's new education commissioner , deborah gist , pushes the state to compete for millions of dollars in federal funding to reform the worst 5 percent of its schools , including in central falls .	state law requires schools to warn teachers by march 1 if their jobs are in jeopardy for the following school year .	to get the money , schools must choose one of four paths set under federal law , including mass firings .	gallo has said she initially hoped to avoid layoffs by adopting a plan that would have lengthened the school day and required teachers to get additional training and offer more tutoring .	u.s. secretary of education arne duncan applauded the plan , saying students only have one chance for an education . "	when schools continue to struggle we have a collective obligation to take action , " he said in a written statement .	the u.s. department of education does not play a role in deciding which model schools choose and did not know wednesday whether central falls was the first to opt to get rid of its teachers , said sandra abrevaya , a department spokeswoman .	the decision won praise from republican gov. don carcieri , a former math teacher who supports gist . "	we can no longer stand by as our schools underperform , " carcieri said in a written statement . "	while we have some excellent individual teachers , our students continue to be held back by a lack of a quality education and by union leadership that puts their self-interests above the interests of the students . "	the school board decision came after a rally tuesday of more than 500 union members and teacher supporters .	the american federation of teachers also sent a representative with a message of support from the union 's 1.4 million members , the providence journal reported .	leaders from the local teachers union did not respond to repeated requests for comment wednesday .	but in a news release issued earlier in the week , jane sessums , president of the central falls teachers union , said teachers had already agreed to several reforms , including teacher evaluations and schedule changes , and said the administration was scapegoating teachers .	aft president randi weingarten said in a statement wednesday that improvements made in the last two years have been overlooked " in the rush to make judgments and cast blame . "	weingarten said reading scores , for example , have risen by 21 percent . "	we are disappointed that u.s. education secretary arne duncan did n't get all the facts ?	or even speak with teachers ?	before weighing in on the mass firing at central falls high school , " weingarten added .	central falls high school has long been one of the worst-performing in rhode island .	just 7 percent of 11th graders tested in the fall were proficient in math .	only 33 percent were proficient in writing , and just 55 percent were proficient in reading .	in 2008 , just 52 percent of students graduated within four years and 30 percent dropped out .	more children live in poverty in central falls , a city of just 1 square mile , than anywhere else in rhode island .	until recently , one of the city 's few growth industries was a quasi-public jail .	shantel joseph , 42 , who lives just a block from the high school , was uncertain when asked whether her 16-year-old son would graduate . "	he might , " she said , noting that he earns mostly cs and ds on his report card and appears to be assigned little homework .	still , she opposed mass firings in a city where unemployment stands at 13.8 percent . "	it 's a bad idea , because i know they need a job , " said joseph , a part-time worker who is seeking more hours . "	they need to work .	maybe they should talk to the teachers . "	during a rainstorm wednesday , four boys sprinted from a side door on the high school , then ran down a driveway .	one of them , christian manco , 15 , said there was a walkout of students in support of their teachers . "	honestly , it 's not a good idea , " he said . "	the school wants them to work more hours for no extra pay . "	his friend , patrick shirt , 15 , stuck up for the school ?	especially after he advanced from freshman to sophomore year despite having switched schools and dropped out for a portion of the year . "	i felt kind of happy because i did n't have to go to summer school , " he said . "	they still passed me . "	negotiations bogged down when officials for the teachers ' union asked for more pay if they were going to be doing more work at the school .	it remains unclear whether a compromise might emerge , and a phone message left with gallo was not returned .	gist , the education commissioner , said wednesday that it 's not a negotiation , and that she 's awaiting more detailed plans from the superintendent .	she doubts the superintendent will consider another path and said rhode island can not tolerate a school at which less than half of students graduate . "	those are just numbers that are not sustainable for a community , " gist said . "	in today 's economy , young people who are leaving high school without a diploma are going to struggle throughout their life . "

the program , called recruit new york , marks the beginning of volunteer week 2011 , a nationwide effort to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers in the country and to encourage more people to volunteer as well .	with the number of volunteer emergency workers constantly dwindling in new york , david jacobowitz , president of the firemen 's association of the state of new york , said that not only do they save lives , but they save money too . "	volunteer firefighters and ems personnel do important and challenging work for the pure satisfaction of helping others , " jacobowitz said . "	they are essential for a number of reasons , including the fact that volunteers live in the communities in which they serve , which greatly enhances response times , and their volunteer service saves taxpayers millions of dollars every year . "	there are roughly 97,000 volunteer firefighters in new york , making up about 95 percent of all state firefighters .	the state also has over 57,000 emergency medical service providers .	recruit new york , led by fasny , is the result of the collaboration of several fire-related organizations including the firemen 's association of the state of new york , the new york state association of fire chiefs , the association of fire districts of new york state , volunteer fire police association of the state of new york and county fire coordinators association of the state of new york .	this is the first time all of these organizations have collaborated together on a single project .	a bill backed by assembly republicans was introduced in february that would provide incentives in the form of tax breaks for volunteer firefighters and ambulance workers . "	unfortunately , volunteer recruitment in new york state is on the decline , " assembly minority leader brian kolb , r-canandaigua , ontario county , said .

the university of south carolina sought an additional $ 5 million wednesday for an expanded summer session that redefines the school year as three full semesters .	university president harris pastides told a house budget-writing panel that the " on your time graduation " initiative would allow students to earn a college degree in three years for less money , since tuition rates for the summer program would be lower . "	it 's shaking up the calendar , " he said . "	it expands opportunities to either accelerate or take a fall off to do an internship and make up credits in the summer . "	the initiative would create a 12-week summer semester , in addition to the 15-week fall and spring semesters .	currently , the college offers two one-month summer sessions , as well as a three-week session in may .	but those course offerings are limited . "	we want to do something extraordinary and offer required core courses as well , " pastides said .	under the new initiative , students could take a full , 15-credit course load over the summer , while the shorter courses would still be available for those who may want to more quickly earn a few credits .	the additional money is needed to compensate professors for the additional work and to keep buildings open , pastides said . "	if this happens , there will be a new buzz in the summertime .	it would become more of a year-round campus , " he said .	the university is also seeking a repeat of the full $ 5 million it received in the current budget to launch an online initiative this fall .	usc 's palmetto college offers residents with at least two years of classroom credits as a way to complete a bachelor 's degree at home .	initial degrees offered include business , criminal justice , education and nursing .	pastides wants the $ 5 million to become an annual budget item , saying the money is needed to expand the courses converted into an online format , and to redevelop that format for each course every few years as technology changes .	the idea accomplishes two goals .	palmetto college expands access to higher education in a state where fewer than one in four adults hold a bachelor 's degree , hopefully boosting residents ' wages .	it provides the public university a new revenue source in an era when money designated in the state budget makes up less than 10 percent of its budget .	legislators praised the university for taking an innovative approach .	pastides also sought a total of $ 22.3 million in one-time money for deferred maintenance at the university 's eight campuses , with more than two-thirds of that for the main campus in columbia .
a mixed bag of statistics released in recent weeks suggests that kansas , like the rest of the nation , is finding it difficult to get its economic engine firing on all cylinders .	despite rising state revenues , job growth remains flat while more residents are seeking public assistance .	for the first time since the summer of 2009 , the kansas jobless rate increased , rising to 6.7 percent from 6.5 percent in august .	this occurred despite an increase in state revenues in august , a fifth-straight monthly increase .	first-term republican gov. sam brownback said even with the monthly fluctuations , he believes kansas manufacturing , agriculture and energy sectors are " bucking national trends " as the economy recovers . "	i feel like this is bit of a warren buffett-type strategy , where you 're looking at something that has long-term value , not looking quarter to quarter , " brownback said . "	people are going to eat .	people are going to use energy . "	in the coming weeks , the governor 's staff will be announcing proposals to cut taxes and repeal regulations ?	part of his economic agenda since the 2010 campaign .	he wants to create jobs for the nearly 100,000 residents in the state who are unemployed , reduce the number of children living in poverty and raise the median household income . "	if we can get that marginal tax rate down , then people will change their actions , " brownback said .	democrats argue that the state 's lack of economic momentum is a reflection of republicans focusing more on social issues , such as abortion restrictions and eliminating arts funding , than creating jobs . "	these unemployment numbers show that job creation is n't even close to being ( brownback 's ) first priority , " said senate democratic leader anthony hensley of topeka .	despite the august unemployment increase statewide , areas of kansas are seeing improvement .	a comparison of the august numbers to the five - and 10-year averages finds that a number of rural counties are within a half-percent of the historic numbers , suggesting improving conditions .	the brownback administration said the situation is a bit deceiving .	because the rural counties have relatively stable workforces linked to agricultural production , there is little movement in the jobless rate up or down .	creating more economic opportunities may create the potential for a more volatile job market , but the governor also sees his rural opportunity zones program as a way to pump potential in areas that have lost population steadily for decades .	brownback said previous efforts to help rural counties have found little success .	they include hiring additional staff at the state level or at a university to teach people to do something to create jobs . "	the concept that has worked is if you provide an opportunity in a rural area , " he said , such as the homestead act that gave people 160 acres to settle and make their living . "	it was widely successful . "	university of kansas economist art hall told a gathering of economic advisers this past week that kansas was and would continue to see increased density around urban areas , such as johnson county and wichita .	hall said economic policies should strive to help raise the fortunes of the more than two dozen such regional hubs .	four southeast kansas senators are asking that their 17-county region , beset by an average unemployment rate of more than 7 percent , be given extra attention .	the governor 's staff is compiling information , including how kansas compares to missouri and oklahoma . "	we 're really trying to dig into the data to get some operating theories about what is taking place in this region , " brownback said . "	we have n't gotten anything to stick .	there has n't been anything organically there to grow . "	sen. pat apple , a louisburg republican , said policymakers and community leaders need to get an understanding of the region 's dynamics and find a long-term solution , not just give short-term attention to symptoms . "	if we can get people to see this as a regional effort , that if one town succeeds all succeed , it will be time well spent , " apple said , adding that it may be a multi-year process .	the lack of jobs is n't the only issue .	the u.s. census bureau released new figures showing one in seven kansas residents living below the poverty line , with more than 12 percent of residents lacking health insurance .	the figures are supported by state social and rehabilitation services reports showing more kansans needing assistance to put meals on the table .	according to srs statistics , the number of kansas residents participating in the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program , formerly known as food stamps , increased by 14.2 percent in fiscal year 2011 ending june 30 compared to the previous year .	there were on average 296,542 kansas residents receiving assistance in 2011 , a trend that is continuing in the first two months of new fiscal year that began july 1 . "	the increasing numbers of people applying for food stamps and other kinds of help is alarming , " srs secretary rob siedlecki said . "	this is a result of the past 2 ?	years of failed economic policies on the national level , and people are hurting . "	we are in a serious situation in this country and i hope congress can come up with realistic , effective ways to get the economy kick-started . "	siedlecki on friday announced a series of reforms to the assistance programs aimed at helping recipients find employment and reducing the amount of time they spend on social service rolls . "	helping people find jobs is our first priority , " siedlecki said .

one justice says the kansas supreme court is making it so difficult for criminal defendants to get their trials moved that nothing short of an angry mob outside a courthouse will force a change .	justice lee johnson leveled the criticism friday in a separate opinion in the capital murder cases of jonathan and reginald carr .	the court overturned their death sentences for a crime spree that left four people dead in a wichita field in december 2000 .	but the court rejected the men 's claims that they should be tried again outside wichita on all of the dozens of charges against them because of negative pretrial publicity .	johnson wrote that under the decision , a change of venue wo n't happen without a mob " storming the courthouse " with torches and a hangman 's rope .
missouri lawmakers sent the governor a $ 24 billion budget plan thursday that shores up funding for veterans homes , gives raises to a reduced state workforce and spares public schools and universities from cuts ?	a result legislators praised as an accomplishment in what they bemoaned as another tight budget year .	yet the budget also could be cast as a bit of a gamble .	to balance , it depends on a surge of money from the missouri lottery , which has yet to say how it will generate the cash .	the budget leaves little money left over in case revenue projections miss their mark .	and gov. jay nixon 's office already has indicated that he intends to ignore a section that seeks to impose eligibility limits and premiums on blind people receiving state-funded health care .	after the budget was nearly derailed during a tense start to the week in the senate , the final version passed the house and senate with comparative ease .	it now goes to nixon , who can veto particular appropriations or withhold money from programs if he believes the budgeted expenditures will exceed state revenues .	nixon said in a written statement that he will review every line in the spending plan over the next several weeks to " ensure that we have a balanced budget . "	the budget takes effect july 1 .	the election-year budget includes no tax increases ?	a fact touted by republican legislative leaders and the democratic governor alike .	but it spends almost everything the state expects to take in , leaving a projected cushion of little over $ 6 million ?	far less than normal ?	for any midyear adjustments . "	with the situation we were given , i think we have a really good product , " said house budget committee chairman ryan silvey , r-kansas city .	democrats concurred , to a certain extent .	some suggested that lawmakers could have done more had they been willing to consider ways to increase taxes or boost collections of money missouri already is owed . "	unless we make some tough decisions about revenue in this state , our budget will be in even a bigger hole next year , " said rep. sara lampe , of springfield , the ranking democrat on the house budget committee .	the budget includes a reduction of 956 full-time state employees compared to the current year .	those who remain ?	and earn less than $ 70,000 annually ?	will get a 2 percent pay raise .	lawmakers also included money for several specific new employees , including a " due diligence " officer to scrutinize state economic development deals and an additional animal health inspector to help enforce missouri 's new requirements on commercial dog breeders .	basic aid for k-12 school districts would rise by about $ 5 million , a small amount on top of the $ 3 billion received this year but enough for politicians to tout a record level of funding when they return to the campaign trail .	school aid still would fall in excess of $ 400 million short of what 's called for by the funding formula .	lawmakers rejected a recommendation by nixon to cut funding for public colleges and universities .	they instead held higher education essentially flat , with an increase of $ 3 million split among seven institutions to address perceptions of per-pupil funding disparities .	in one of the budget 's more substantive changes , nursing homes for veterans now will receive most of the state 's fees from casinos , providing a dedicated funding stream to replenish a veterans trust fund that had been projected to run dry in another year .	early childhood programs , which had received those casino fees , will instead be funded through missouri 's share of a nationwide tobacco settlement .	lawmakers ultimately backed away from a house proposal that would have eliminated a health care program for more than 2,800 blind residents who earn too much to qualify for traditional medicaid but have assets of less than $ 20,000 .	the budget provides nearly full funding to continue the program , but it also attempts to cap participation at three times the poverty level and require premiums for those earning over 150 percent of the poverty level , or $ 16,755 annually for an individual .	nixon 's office said the limits are invalid , citing court precedent that lawmakers can not change state statutes through budget bills .	the legislature 's final version of the budget opted against proposed cuts to child care subsidies .	but several other programs were cut .	the budget trims $ 2 million from education for state prisoners , a roughly 20 percent reduction .	it eliminates 40 of the more than 2,300 state employees who handle eligibility determinations for medicaid , food stamps and welfare payments ?	a savings of an additional $ 2 million .	the budget also cuts the subsidies that counties receive for property tax assessments from $ 3.41 per parcel to the $ 3 minimum allowed under state law ?	a savings of $ 1.3 million for the state at the expense of local governments .
the nonprofit group that manages detroit 's riverfront walkway is violating the first amendment by preventing people from holding protests there , the american civil liberties union said monday .	a security guard from the detroit riverfront conservancy ordered a small group of people taking part in an anti-war march along the detroit riverwalk last summer to stop , the aclu said monday .	the aclu said that that violated the free speech rights of the group women in black , and it asked the conservancy to change its policy . "	political speech deserves the strongest protection under the first amendment and nowhere is that more important than on our public sidewalks and parks , " michael j. steinberg , the aclu 's michigan legal director , said in a statement .

the once-popular ethanol industry is scrambling to hold onto billions of dollars in u.s. government subsidies , fighting an increasing public skepticism of the corn-based fuel and wariness from lawmakers who may divert the money to other priorities .	the industry itself ca n't agree on how to persuade congress to keep the subsidies , which now come in the form of tax credits worth about $ 6 billion annually .	one industry group , growth energy , made the bold move thursday of calling for the tax credits to be phased out completely in favor of spending the money on more flex-fuel cars and gasoline pumps that support ethanol .	a rival group , the renewable fuels association , said it 's too late in the year to make such proposals ?	the tax credits expire at the end of the year , and legislative days are numbered .	as the industry bickers over what to do , congress is signaling it 's growing tired of paying for ethanol .	the house ways and means committee is considering slashing the tax credit by 9 cents a gallon ( 3.79 liters ) , from 45 cents to 36 cents , when it looks at a wide range of energy tax credits as early as next week .	that would be the second cut in the credit in as many years .	a key senator also expressed skepticism this week .	sen. jeff bingaman , democratic chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee and a longtime supporter of renewable fuels , said congress should " weigh all factors , including the credit 's very high cost to taxpayers , " when looking to extend the credit .	bingaman noted that the ethanol industry is protected by congressional mandates for its use .	some supporters say they see the writing on the wall . "	the longer we have this support structure in place for ethanol , the more people begin to question it , " said roger johnson , president of the national farmers union , which supports growth energy 's plan .	he says a new approach is needed as the public becomes more skeptical .	democratic rep. earl pomeroy , a member of the ways and means committee , is leading the fight in the house to keep the tax credits .	he says that the 9-cent cut is a good starting point and that he feels optimistic after discussing the issue with fellow committee members and members of the ethanol industry this week .	ethanol producers say expiration of the tax credits , which are paid to oil companies as an incentive to blend gasoline with ethanol , could mean the loss of almost 40 percent of its plants and tougher times for a domestic fuel that is good for national security .	critics say the industry should stand on its own after receiving subsidies for 30 years and argue the tax credits are a waste of taxpayer dollars .	a diverse coalition of groups has argued over the past few years that the increase in production of corn and its diversion for ethanol is making animal feed more expensive , raising prices at the grocery store and tearing up the land .	craig cox of the environmental working group , one of the groups opposing the fuel , says he thinks the industry " hit a wall " in congress as concern over budget deficits have increased . "	status quo support for ethanol is definitely not going to continue , " he said .	growth energy , a group formed in 2008 as some ethanol companies grew worried that their political clout was waning , said it is proposing the phase-out as a way to think more creatively about boosting the industry and the fuel .	the group says ethanol helps reduce america 's dependence on foreign oil , pointing to the gulf oil spill as a reason to turn to the corn-based alternative . "	we are confident that in a fair and open market , ethanol can and will compete successfully against oil , " said tom buis , the group 's ceo .	the industry was also frustrated last month by a delay by the environmental protection agency in deciding whether u.s. car engines can handle higher concentrations of ethanol in gasoline .	but the increase in the maximum blend is expected to be approved later this year .	as critics pile on , industry leaders are on the defensive .	bob dineen , president of the renewable fuels association , said it would be hard to find an energy source around the world that is n't getting some sort of government incentives . "	we 're now 10 percent of the nation 's motor fuel ?	that 's a great story , " he said . "	does it come at a cost ?	yes . "
california officials said wednesday that the drought-stricken state set an unachievable bar to save the salton sea and outlined small projects aimed at staving off the demise of the state 's largest lake , disappointing farmers , environmentalists and others .	kealii bright , the state natural resources agency 's deputy secretary for legislation , said the state erred in 2007 when it unveiled an $ 8.9-billion plan to rescue the disappearing salton sea .	he said the lake must compete with other projects for limited state bond money , and officials highlighted modest endeavors that have yet to be completed , like a $ 1.1-million project for a 70-acre wetlands project .	the administration of gov. jerry brown had been largely silent on the salton sea , even after imperial valley agencies proposed in november that the nation 's largest farm-to-city water transfer be conditioned on the state fulfilling a 2003 pledge to restore the southeastern desert lake .	key state agencies did n't submit written testimony ahead of an all-day workshop at the state water resources control board in sacramento and did n't send senior administration officials . "	the $ 9-billion plan stands in our way when we look at how do we organize around getting resources for the sea because it stands as an unrealistic goal with the circumstances we face today , " said bright , who led a panel of water experts at various state agencies .	imperial valley officials and environmentalists agreed the plan by brown 's predecessor , arnold schwarzenegger , was unrealistic but they hoped to hear something more substantial after more than a decade with almost nothing to show .	the state 's pledge of support for the salton sea was crucial to passing a landmark agreement in 2003 that shifted water from imperial valley to san diego and put southern california on a water diet .	kevin kelley , general manager of the imperial irrigation district , said the comments by state officials " basically showed inertia and futility . " "	the undisputed fact is that this confirms they have projects in the pipeline and they built out zero acres , " he said .	the salton sea is expected to shrink even faster after 2017 , when san diego is no longer required to replenish it with water from the colorado river .	the san diego county water authority agreed to contributions for 15 years as a condition for buying water from the imperial valley .	san diego accounts for 10 percent of the lake 's inflow this year , or enough to supply about 200,000 homes .	its contribution goes to zero in 2018 .	all eyes will be on the five members of the state water resources control board , which had a key role in the 2003 water-sharing agreement .	kimberly delfino , defenders of wildlife 's california program manager , recommended that the state water resources control board " herd the cats " to develop a financing plan within six months .	she said wednesday 's remarks by state officials lacked a sense of urgency .

he swore another man killed four women ?	another man with a different personality who lured them with the same voice and strangled them with the same hands .	the only man accused of serial murder in knox county sits in prison today , a convicted rapist who 'll never serve a day for the killings of four women in a thicket just outside the eastern city limits 18 years ago .	judges ruled a series of missteps by investigators made prosecution of thomas dee huskey , better known as the " zoo man , " impossible - despite a confession and souvenirs from the women 's bodies found in his bedroom .	huskey , 50 , qualifies for parole in two years .	he claimed insanity at the time of his arrest in 1992 and told authorities the women died at the hands of " kyle , " an alternate personality .	the men who made the case say they have just one regret . "	we got beat by the system , " said dan stewart , a retired knox county sheriff 's office detective who helped win huskey 's only conviction . "	he was n't tried for it , but he did it .	we acted in good faith , but the very paper we picked him up on was thrown out by the courts . "	gregory p. isaacs , who along with herbert s. moncier defended huskey , did n't discuss specifics of the case but described it as a personal and professional milestone . "	it was an all-star lineup of attorneys , prosecutors and experts from across the country , " isaacs said . "	when i first began representing tom huskey , it was the biggest case in the state of tennessee .	i had no children then .	now , 17 years and four kids later , we 're still litigating cases involving tom huskey .	it was , is , and always will be an overwhelming case . "	the case began in february 1992 , months before a single prostitute died , when a woman came to knoxville police with a lie that led them to a rapist in the act . "	she told me she 'd been abducted inside the city , taken to a spot in the county and raped , then tied up and robbed , " said tom pressley , a retired knoxville police department investigator . "	she lied to begin with , because she did n't want to admit she was a prostitute .	she took me and showed me where it happened . "	the woman led pressley to a secluded patch of woods off cahaba lane in east knox county , a spot littered with mattresses and used condoms and favored by prostitutes and their johns . "	we got to the dead end , and she said , ' there 's his car , ' " pressley recalled . "	as i went on up there , she saw her stuff .	we went into the woods , and she said , ' there he is now . '	he had this other little girl naked and on her knees . "	pressley stopped huskey at gunpoint and arrested him on the spot .	stewart , the kcso investigator , picked up the case after the women admitted being prostitutes who went to cahaba lane willingly .	the women refused to testify , and huskey went free . "	i think he did what a lot of criminals do , " stewart said . "	he learned from his mistakes .	he decided the next time , he was not going to leave any witnesses behind . "	experts say that 's a common step in the evolution of a serial killer .	most such killers begin with lesser offenses , such as rapes or indecent exposure , and work their way up to the next thrill .	eight months later , on oct. 20 , 1992 , a hunter walked up on the body of patricia rose anderson , 32 , in the same woods off cahaba .	a search by deputies the following week turned up two more bodies , then a fourth - all naked and strangled .	pressley , the kpd investigator , heard the news , recognized the spot and picked up the phone . "	i called the county and told them , ' i think i know who your killer is , ' " pressley said .	police learned huskey had earned the nickname " zoo man " from knoxville 's prostitutes after a series of rapes near the zoo , where he 'd worked in the elephant barn .	victims began to come forward .	a search of huskey 's parents ' home in nearby pigeon forge turned up rope , porn and jewelry detectives believed had been taken from the dead women .	but kcso investigators relied on a search warrant issued by a city judicial commissioner - who an appellate court ruled had no authority to issue the warrant .	huskey claimed to suffer from multiple personality disorder and blamed the killings on " kyle , " an alter ego who claimed to hate huskey and wanted to ruin his life .	prosecutors said he faked mental illness and pulled the name from east knoxville 's kyle avenue , where the huskey family once lived .	those statements hit the trash after judges ruled the confession had been coerced . "	i was there , " said david davenport , a retired tennessee bureau of investigation agent who assisted kcso detectives . "	i disagree .	i personally feel he conned the whole system .	he certainly gave that statement knowing what rights he had .	most of his story , he gleaned from television .	when he became kyle , he showed no remorse .	he knew he was caught . "	the case dragged on for years .	two juries found huskey guilty in rapes committed before the killings , but a jury deadlocked on the murder charges in 1999 .	in october 2005 , 13 years after the discovery of anderson 's body , district attorney general randy nichols gave up the murder case , and criminal court judge richard baumgartner dismissed those charges .	huskey continues to serve a 64-year sentence at the south central correctional facility in clifton , tenn. .	he qualifies for a parole hearing in 2012 .

missouri gov. jay nixon is considering calling a special session this month on legislation aimed at enticing ford motor co. to make its next generation of vehicles in missouri .	nixon held a conference call late friday afternoon with republican and democratic legislative leaders to discuss a potential session that could begin the last week of june .	house majority leader steven tilley and senate majority leader kevin engler , who both were on the call , said the governor would only summon lawmakers to the capitol if there is bipartisan consensus on the plan .	nixon spokesman sam murphey confirmed the potential june 28 start date for a special session and also stressed the need for a " broad consensus . " "	at this time , we are communicating with legislative leaders to determine what level of consensus exists about passing the missouri manufacturing jobs act and ensuring that the necessary cost offsets to pay for the act are part of it , " murphey said in an e-mailed statement to the associated press .	the legislation at issue would let manufacturers keep part of the missouri employee withholding taxes they normally would pay if they invest a certain amount of money on factory improvements for new products .	although it also could apply to other companies , the prime target of the bill is the ford assembly plant in kansas city suburb of claycomo .	ford officials have said there are no plans to shutter the factory , which employs about 3,700 people .	but missouri politicians want to make sure the plant is in the running to continue making the f-150 truck and the next generation of the ford focus and mercury mariner .	legislation containing the incentives failed to pass last month on the final day of missouri 's regular legislative session , when it 's fate was tied to a separate bill revamping missouri 's main pension systems .	tilley , r-perryville , said the governor is looking at a special session agenda that would include both the manufacturing incentives and the pension overhaul .	legislative leaders still need to gauge whether there is enough consensus to pass the package . "	i would be supportive of a special session to do the ford plant and the pension bill as long as there is a bipartisan agreement going in , " tilley said . "	so if we do a special session , we know it 's going to get done , and we do n't waste taxpayer money . "	engler , r-farmington , said it 's important that the increased costs of the proposed manufacturing tax incentives are offset with savings elsewhere in the state budget ?	something the pension overhaul would accomplish .	during the conference call , " all we really came out with is an agreement that we will talk and see if we can come up with some bipartisan solutions , " engler said .	as passed previously by the senate , the pension legislation would have saved money by increasing the minimum retirement age and requiring new state workers to contribute to the retirement system .	the proposed changes would have affected workers added to the payroll in 2011 who are covered by the missouri state employees ' retirement system or through a separate plan for the department of transportation and the missouri state highway patrol .	the demise of the pension bill could mean more budget cuts .	legislators had assumed the pension changes would pass when approving a $ 23 billion operating budget for the fiscal year beginning july 1 .

u.s. secretary of state hillary rodham clinton on sunday appealed to armenia and azerbaijan for a peaceful resolution of a long-running territorial dispute between the neighboring former soviet states , but there were no outward signs of fresh diplomatic progress .	the dispute risks escalating to warfare and has caused diplomatic problems beyond their borders .	clinton , shuttling between capitals , told leaders to act quickly toward settling the matter . "	the final steps toward peace often are the most difficult , but we believe peace is possible , " she said at news conference in baku with her azeri counterpart , elmar mammadyarov .	she soon made the one-hour flight to armenia and drove to the presidential palace in yerevan for a meeting and dinner with president serge sarkisian .	sarkisian said the dispute over nogarno-karabakh was the single most important issue for his country ?	echoing almost word for word a statement hours earlier by azeri president ilham aliyev .	azerbaijan , which shares a border with iran , is of particular strategic importance to the united states .	tens of thousands of flights carrying war supplies to u.s. and allied forces in afghanistan have crossed azeri airspace over the past nine years of fighting there since the sept. 11 terrorist attacks .	azerbaijan also is part of an overland supply chain that is a key alternative to the main land route through pakistan to afghanistan .	the u.s. also has good relations with armenia and has worked to broker an agreement between armenia and turkey on establishing formal diplomatic relations and opening their sealed border after a century of enmity .	turkey , however , has refused to ratify the agreement until armenia removes its military forces of nagorno-karabakh , an enclave in azerbaijan that has been under control of armenian troops and ethnic armenian forces since a 1994 cease-fire .	the truce ended six years of war that killed about 30,000 people and displaced an estimated 1 million .	turks have close cultural and linguistic ties to azerbaijan .	on both of her stops sunday , clinton made a point of stressing the obama administration 's interest in improving human rights conditions .	in bakuk , clinton met with about a dozen azeri youth activists , including bloggers , to encourage them to speak out in favor of social change .	the substance of their conversation was off limits to reporters traveling with clinton . "	i happen to think a lot of the success of countries in the 21st century is because they are open societies , " clinton said in introductory remarks as she and the youths sat around a table beneath a pair of fig trees in the courtyard of a stone building that served as a way station for caravans hundreds of years ago .	she said she raised the issue of freedom of expression in her talks with aliyev . "	you know better than i there is lots of work to be done " to strengthen azerbaijan 's political system , she told them .	she said she and president barack obama have received letters about azeri bloggers imprisoned for their writings .	in her later news conference with the azeri foreign minister , clinton was equally direct , saying that while azerbaijan has made a lot of progress in provide social justice since its independence from the soviet union in the early 1990s , " there 's a lot of room for improvement .

mississippi insurance commissioner mike chaney has shelved for now plans for a state-run insurance exchange .	on wednesday , chaney , a republican , said he was going ahead with plan , saying if mississippi designs its own exchange it can tailor offerings to the needs of the state .	on thursday , chaney changed his mind , according to the clarion-ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/lkaoih ) .	in a statement , chaney said plans for the exchange were far enough along that no final decision was needed before the november presidential election .	the state-run exchange would allow mississippians to shop an online insurance marketplace for comparable rates and provisions .	states that do not create a health insurance exchange by 2014 will be forced to adopt a federally run program .	gov. phil bryant on thursday praised chaney 's decision to wait .
months ago , the cuomo administration promised a decision within weeks on whether to allow hydraulic fracturing for natural gas .	now , one of the key officials says there 's " no timetable " for a decision . "	it 's kind of like shooting at a moving target , " said dr. nirav shah , the state health commissioner .	he said he had recently met with officials from the u.s. environmental protection agency and the marcellus institute , which is based in pennsylvania where hydrofracking is well underway .	the institute aggregates mainstream and trade news and " is committed to providing unfiltered information and analysis organized for business examination and decision support , " according to its website .	shah said wednesday that his meetings with the epa helped inform his public health analysis for gov. andrew cuomo , who will decide if new york will pursue lucrative gas drilling .	the practice is fiercely opposed by environmental groups and cuomo 's political base .	in answer to a reporter 's question , shah said he now has " no timetable " for a decision .	on feb. 13 , cuomo 's environmental conservation commissioner , joe martens , said he expected shah 's review to be done in a few weeks .	on feb. 27 , shah said his health study , the latest milestone in new york 's five-year study of hydrofracking , would take several weeks .	on march 11 , he said he planned a recommendation to the governor " in weeks . " "	i will continue to work on this until i am comfortable , " shah said wednesday .	a february siena college poll shows that new yorkers statewide and even in the southern tier , where much of the lucrative fracking would be done , were split on the issue .	meanwhile , both sides continue their heated rhetoric in lobbying albany . "	new yorkers deserve a thorough , comprehensive health impact study , not a secret health review , " said alex beauchamp of food and water watch and new yorkers against fracking . "	we are confident that a real study of the health impacts of fracking will find that the risks to our air and water are far too great . "	brad gill of the independent oil and gas association , which supports hydrofracking , said years of inaction in albany have come at a " great cost , in lost jobs and opportunity for new york . " "	however , we are encouraged to learn that dr. shah has visited pennsylvania to evaluate its regulatory structure , and is consulting with the u.s. epa , which has concluded on numerous occasions that drilling is safe and has never contaminated groundwater , " gill said .	new york has had a moratorium since 2008 on horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing , which frees natural gas from shale by injecting a well with chemically treated water and sand at enormous pressure .	other states in the gas-rich marcellus shale formation have seen local economies boom as drilling rigs have sprouted up .
four states , the district of columbia and the u.s. virgin islands were denied requests on friday to ignore a new federal law meant to protect the voting rights of deployed troops and other americans overseas , while five states were granted the waiver .	not getting the waiver calls into question how the affected states ?	wisconsin , hawaii , alaska and colorado ?	will comply with deadlines for counting all votes cast for the nov. 2 election by members of the military and other americans living overseas .	the defense department granted delaware , new york , massachusetts , rhode island , and washington the waivers .	the u.s. department of justice said it was working with those denied to bring them into compliance .	the department said it will file lawsuits against any state that does n't voluntarily comply . "	now that we 've been denied , we have to do the best we can and get service members their ballots , " said colorado state rep. joe rice , a colonel in the army reserve who served in iraq and said the army lost his ballot in 2003 .	the wisconsin board that regulates elections issued a statement saying it was committed to ensuring all military and overseas voters fully participate in elections and will begin working immediately with the doj to work out what steps to take next .	wisconsin election director kevin kennedy said before the decision was handed down that a denial would not change how the state holds its sept. 14 primary .	under the new federal law , ballots to members of the military and others living overseas have to be sent 45 days before the nov. 2 election .	wisconsin and other states with august and september primaries sought the waiver saying they do n't have enough time to formalize the ballot and get it sent to those voters by the sept. 18 deadline .	minnesota and vermont responded to the law by moving their sept. 14 primaries back to august .	maryland initially asked for a waiver for its sept. 14 primary , but then determined it could get the ballots to military and overseas voters before the election .	the head of a nonprofit group that advocates for military and overseas voters said the 45-day requirement under the law is n't that big of an issue because all states can e-mail ballots to voter .	the 45-day requirement was the worst-case scenario for how long it would take a ballot to be sent and returned by mail , said susan dzieduszycka-suinat , president and of the overseas vote foundation .	of those that requested a waiver , three have already had their primaries ?	colorado on aug. 10 , washington on aug. 17 and alaska on aug. 24 .	six of them are on sept. 14 ?	delaware , new york , massachusetts , rhode island , wisconsin and washington , d.c. .	the virgin islands ' primary is sept. 11 and hawaii 's is sept. 18 .	advocates who pushed for the military and overseas voter act said more time is needed to send ballots overseas and get them returned and counted on time .	the potential delays and problems are most extreme for members of the military as the mail gets sent from port to port , base to base .	last year the pew center on the states identified problems with the turnaround of military and overseas ballots in 25 states .	the report found that it took states anywhere from 21 to 60 days before an election to mail ballots to overseas voters and sometimes they did n't come back until it was too late to be counted .	bob carey , director of the federal voting assistance program , said shortly after the law passed in october that it would affect 1.4 million military members and their 400,000 voting-age dependents .	many more american civilians living overseas are also affected .	in wisconsin , which has a 10-day post-election grace period and extends other options to military voters , there has been little appetite for holding the primary earlier than the traditional september time .	wisconsin 's final general election ballot is available to overseas voters between 29 and 39 days before the election , which is not enough time to ensure all ballots will be returned in time to be counted , the department of defense said in its denial letter to the state .	in the 2008 general election , of the roughly 10,000 ballots sent to members of the military and overseas voters claiming wisconsin as their home state , 28 percent were not returned .	of that ones that were , only 4 percent were not counted because of errors .	the three major candidates for governor in wisconsin , democrat tom barrett and republicans scott walker and mark neumann , all said the state should move its primary election to earlier in the year .	there were also calls for that in colorado , which had its primary on aug. 10 .	wisconsin republican party spokesman andrew welhouse said the state needs to do everything possible to ensure all of the votes are counted . "	i understand that they 're saying the tight timeline between the primary and the general election makes that tough , but again , we 're talking about the people serving overseas , away from their families , keeping us safe , " welhouse said . "	why would n't the government ?	at every level ?	do everything they can to help them vote ? "
the campaign working to overturn idaho 's education reforms has launched a new radio advertisement calling a laptop program required under the plan an " unfunded mandate " that will require schools to spend millions of dollars they do n't have .	but the ad 's claim that the laptops are unfunded conflicts with the $ 2.5 million lawmakers set aside to pay for the devices this fall when they 'll go to every high school teacher .	students will start getting the laptops in 2013 under the reforms by public schools chief tom luna .	the fight over the three laws in luna 's reform package is heating up with less than three months left before idaho voters decide whether to keep or ditch the sweeping changes that limited collective bargaining , phased out teacher tenure , introduced merit pay and put more technology in the classroom while requiring students to take online classes .	the ad launched last friday by vote no on propositions 1,2,3 says : " tom luna and the politicians in boise are pushing props 1 , 2 and 3 .	prop 3 is an unfunded mandate requiring schools spend millions of dollars they do n't have on expensive laptops that are all too easily broken by kids when they take them home . "	a strong opponent of luna 's reforms in the legislature , retiring rep. brian cronin , is a now a strategist for the campaign working to overturn the laws with a november referendum .	cronin defended use of the term " unfunded mandate " to describe the $ 60 million laptop program , saying it lacks a long-term , stable funding source . "	it 's a big and expensive program .	we 've appropriated a tiny bit of money to pay for the first part of it , but we 're going to continue to raid the current programs we have to pay for something we probably do n't need and is not likely to raise student achievement , " cronin said .	the claim that there 's no assured funding for the laptops in the future , leaving schools on the hook , is inaccurate because the reforms are now idaho law and statutorily require funding , luna spokeswoman melissa mcgrath said . "	the legislature has to fund them or they have to change the law , " mcgrath said .	also , lawmakers did n't dip into other parts of the public schools budget for the laptop money because it was new revenue , she said .	luna 's reforms did shift $ 14.7 million from salaries to pay for other changes , such as increasing the minimum teacher pay , restoring salary increases for teachers furthering their education and paying for high school students to earn college credit .	the shift from salaries was one of the most debated pieces of luna 's plan , and further deductions were eliminated with 2012 legislation , leaving lawmakers to find the money for the reforms .	that initial $ 14.7 million withdrawal , however , was n't backfilled and will continue .	for his part , cronin takes issue with a new ad from the yes for idaho education campaign that makes the case for the reforms , saying : " while we 've seen some improvement in the last few years , we hit a ceiling .	we could either keep banging our heads against that ceiling , or we could pass the students come first legislation . " "	the idea that we 've somehow hit a ceiling and we ca n't do any better is rather absurd , given the very low level of investment that we make , " cronin said , referencing idaho 's status among states with the lowest spending per pupil . "	there are things that we can do , but they generally require greater investment . "
oklahoma city police say a rape victim being interviewed by an officer at a restaurant was able to see the suspect arrested when he walked through the door .	the victim told police she was attacked tuesday at the union bus station when she was trying to enter a restroom .	she fled to a nearby restaurant and waited for police .	the oklahoman reports ( http://is.gd/qkp8ud ) that the officer and victim sat in the dining room to talk when 48-year-old robert m. mcneal walked through the door .	the police report says the woman started to panic when she saw mcneal and the officer confronted him .	when police searched mcneal , they found the victim 's bus ticket in one of his socks .	officials say mcneal is a registered sex offender from illinois .
the federal government has slightly lowered its official estimates of this year 's u.s. spring wheat , durum wheat , barley and oats crops , after taking the unusual step of resurveying farmers in six states .	the revisions are unlikely to influence prices for farmers or consumers , said darin newsom , a senior analyst at omaha , neb.-based market information company dtn .	the u.s. department of agriculture decided to update its small grains estimates because they were based on farmer surveys in early september , when there was significant unharvested acreage in north dakota , montana , idaho , wyoming , oregon and washington because of bad weather .	the late-september small grains summary usually is usda 's final word on production , but the agency contacted some farmers a second time because those with crops in the field earlier in the month had been forced to estimate production on those acres .	estimates of all four crops dropped , but the downward revisions released tuesday were less than 4 percent for durum , less than 2 percent for spring wheat and in the case of oats and barley less than 1 percent .	a big reason for the slight drops was a decrease in the average bushels per acre of the crops , said darin jantzi , director of usda 's national agricultural statistics service field office in north dakota , which leads the nation in the production of spring wheat , durum wheat and barley . "	the later the crop gets to be , the lower the yield gets to be , " he said .	all crops except durum also saw a slight drop in harvested acres from the september report . "	just a little bit there at the end , even though ( farmers ) had good weather conditions they were n't able to go out and get , " jantzi said .	spring wheat typically is used for bread products and durum wheat for pasta .	oats are used for food for both people and animals , and barley is the main ingredient in beer .

"	we are looking at it as a major tragedy that was averted , " hackensack fire department lt. stephen lindner said late saturday morning .	officials said rescuers dug through debris overnight to reach the vehicles feared to contain occupants .	but when searchers got to the cars early saturday , lindner said they did n't find anyone inside .	the three-story garage in hackensack pancaked friday morning when the canopy fell on it .	the top of the garage , level with the street , was littered with dirt , debris and glass , and the pavement split into chunks .	rescuers needed to clear debris and shore up the structure before attempting a rescue .	both cars had their flashers on during the rescue operation , leading to reports that people may have been inside , lindner said .	but no one was in the car on the first level down , and it was determined that no one in the car on the lower level , either .	lindner said the force of the collapse likely knocked the cars around , causing their flashers to activate .	it may be up to a week before residents ?	who were evacuated as a precaution ?	will be allowed to return to the building .	engineers continue to assess the building 's structure .	hackensack construction official joseph mellone said the building appeared to be structurally sound , but part of the garage ?	which wraps around three sides of the building ?	was still in peril of collapsing further .	if that occurs , it would not have an effect the structural integrity of the building , mellone said .	none of the more than 400 occupants of the two buildings that use the parking garage have been reported missing , lindner said .	using a remote camera and a robot friday , rescuers had reported seeing one victim in a car on the first level down but could n't reach the vehicle because they were concerned about the possibility of another collapse .	it was n't clear saturday why officials believed someone was in the car or how the camera image appeared to have resembled a person . "	we were in rescue mode , " lindner said . "	we had to try and get anybody out who was in there . "	it 's also unclear why the canopy fell from the 22-year-old building , which is next to the garage .	several residents said workers had uprooted a tree between the street and the building within the past few months , and that a leak in the basement was being fixed .	resident chris baldo was in his first-floor unit when he felt the building shake .	he looked out his window and the garage " was just gone , " he said .	tax records show the condo tower was built in 1988 .	equity residential properties of chicago bought in 1998 for $ 36.3 million .	marty mckenna , a spokesman for equity residential , said the building owner did not have much information yet about what happened .	police were checking with the building management company for a list of tenants , but no one was reported missing so far , chief tomas padilla said .

the u.s. economy grew at a 3.6 percent annual rate from july through september , the fastest since early 2012 .	but nearly half the growth came from a buildup in business stockpiles , a trend that could reverse in the current quarter and hold back growth .	the commerce department 's second estimate of third-quarter growth released thursday was sharply higher than the initial 2.8 percent rate reported last month .	and it was well above the 2.5 percent growth rate for the april-june quarter .	almost the entire third-quarter revision came from a big jump in stockpiles .	consumer spending , the lifeblood of the economy , was the weakest in nearly four years .	when excluding inventories , the economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the third quarter , down from 2.1 percent in the spring .	that 's in line with the same subpar rate that the economy has seen since the great recession ended four years ago .	many economists believe that overall growth will be around 2 percent in the current october-december period .	business stockpiles contributed 1.7 percent points to growth , twice the contribution reported last month in the first estimate .	companies are likely to cut back on restocking , especially if they do n't see consumers stepping up spending .	in the third-quarter , consumers increased their spending at a tepid 1.4 percent annual rate .	that was the slowest since the final quarter of 2009 , a few months after the recession officially ended .	consumer spending typically drives 70 percent of economic activity .	but the spending activity in the third quarter was held back by flat spending on services .	that may have reflected an unusually mild summer , which cut demand for air conditioning .	one hopeful sign : consumer spent on goods at the fastest rate since early 2012 .	other details in the report were mixed .	business investment in equipment was flat in the third quarter .	spending on housing construction remained strong , rising at an annual rate of 13 percent .	government spending edged up at a slight 0.4 percent annual rate in the summer .	the biggest spending increase in state and local government spending since 2009 offset another decline in federal expenditures .	a number reports have offered some promise that the fourth quarter could be stronger than many economists are predicting .	in october , spending at retail businesses rose solidly , u.s. exports grew to a record level and employers added 204,000 jobs .	november car sales rose 9 percent and are running at an annual rate of 16.4 million , the best performance of the year , according to autodata corp. .	but early reports on holiday shopping have been disappointing .	the national retail federation estimates that sales over last week 's four-day thanksgiving day weekend ?	arguably the most crucial shopping stretch for retail businesses ?	fell for the first time since the group began keeping track in 2006 .	faster growth could make the federal reserve more inclined to begin slowing its bond purchases , which have kept long-term interest rates low and encouraged more borrowing and spending .	many economists believe the central bank will not reduce the $ 85 billion-a-month pace when it meets later this month .
george zimmerman made complaints about sanford 's police department , accusing officers of being lazy and calling for the repeal of the outgoing police chief 's pension , at a community forum more than a year before he shot and killed florida teenager trayvon martin .	the miami herald first reported details from the january 2011 meeting on wednesday from an audio recording .	in the nearly three-minute tape obtained by the associated press , zimmerman tells city commissioners about the " disgusting " behavior of officers , which he says he witnessed as part of a ride along program .	he also asked sanford mayor jeff triplett to look into his accusations and called for outgoing sanford police chief brian tooley 's pension to be repealed because of what zimmerman said were cover-ups and corruption within the department .
both chad kassem and the vinyl records he sells are making an unexpected comeback from near oblivion .	kassem , who is cajun , started as an unwilling transplant to kansas from louisiana .	he now spends his days behind a messy desk covered with stacks of lps thinking about how to extend his unlikely music empire based on an obsolete technology , the wichita eagle ( http://bit.ly/175o2nk ) reports .	his acoustic sounds and its several subsidiaries employ 90 people spread over three buildings in the city 's industrial north end .	he has businesses that press new vinyl records , make and distribute high-quality digital downloads , buy and sell old records , and buy and sell audio equipment .	he even has a recording studio in an old church downtown .	he owns a record factory , quality record pressings , at a time when vinyl is again a hot thing in music after nearly disappearing in the early 1990s .	through the first 11 months of 2014 , 8 million vinyl records were sold , a 49 percent increase over the year before , according to nielsen soundscan .	as a result , demand is red hot for time at his plant .	he put a second shift at his record-making company , quality record pressings , this summer and company makes 6,000 albums a day .	he expects to put on a third shift in the next few months .	he has to tell record companies they have to wait to get their product on his presses . "	the whole industry is months and months behind , " he said .	the reason for the revival is simple , he said : people love the sound of vinyl .	the analog sound is warmer , fuller , richer than what 's delivered by the mass market compact discs .	he 's married to the sound , not necessarily the technology .	in the last year , he also launched a digital download service , super hirez digital , that provides the same high quality sound in digital that it does in analog .	it produces reissues under its analogue productions label and its new music under apo records label .	earlier this month , kassem was in los angeles to receive the los angeles and orange county audio society 's 21st annual founders award for extraordinary contributions to audiophiles worldwide .	to some extent the vinyl revival is a luxury niche , like curated adventure travel or rolex watches .	the new records , heavy at 180-200 grams with beautifully laid out art and liner notes , cost in the range of $ 30 to $ 50 .	it 's easy to spend a few thousand dollars a year on vinyl .	audiophiles , the people who really love the music , are willing to pay for it .	the company 's main demographic is upper-income middle-aged white men , said david clouston , the company 's communications associate .	some can even afford the $ 30,000 turntables sold in the company 's catalog . "	the people who spend that kind of money tend to set up listening rooms in their homes - i hate to say 1 percent , but yeah , " clouston said .	but it 's not about money , it 's about the music . "	i 'm really no different from the guys who buy records from me , " he said . "	what 's fun is to come in and hear my favorite music .	reissue an album and hear it sounding better than it 's ever sounded before . "	a visit to acoustic sounds can be a startling experience because the staff here are touching , even tweaking , some of the most emblematic music of the last 70 years .	earlier this month , a visit through the pressing room revealed neil young 's new solo " storytone " on a couple of the record-pressing machines , and reissues of bob dylan 's " bringing it all back home " and the beach boys ' " surfin ' safari " on other machines .	the reissues start with the original masters , hidden away in vaults in los angeles or new york .	a master engineer recuts a first copy , called a " lacquer , " which is delivered overnight to salina .	he has a crew that handles the high-skilled work of making stampers , the dies that put the grooves on the vinyl .	production workers coat the " lacquer " with silver and then a nickel alloy .	that is used to create a second copy , " the mother , " which is used to create " stampers , " the dies used to stamp the grooves on the hot vinyl .	the result of this reprocessing can be pretty impressive .	he and his staff played sam cooke 's " bring it on home to me " in the company 's listening room .	the original featured cooke 's soulful voice , but the vocal edges were ragged and the sound a little muddy as if coming from the next room - caused by time and the limitations of a 1960s-era mass market disc .	the company 's reissued version , taken from the original master and reproduced on high quality vinyl , is clearly the same song , but considerably cleaner and brighter .	sam cooke 's voice had moved into the same room as the listener . "	sometimes we blow them away , sometimes it 's just a little bit better , " kassem said .	in the graphics department , workers were cleaning up the original photos of those beach boys covers where brian , dennis and carl wilson , mike love and al jardine are frolicking on a beach .	the designers work with the studios to get the original photos or , sometimes , to create their own designs if it 's something like a boxed set .	the company also retains it longtime business of buying and selling records .	the company now has nearly 100,000 records in the company headquarters and in its climate-controlled warehouse .	kassem 's big corner office is messy , his desk piled high with records and cds that he is in the midst of evaluating .	next to his desk sits a turntable .	on the floor in front of his desk are more stacks of records and beyond those , a couple of large speakers directed at his chair , making it the room 's " sweet spot . "	it was n't very obvious in 1984 that kassem was headed for success .	he grew up in cajun country , lafayette , la. , and even after 30 years in kansas , he still has a cajun accent .	he freely acknowledges that he partied , drank and smoked pot heavily in his teen years , barely graduating high school .	by age 21 , he faced a judge and a choice : jail time or a drug treatment/halfway house in salina .	coming to kansas was the best thing that ever happened , he said .	after seven months , his brain finally cleared , and he started to see the world a little more clearly .	he remained in salina , at first , because kansas had a law that allowed him to cut his probation if he stayed sober .	he also realized that going back to louisiana would probably mean going back to his old ways .	as he killed time waiting , he continued his business of buying and selling records .	by 1985 , he was living in a small apartment , and he placed an ad in the back of audio magazine .	his business took off .	by 1990 , he said , he was doing $ 100,000 a month in record sales out of his house .	city inspectors came down on him . "	i do n't think they minded the ups trucks coming to the house every day , but when the 18-wheelers started coming ... , " he said .	he 's moved the business five times since then , and every time he moves , he thinks he 's arrived and will never have to move again .	but he 's an entrepreneur , always looking for new or complementary niches .	he took major financial risks in opening the pressing plant in 2011 and the digital download business last year .	next year , he plans to open a printing plant for labels and add more vinyl pressing machines . "	i could never have imagined you can do what you love for a living , " he said .	he 's still torn by his cajun heart and his midwestern head .	he still loves louisiana , its culture and its fun-loving attitude .	but he 's stayed in salina because , he says , kansans are hard-working , modest and conscientious .	it 's a good place to build a business , he said .	plus , he 's trying to prove a point .	after he completed his probation in kansas , his probation officer wrote a letter to officials in louisiana .	the result : louisiana then-gov .	edwin edwards actually issued kassem a full pardon .	his life , to some extent , is a validation of that gesture .	he 's stayed in salina , stayed out of trouble , built a solid business that employs a lot of people .	kassem is still kind of emotional about it . "	they did n't waste their pardon , " he said .

a three-member review board at a california naval base voted thursday against discharging a 26-year-old petty officer who was investigated for violating the military 's ban on openly gay servicemembers , according to the sailor at the center of the probe .	petty office second class derek morado said the three-member board composed of two officers and a fellow enlisted man voted unanimously after a six-hour hearing at lemoore naval air station to allow him to serve out the remaining three years of his current enlistment .	the board 's recommendation still must be reviewed by the navy 's military personnel command , but morado said he thinks that is more of a formality than an obstacle that could still end the career he started straight out of high school . "	it 's much harder to keep me out than it is to keep me , " he said . "	obviously , i will have to continue to meet the navy 's standards from here on out .	as long as i can do that , i can continue to have a very good career . "	navy officials did not immediately confirm morado 's account or comment on it .	morado is one of a handful of servicemembers who have been subject to discharge proceedings ?	and one of very few to go public with their stories __ since congress voted to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " ban on openly gay troops in december , according to servicemembers legal defense network . .	the pentagon has said that no troops have been fired under the 1993 policy since then , although " do n't ask , do n't tell " remains in effect until military leaders certify the armed forces are ready to integrate openly gay troops .	morado , a sacramento native who has been stationed at lemoore near fresno for three years and is transferring to san diego next week , said he had been under investigation for violating the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy since 2009 , when someone reported seeing a picture of him kissing a male friend and that he described himself as gay on his myspace page . . "	i 've kind of served since the beginning comfortably .	i 've never gone out of the way to hide who i was , " he said . "	throughout my career i 've met nothing but support or people not really caring , which is why i got complacent .	but i finally crossed paths with someone who cared . "	during his discharge hearing on thursday , two active duty personnel and two civilian co-workers testified as character witnesses on his behalf .	his navy lawyer told the board that in his closing argument that with " do n't ask , do n't tell " on its way out , ending morado 's career now would not be morally sound , according to morado .	the review board did not say if the status of the policy factored into its decision , but simply stated that it was in the navy 's interet to retain morado , he said .

the enthusiasm surrounding the start of butch jones ' coaching tenure at tennessee might not pack neyland stadium just yet .	tennessee associate athletic director chris fuller said season ticket sales were at about 58,000 as of wednesday morning .	that represents a 2.8 percent decrease from last year , when about 59,700 had been sold at this point .	fuller says he still expects overall attendance to increase after it fell to its lowest level since 1979 last year .	fuller said slightly over 90,000 tickets have been purchased for saturday 's season opener with austin peay .	last year 's home opener with georgia state drew an announced crowd of 87,821 . "	clearly , ( the season ticket sales ) are n't a referendum on our coach and the energy around our program , " fuller said . "	i think it probably is a little bit of a statement about our home schedule .	obviously we do n't have alabama and florida on our home schedule this year , and our non-conference schedule is not wildly attractive , so i 'd say it 's probably pretty much in keeping with what we expected . "	tennessee opens its schedule saturday against austin peay , a football championship subdivision program .	the volunteers ' other non-conference home games are against sun belt schools south alabama and western kentucky .	tennessee 's only two home sellouts last year came against alabama and florida , which are n't included in this year 's home schedule .	the volunteers ' lack of recent success on the field has led to fewer fans in the stands .	tennessee has posted three straight losing seasons for the first time since 1909-11 .	after averaging over 100,000 fans per game every year from 1996-2008 , tennessee has been below that mark each of the last four seasons .	tennessee had an average attendance of 89,965 last year . "	it 's just because they have n't been winning , " said season ticket holder jim conner of brentwood , tenn. " winning produces everything . "	fuller remains optimistic that tennessee 's average attendance this season could reach 95,000 , which would represent its highest total since 2010 .	neyland stadium 's seating capacity is 102,455 . "	i think that 's a pretty ambitious target , but i think it 's also attainable , " fuller said .	fuller cited the increased sales tennessee is getting in its three-game packages .	tennessee also is expecting more support from the student body .	last year , tennessee 's average general student attendance was about 5,000 , less than half its allocation of 11,700 .	fuller said about 9,000 students have purchased tickets for the austin peay game .	the vols drew a crowd of 61,076 for the orange & white game - the second-highest total for a spring game in school history - and an open practice this month had an announced attendance of 39,000 , though admission was free for both events .	tennessee took one unusual step to improve its attendance by selling discounted tickets for 6,700 upper-deck seats in the south end zone .	those tickets are being sold for $ 20 for the austin peay , western kentucky and south alabama games .	those seats currently are selling for $ 80 each for the georgia and south carolina games , $ 70 for the auburn game and $ 55 for the vanderbilt game , though those prices may be adjusted as the season goes on .

"	they got paid for work they did n't do ?	that 's theft of state resources , " said the center 's former superintendent , kelly cunningham , referring to several cases .	nevertheless , since january , the center has fired eight employees , suspended four and slapped 26 others with letters of reprimand or other discipline for misconduct unrelated to the auditor 's probe .	among those fired : a high-ranking manager who turned in a made-up investigative report , staffers accused of viewing pornography on their work computers , and two employees who forged doctor 's notes to cover up their absenteeism .	the times based its investigation on hundreds of pages of public records and numerous interviews .	the center , which has 371 employees , detains and treats the state 's most dangerous sex offenders after they 've completed their prison terms ; the offenders are deemed too dangerous to return to society .	workers there are disciplined at a rate four times that of workers in the state prison system , the times reported .	earlier this year , the times reported that the state had wasted millions of dollars at the center because of lack of oversight , unchecked defense costs and delayed commitment trials .	the state spends about $ 170,000 a year for each of the 297 sex offenders on mcneil island .	in 2009 , cunningham ?	then the center 's new superintendent ?	was asked to cut staff and expenses as the state budget crisis peaked .	as he looked for ways to save money , he was surprised to see the center paying about $ 150,000 a month in overtime .	he and other managers found rampant problems .	he warned staffers they would face stiff discipline if they abused policies on attendance and leave .	comparing time sheets and sick-leave slips with shift reports and security-card readers , they found that more than 20 percent of the staff had inconsistencies in their attendance , according to an internal report obtained by the times through a public-records request .	employees were getting paid for hours in which they were never even on the island or had left early , based on shift reports , logs and card readers , cunningham said .	he also believed some employees had developed a scheme in which one would call in sick so another would get paid overtime to cover the shift , and then they 'd switch roles and do it again .	believing the conduct might be criminal , cunningham said he asked the washington state patrol to investigate , but it deferred to the state auditor .	cunningham submitted a detailed report to the auditor in summer 2010 .	the report included blatant examples of attendance abuse , cunningham said .	he believed all his review needed was a " bow on it . "	but the agency 's investigation has lingered for two and half years .	the auditor 's director of special investigations , jim brittain , says other cases were given priority , and the mcneil island investigation should be completed by the end of next month .	if the audit finds evidence of criminal activity , it will refer its conclusions to the state attorney general 's office for any criminal charges and attempt to recoup state money .	cunningham , who left the center in august to become a deputy director at the state department of fish and wildlife , said he was frustrated the auditor 's office did n't finish its investigation before he transferred .
indiana gov. mitch daniels joined homeowners , lobbying groups and others on wednesday to promote a statewide ballot measure that would place property tax caps into the state constitution .	they noted that constitutional limits on property tax bills would make it harder for judges or state lawmakers to undo the caps .	proponents also said the limits would bring more predictability to a system that produced huge increases for many homeowners a few years ago . "	what started as a genuine grassroots movement must be finished in that fashion , " daniels said while visiting the beech grove home of denise pellow-douglas and her husband , randy douglas .	opponents of the caps , including the indiana urban schools association , argued that the limits hurt the ability of local governments and schools to raise money and deliver services .	the general assembly passed a law in 2008 that generally limits property tax bills to 1 percent of homes ' assessed value , with 2 percent caps on farmland and rental property and 3 percent limits on business property .	a simple majority vote in the upcoming election would place the caps in the state constitution .	the proposed amendment twice cleared the general assembly , which made it eligible for a statewide vote .	daniels said the caps have cut homeowners ' tax bills by about 30 percent .	the nonpartisan legislative services agency projected that the caps would save property owners about $ 465 million this year , but leave counties , cities , other local governments and schools without the money .	there are some exceptions .	there are different caps in lake and st. joseph counties , and local voters can approve referendums to exceed the limits for construction projects or increased operating spending by school districts .	the constitutional amendment was favored by 64 percent of indiana residents surveyed in december by ball state university 's bowen center for public affairs .	a coalition calling itself the hoosier property tax reform alliance plans a media campaign to push for passage of the amendment .	the group includes the indiana association of realtors , indiana builders association , indiana manufacturers association and the indiana apartment association .	paul wyman , the indiana association of realtors ' former president , noted that property tax bills for many homeowners went up 100 percent or more in 2007 .	that followed an overhaul to the system so assessed value was based more closely on the price that property fetches on the market .	wyman said the high bills forced some homeowners to give up more than just wants . "	for some families it was truly about giving up their needs , " wyman said .	the bill for the douglas family , whose moderate brick and wood house the governor visited on wednesday , was $ 1,663 in 2007 .	this year , it 's $ 1,167 . "	property tax caps let us know what to expect , which is a must when you 're raising two sons like randy and i are , and one of them is in college , " denise pellow-douglas said .	voters in the beech grove schools district approved a referendum in 2009 that allowed property tax bills to exceed the statutory caps this year .	tom keeley , business manager for the district , said it would have been forced to scrap busing this year had voters not approved the local referendum .	even with its passage , the district is projected to take in about $ 500,000 to $ 750,000 less next year than it would have gotten without the caps . "	we were able to pay our bills this year , but i anticipate having some serious problems to continue the services we have in 2011 and 2012 , " keeley said . "	it 's a very serious challenge for government units , no doubt . "

its riveting , guy-centric story places readers behind the wheel as two vastly different drivers compete for formula 1 glory .	pulling a dramatic narrative from auto racing is tougher than it might seem .	hollywood 's efforts , for example , often sputter and come up short .	in spite of stunning photography , " grand prix " ( 1966 ) tends to throttle down with the off-track action , particularly its strained love stories . "	le mans " ( 1971 ) fails to find a strong dramatic center to complement its documentarylike approach . "	the limit " avoids such hazards .	with vivid and straight-on writing , journalist and author michael cannell explores the friction between drivers and owners , drivers and drivers , and drivers and their own psyches .	the lead-up to the book 's focal point , the 1961 grand prix title , is a compelling history of the era and its fascinating characters .	along the way cannell explains just enough about engines and other mechanical matters to set the stage .	due to safety initiatives and other changes , racing is n't the deadly pursuit it once was .	when the sport kicked back into high gear after world war ii , death was common .	in the 1953 running of the 1,933-mile carrera panamericana , stretching from one end of mexico to the other , 11 competitors died ?	as did six spectators who got too close to the over-the-road action .	it did not speak well of auto racing when , in 1955 , a crash at le mans killed one driver and 83 spectators but did n't end the season or the event .	into this gladiatorlike world come the stars of " the limit " : a quiet southern california gearhead-turned-driver , phil hill , and a high-spirited german aristocrat , count wolfgang von trips .	hill 's driving skills developed faster than his nerves ?	watching a fellow driver burn to death after a wreck did n't help his mental game .	von trips earned the nickname " count von crash " for speed and daring that could easily send his car out of control .	they were teammates as well as competitors for the 1961 championship series , which climaxed with the italian grand prix , a race of triumph and horror .	in prose as fast and unadorned as an early ferrari , cannell rolls out an entertaining and exciting story on the way to the finish line .

some of the most notorious figures of argentina 's " dirty war " were convicted thursday of kidnapping , torturing and murdering 22 people at the beginning of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship when the country cracked down on leftist dissent .	family members of the victims cheered and hugged as a judge handed down the sentences for gen. luciano menendez and former police intelligence chief roberto albornoz : life in prison for crimes against humanity committed at a secret detention center in provincial tucuman .	two former police officers ?	brothers luis armando de candido and carlos esteban de candido ?	were sentenced to 18 and 3 years , respectively .	their victims included diana oesterheld , who was seven months pregnant when she disappeared .	her mother , elsa sanchez , told the associated press the sentences gave her a feeling of " enormous tranquility " after many years of anxiety . "	we did n't have justice for so long , " said sanchez , whose husband , political cartoonist hector oesterheld , and their other three daughters also were killed .	sanchez , 85 , said the verdict has given her the strength to continue searching for diana 's child .	many pregnant prisoners were killed after giving birth in prison , their babies adopted by people allied with the dictatorship .	the tucuman trial riveted argentina after a protected witness suddenly presented 259 pages of secret documents he smuggled from the detention center and hid in his floorboards for three decades .	the evidence included a list of 293 people detained by albornoz , with notations indicating whether they would live or die .	the list provided many family members with the first information about the fate of their loved ones , more than 30 years after they were kidnapped .	the documents ?	copies of which were obtained by the ap ?	also include handwritten notes made during torture sessions , reports about spying efforts , the names of intelligence agents and the identities of bodies .	many bear the stamps and signatures of police and military agencies and officials .	after argentina 's return to democracy , an official commission used missing-person complaints and survivors ' memories to determine that the junta killed about 13,000 people , though human rights groups believe as many as 30,000 died .	during the trial , menendez justified his leadership of the military response to leftist guerrillas in 10 provinces across northern argentina by saying they had to prevent a communist takeover . "	these were not peaceful citizens , " he said .	the other defendants said they were following orders .	in 2008 , menendez was convicted in tucuman of the 1976 disappearance of sen. guillermo vargas .	tucuman 's former de-facto governor , antonio bussi , also convicted in the vargas case , was separated from this latest trial due to poor health .	about 20 dictatorship-era human rights cases are being tried this year in argentina , and verdicts have been reached in 23 others since amnesty laws were overturned in 2005 .

a federal judge in nebraska who has stirred up a hornet 's nest for suggesting that young women attorneys need to dress more conservatively in court has the support of one woman who holds his judicial career in her hands : chief u.s. district judge laurie smith camp .	senior u.s. district judge richard kopf weighed in tuesday on the topic of young women and how they dress for court on his online blog , " hercules and the umpire . "	as a senior judge , kopf is semiretired , taking cases assigned him .	a chief judge unhappy with a senior judge 's behavior could simply stop assigning him cases .	that 's not going to happen in kopf 's case , smith camp said wednesday . "	he is not sexist , and he is not a dirty old man , " smith camp said .	the blog itself is unusual for a federal judge .	in it , kopf has posted everything from videos of his grandkids to opinions on various court cases , and once told congress to " go to hell " for allowing a brief federal government shutdown last year .	he had declared in late december that he was shutting down the blog but spontaneously resumed earlier this month , posting about his battle with hodgkin 's lymphoma , the legalization of medical marijuana and the death of anti-gay pastor fred phelps sr. .	but it was his post tuesday , which he titled " on being a dirty old man and how young women lawyers dress , " that has created the blog 's most controversy to date .	in it , kopf relaying a story about a local female attorney in her late 20s whom he describes as brilliant , eloquently , zealous , always prepared and having respect for her courtroom opponents .	she also " wears very short skirts and shows lots of her ample chest , " kopf wrote . "	i especially appreciate the last two attributes . "	kopf goes on to offer " rules " for young women attorneys in dressing for court , including , " you ca n't win .	men are both pigs and prudes .	get over it . "	comments on the judge 's blog run the gamut from support to those calling him sexist .	kopf apologized on the blog to those he offended and noted that the young female attorney referenced in his blog was an amalgam of more than one person and more than one event .	kopf declined to comment for the associated press on wednesday .	others had plenty to say . "	women have it a million times harder than men when it comes to presenting themselves professionally , " said lauren stiller rikleen , a boston attorney and author of " ending the gauntlet : removing the barriers to women 's success in the law , " who also consults and speaks on gender issues . "	women get mixed messages all the time .	do n't dress provocatively .	do n't look dowdy .	this blog just perpetuated that double standard . "	brenda beadle , the chief deputy prosecutor for douglas county ?	nebraska 's largest ?	said she was shocked by the judge 's remarks . "	it 's not that i disagreed with what he said .	certainly both men and women can sometimes dress inappropriately for court , " beadle said . "	but i took issue with the objectifying of women and commenting about his personal thoughts about women .	i just thought it was distasteful and inappropriate . "	smith camp , the chief judge , said wednesday that kopf 's blog provokes conversation , although " he has said some things that i would not say . "	she also confirmed that she submitted her own written comment to kopf 's blog post tuesday , recalling that as a young attorney , she wore suits several sizes too big so as not to draw attention to herself . "	it 's unfortunate , but there truly are judges who do n't hear a word a female lawyer says in oral argument until the judge has evaluated and digested her appearance , " smith camp wrote , noting the she advises young female attorneys to " dress in a way that no one will remember what they wore . "	tammy king , assistant dean for career development at creighton university 's law school , organizes a " dress for success " program every year for creighton law students to encourage conservative , appropriate dress for the courtroom .	she took exception to kopf 's singling out women for inappropriate dress in court , but added , " the topic of professionalism is something that should be discussed .	both men and women can make the mistake of inappropriate dress in court . "	it 's probably a bad idea for a judge to have a public opinion blog , said paul d. carrington , professor of law at duke university . "	i might very well encourage the judge to give it up , " carrington said . "	they do seem to be a device for saying things that maybe should n't be said . "
patti smith remembers the first time she saw lou reed in person .	it was 1970 and reed and the velvet underground were performing at the manhattan club max 's kansas city . "	i was so taken with their music , " she said monday as she spoke of her friend , inspiration and fellow poet-musician , who died sunday at age 71 . "	i made it my business to study him .	his process completely spoke to me , the process of merging poetry with these surf rhythms , this pulsing loop .	you could get into a trance listening to 12 minutes of ' sister ray . ' "	interviewed by telephone , smith said that reed brought " the sensibility of art and literature " to rock music , a sensibility she has long shared .	when she and reed would see each other , they often talked about poetry , about hart crane or walt whitman or federico garcia lorca . "	he could speak articulately about any poet , " she said .	smith said she was pleased by the global impact of reed 's passing and by the stories of how his songs affected people 's lives .	she cited " pale blue eyes " as a personal favorite .	she said that the fragile , weary ballad reminded her of her late , blue-eyed husband , guitarist fred " sonic " smith . "	i never fail to think of him and his gaze when i 'm singing that or hear that song , " she said . "	lou had a gift of taking very simple lines , ' linger on , your pale blue eyes , ' and make it so they magnify on their own .	that song has always haunted me . "	smith also praised reed 's romantic " perfect day . "	she sings it often in concert and finds herself moved when audiences join in on the chorus . "	so many of us have benefited from the work he has done , " she said . "	we all owe him a debt .	most of us that owe a debt are not very happy to own up to it .	sometimes you like to imagine that you did everything on your own .	but i think with lou that everyone will stand in line to say thank you , in their own way . "

running back herman jacobs of east tennessee state wanted to obtain it .	linebacker marc buoniconti of the citadel wanted to stop him .	two players with little in common except their passion for football intersected .	buoniconti 's neck was dislocated .	jacob 's heart was broken .	both were paralyzed by their violent collision , although the toll took different forms .	buoniconti left the stadium in an ambulance and a doctor confirmed what buoniconti knew as he lay numb on the field after the tackle : he was a quadriplegic .	jacobs finished the game and the season , but something disconnected inside him .	buoniconti was confined to a wheelchair , walking only in his dreams .	jacobs was shackled by guilt , sleepwalking through life .	thirty years later , buoniconti and jacobs recall the third-down play from oct. 26 , 1985 , in crystalline detail .	ultimately , it made them best friends . "	the quarterback pitched me the ball , " jacobs said . "	i could see marc coming .	first i got hit low by another player and flipped through the air .	then marc hit me in my lower back .	it was the hardest hit i 've ever taken . "	buoniconti fought off one block , sprinted toward the somersaulting jacobs and dove helmet-first into the 20 on jacob 's jersey . "	next thing i knew , bam ! "	buoniconti said . "	my body rolled over and my arm flopped to my side and i thought , ' whose arm is that ?	oh , that 's my arm .	ok , i am hurt bad .	i am paralyzed .	do n't panic .	do n't freak out . ' "	buoniconti feels pride to this day that he stopped jacobs for no gain .	the citadel won the game .	the two remain avid football fans .	they talked a lot about college , pro and high school football friday during lunch in coconut grove , after greeting each other with a gentle head butt .	they could be bitter about the devastating play that linked them forever .	instead , they believe they were transformed .	eight years ago , buoniconti reached down and rescued jacobs , persuaded him to move to miami , enroll in culinary school , pursue a career as a chef and leave behind his lonely existence in tennessee , where he worked at dead-end fast-food jobs .	jacobs , in turn , fueled a new source of energy in buoniconti , president of the miami project to cure paralysis , which has charted a recent series of breakthroughs in research and clinical trials , in pioneering transplantation of schwann and stem cells into the spinal cord , in brain stimulation and in hypothermia treatment .	buoniconti 's dream of walking again does n't seem fanciful or far-fetched anymore .	the miami project , co-founded by buoniconti 's father , former dolphin linebacker nick , and dr. barth green , has raised $ 450 million in three decades and plans to build a new rehabilitation center at the university of miami miller school of medicine . "	people called us crazy and it 's been a long and grueling journey but at last we 're seeing the fruits of the game plan , " nick buoniconti said . "	marc is the face of the project .	all the advances may not help him , but that does n't matter .	what propels him is helping others . "	buoniconti , 49 , who sips or puffs on a tube to move his wheelchair and relies on 24-hour nursing care , is a missionary of hope for patients with spinal cord injuries .	whether he is dealing with u.s. presidents , corporate titans , scientists or friends who need his counsel , he transmits optimism .	paralysis gave buoniconti a purpose . "	my injury saved me because i was going in the wrong direction , " buoniconti said , remembering his days as a carouser at columbus high , including the time he and two friends streaked through the halls of all-girls lourdes academy , wearing only ski masks and sneakers , laughing uproariously as the nuns yelled at them in disgust .	his parents sent him to the citadel to drum discipline into him . "	i was a semester or two from flunking out of college .	i had no plan or future outside of football .	my mom says i probably would have wound up in jail or dead .	i 'd flown through life with reckless abandon and that 's how i played the game .	i dove into herman and the impact changed everything . "	jacobs , 51 , grew up in the projects of tampa 's riverview terrace .	when he was 5 years old , he stood in his front yard and witnessed his father 's death , when the boyfriend of an older sister shot him during an argument .	when he was a 14-year-old linebacker , he sacked a quarterback who suffered a serious neck injury on the play , and jacobs asked to switch to offense so he would n't have to tackle anybody again .	when he was 21 , he convinced his troubled twin brother herbert to leave tampa and move in with him in johnson city , tennessee , where he was on a football scholarship .	the night before herbert was to depart , he was shot to death during a drug-related dispute .	when jacobs went to the sideline after he was hit by buoniconti and heard from a trainer that buoniconti was paralyzed , any reservoir of resiliency within him was sucked dry . "	i do n't remember the rest of the game , " said jacobs , who visited buoniconti at the hospital , where buoniconti 's brother confirmed the grim prognosis . "	i was caught in a downward spiral from that moment onward . "	jacobs speaks more in the manner of a poet than an ex-football star .	like buoniconti , he was undersized but had nfl aspirations .	after buoniconti 's injury , jacobs said he never played with the same intensity .	scouts tested him and invited him to the league combine , but he did n't go , instead sinking into an anonymous , mechanized routine , emotionally numb .	while buoniconti overcame his initial struggle with depression , jacobs could not . "	for 20 years i punished myself , " he said . "	i felt like i was to blame .	i felt like everybody hated me , especially marc and his family . "	he did n't finish his degree .	he tried playing semi-pro football but when he had to make a tackle on an interception he realized he had no desire for contact .	he worked for johnson city 's parks and recreation , wendy 's , waffle house , pal 's . "	i stopped smiling , lost my friends , went through a failed marriage , " he said . "	i just pushed people away , could n't seem to do anything right .	it 's like i was searching in the dark . "	by 2007 , buoniconti had reconciled with the citadel , years after he had sued the school .	buoniconti 's jersey was retired and he received a graduation ring .	but he had n't forgotten about jacobs , and sought him out , and invited him to a citadel football reunion .	when they met in charleston , s.c. , they cried .	buoniconti realized the depth of jacobs ' sorrow . "	i told herman flat out , ' this is not your fault , you were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time , ' " buoniconti said .	buoniconti asked jacobs what he wanted to do with his life . "	no one had ever asked me that question , " jacobs said . "	my mother and grandmother taught me to love cooking .	i told him i wanted to be a chef . "	buoniconti , who is described as " a man in constant motion " by miami project spokesman scott roy , pulled jacobs out of his rut , helped him enroll at johnson and wales university in north miami and invited him to be his roommate at his grove condo . "	marc allowed me to heal and start over at age 44 , " jacobs said . "	if not for him , i might be living on the street . "	when buoniconti 's nurse had a heart attack , jacobs took over the tasks of lifting , feeding and cleaning buoniconti . "	unless you see a quadriplegic 's life first-hand , you ca n't understand how difficult it is , " jacobs said . "	it takes three hours just to get marc up and going in the morning .	living with marc , living by his example , watching him interact with patients -- he motivated me . "	the two enjoyed going to football games , attending miami project events , eating out , hanging out with buoniconti 's family members .	jacobs worked at norman 's 180 , epicure , the westin colonnade , red fish grill and jaguar before moving back to tampa to take care of his mother .	he 's manager of a pdq restaurant and remarried in march .	jacobs ' reawakening affirmed buoniconti 's faith in his role , even amid his own tribulations .	last year , after complications from gall bladder surgery , he was in intensive care for 40 days . "	sometimes i say , ' wow , it 's been 30 years of a remarkable evolution , ' and sometimes i say , ' oh , my god , it 's been 30 years in a wheelchair , ' " buoniconti said . "	i try to focus on the difference i 've made in people 's lives , which is the greatest gift you can give . "	jacobs was one he inspired to rise up and move forward . "	i keep my mind on that date , " jacobs said . "	love and friendship grew out of something that could have killed us both . "
a federal appeals court has ruled that a policeman acted illegally when he obtained a lexington man 's cellphone containing nude photographs of a teenager .	according to an account in court records , on october 21 , 2007 , the guardian of the unnamed 14-year-old girl told police that frankie joe little had taken photographs of the teenager in his mobile home while the girl was lying naked on his bed .	lexington police lt. michael harper , who knew little , found the man at little 's mother 's home and asked him to come to the police station .	when little went to get a shirt , harper followed him inside where he took possession of little 's cellphone .	it was later found to contain the photographs .	little pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation of a minor and was given a 15-year sentence with another eight years of supervised release .	on appeal little argued that the cellphone photos should have been suppressed as evidence because they were obtained illegally .	the federal district court in memphis denied his claim , ruling that little had implicitly consented to harper 's entering the home by not objecting to it .	on monday , a panel of the sixth circuit court of appeals in cincinnati overturned that decision , ruling that harper 's entry into the home violated little 's fourth amendment rights .	that means the cellphone pictures that were seized as a result of the illegal entry can not be used against little . "	had officer harper asked for permission to enter and had defendant behaved in the same manner , we would have no difficulty affirming the district court 's finding of implied consent , " the panel wrote . "	unfortunately , harper neglected to do so and logic dictates that a person can not consent to a request that has not been made . "	little 's attorney , robert brooks , said he was pleased with the ruling and did n't expect it to be appealed further by the government .	if it is not , the case will be remanded back to the trial court and the prosecutor will have to decide whether to try little again , brooks said .	assistant u.s. district attorney for the western district of tennessee dan newsom did not immediately return a call for comment .
mississippi gov. haley barbour said tuesday that oil from a gushing undersea well in the gulf of mexico is hitting the state for the first time .	barbour said a two-mile long , three-foot wide strand of caramel-colored oil was found tuesday morning on petit bois island , a barrier island near the mississippi-alabama border .	the discovery means louisiana , alabama and mississippi have all been hit by oil .	barbour said vessels will be dispatched to clean up the oil , which is about 35 miles off mississippi 's coastline .	barbour said officials believe the strand broke off a patch of oil sunday south of nearby horn island . "	this no reason for anybody to panic , but it is a reason for everybody to remember that there 's the likelihood there will be more intrusion in some form of depleted oil , tar balls , tar mats , emulsified oil that 's going to reach the barrier islands , " barbour said .	barbour said additional vessels will be used to gather and absorb oil .	he also said flyovers will increase to monitor the oil as it creeps into mississippi .	six weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion , bp has failed to plug the leak after several attempts .	the spill has already leaked between 20 million and 44 million gallons , according to government estimates .	barbour said the patch of oil should have been spotted monday but was n't ?	likely because it was beneath the surface of the water .	barbour said there 's no evidence of oil in the mississippi sound , between the barrier islands and the state 's main coastline .	while he acknowledged that more oil will likely appear in state waters , he tried to assuage concerns about a catastrophic impact to the region 's tourism and industry .	a northrop grumman shipyard in pascagoula , the state port at gulfport , a chevron corp. refinery in pascagoula and numerous casinos make up the bulk of the region 's economy . "	none of them have had any problem operating , even though many of the vessels that call on them come through the gulf of mexico , " barbour said . "	i do n't want y' all to jump to conclusions that the port is about to close or the beaches are in danger .	we are ready to fight this fight . "	bill glenn , a spokesman for northrop grumman , said the shipbuilder has set a 24-hour watch and established a response team at the pascagoula facility . "	northrop grumman shipbuilding 's main objective is to proactively protect our property and u.s. navy ships under construction from contamination that may result from the oil spill , " glenn said in an e-mail .	don allee , executive director of the port of gulfport , said port operations have n't been disrupted and there have been no reports of vessel contamination .	the oil spill , however , had affected tourism with cancellations " at a record pace , " barbour said .

the questions on the ads are n't subtle : leaving islam ?	fatwa on your head ?	is your family threatening you ?	a conservative activist and the organizations she leads have paid several thousand dollars for the ads to run on at least 30 city buses for a month .	the ads point to a website called refugefromislam.com , which offers information to those wishing to leave islam , but some muslims are calling the ads a smoke screen for an anti-muslim agenda .	pamela geller , who leads an organization called stop islamization of america , said the ads were meant to help provide resources for muslims who are fearful of leaving the faith . "	it 's not offensive to muslims , it 's religious freedom , " she said . "	it 's not targeted at practicing muslims .	it does n't say ' leave , ' it says ' leaving ' with a question mark . "	she said the ad buy cost about $ 8,000 , contributed by the readers of her blog , atlas shrugs , and other websites .	similar ads have run on buses in miami , and she said ad buys were planned for other cities .	faiza ali , of the new york chapter of the council on american-islamic relations , said the ads were based on a false premise that people face coercion to remain with islam .	she said muslims believe faith that is forced is not true belief . "	geller is free to say what she likes just as concerned community members are free to criticize her motives , " ali said .	geller has a history of speaking out against muslims , and the ads are " a smoke screen to advance her long-standing history of anti-muslim bigotry , " ali said .	geller said she had no problem with muslims , but was working to " maintain the separation of mosque and state .

a visiting media delegation said thursday that press freedom has deteriorated in argentina , and accused the government of trying to reshape the media industry to control what citizens can read , see and hear .	the inter american press association group said it arrived already concerned argentina was on a dangerous path , and its worries only deepened during two days of meetings with representatives of argentina 's three branches of government , media companies and social organizations . "	without freedom of expression you ca n't have a true democracy , " warned gonzalo marroquin , iapa 's president who publishes the newspaper siglo 21 in guatemala .	concluding its trip , the delegation said a complete report would be released next week , but its preliminary conclusion is that argentina 's freedoms are endangered by a constant state of conflict polarizing society .	the problem will only become worse if a media reform law passed by congress last year is upheld in court , the group predicted .	public communications secretary juan manuel abal medina met with the group wednesday , asserting that president cristina fernandez is committed to defending free expression .	he accusing the nation 's dominant media company , grupo clarin , of posing a greater danger to free speech by stifling its competitors and using its outlets to attack the populist government .	it 's an argument widely heard in argentina , but the delegation dismissed it . "	any journalist understands that the dimension and the action of a repressive government must be criticized when it goes against freedom of expression and freedom of the press .	the damage that a government can cause to freedom of expression is n't comparable to the damage that a media company can cause , " marroquin said .	the visitors also said " advocacy journalists " use government subsidies to spread attacks on opposition media ?	part of what they see as a comprehensive , long-term strategy by president cristina fernandez 's government to control what is shown on tv and in newspapers .	the unequal distribution of government advertising to reward and punish media companies based on their support of the government is particularly worrisome , as is a proposed law that would give the government control over the production and distribution of newsprint , the delegation said .	currently , the companies that own argentina 's two leading dailies , clarin and la nacion , control the country 's only domestic source of newsprint .	the iapa group said it also heard media complaints about union efforts to keep newspapers from leaving printing plants ?	a problem it said the government denied having anything to do with ?	and accused the government of using the courts to attack the media .	several reporters raised complaints that cablevision ?	argentina 's largest cable tv provider , owned by grupo clarin ?	has refused to comply with the media reform law congress passed last year , which among other things requires it to include state-sponsored channels in its programming .	the company has denied requests to offer viewers paka paka , a homegrown argentine children 's television channel , and incaa , which promotes argentine films .	a delegation member , claudio paolillo of the uruguayan magazine busqueda , rejected the argument that such refusals limit the freedoms of argentines who have only one cable tv provider to choose from . "	freedom of the press means not only being able to publish what you want , but also to not publish what you do n't want , " paolillo said .	marroquin acknowledged that media monopolies also can pose dangers .	but he said argentina 's media reform law is ominous because if it forces the breakup of powerful media companies , argentines will be left without the voices most able to stand up to government , no matter what its ideology . "	this law wo n't just eliminate a concentration of media companies .	it will create another concentration , and that worries us a great deal because we have seen many newspapers here subsidized by official publicity , " marroquin said .	the delegation also included robert rivard , editor of the san antonio express-news in texas ; maria elvira dominguez of colombia 's el pais newspaper ; and julio e. munoz and ricardo trotti , executives of the miami-based iapa .

natchez leaders now have a chance to shape and mold the future of the city clerk 's office by appointing the person who controls the city 's finances .	but who that person will be , what qualifications city leaders will require of the position and how the clerk is compensated will all be decided in the coming months .	the mississippi state attorney general 's office approved a proposed change to the city 's charter that would allow the city clerk position to go from an elected to an appointed one .	the natchez board of aldermen moved to make the proposed change in august , more than a year after it was first suggested when board members said the change would allow them to require higher standards of the city clerk 's office .	city clerk donnie holloway has already said he did not have plans to run again in 2016 .	after serving 12 years in the position , holloway was re-elected as city clerk in 2012 .	holloway tells the natchez democrat ( http://bit.ly/1urupdw ) he plans to serve out his term .	changing the city 's charter required approval from the governor and the state attorney general , which city attorney hyde carby said he received earlier this week .	while each member of the board might differ on exactly what they hope to see in that position right now , they all agree that having someone in the office before holloway leaves would be ideal .	alderwoman joyce arceneaux-mathis said she thinks a new clerk should be appointed by no later than late spring 2016 .

the old sign near its border that proclaims the upstate new york town of whitehall to be the birthplace of the u.s. navy is a bit worn out , town clerk elaine jones admits .	residents of several other northeast towns might describe it another way : not true .	five communities claim to be the navy 's birthplace , from a wealthy former fishing hub north of boston to whitehall , a town about 200 miles from the nearest ocean .	on the navy 's official birthday wednesday ?	its 235th ?	the archivist of the united states , david ferriero , may try to settle the question at a meeting in boston at the museum of the uss constitution , the country 's oldest commissioned naval warship .	ferriero will bring documents from the national archives that detail the claims of the parade of communities asserting navy paternity , which also include marblehead and beverly , mass. ; philadelphia and providence , r.i. .	but will he rule on the location of the navy 's true birthplace ?	ferriero says only , " we 'll see . "	there are questions about ferriero 's impartiality .	he grew up in beverly .	ferriero , who 's married to a woman from another claimant ?	marblehead ?	would n't say last week if he 's already leaning one way or another . "	no comment , " he said with a laugh .	whatever ferriero rules , it likely wo n't prompt other navy birthplaces to gracefully give way . "	it wo n't matter to marbleheaders , we know what 's right , " said karen macinnis , curator of the marblehead museum .	ferriero set his staff researching the navy 's origins shortly after he was appointed the archivist last year .	curiosity about the competing claims to his hometown 's title was one reason , he said , but he added the real purpose is not to settle the argument .	rather it 's to use the good-natured debate to send a message about the archives : " these are your records , you should be using them , we provide access to them and there are all kinds of stories to be told from the records of your government , " ferriero said .	the claims of beverly and marblehead revolve around the same schooner , the hannah .	in september 1775 , it became the first vessel that george washington , commander of the continental army , ordered outfitted as a warship , for the purposes of harassing british supply vessels .	the hannah was modified and launched in beverly , which are the basis of that city 's claim .	but to people in marblehead , an old-time fishing port now known as a monied enclave , those are just details .	macinnis notes the hannah was owned and manned by marblehead residents . "	it was marblehead men and marblehead ownership , and there endeth the story , " macinnis said .	not to the people of whitehall , n.y. , a small town along lake champlain and three states due west of the ocean .	under the command of benedict arnold , several naval vessels were built in present-day whitehall in the summer of 1776 and they were later used that year in an important early war battle on the lake . "	we built the ship ( s ) and you ca n't sail unless you got one , " jones said .	the u.s. congress officially declared whitehall the navy 's birthplace in 1965 .	jones said another community can try to wrest away the title , but predicted they 'll have the same success as those who 've tried to knock down another one of the community 's claims to fame : that bigfoot has been sighted there several times . "	some things are indisputable , you know ? "	jones said . "	how are you going to claim it 's not true ? "	valdine c. atwood , a historian in machias , maine , takes the opposite approach , disavowing that the town is the navy 's birthplace , though the title 's been foisted on the community several times and it 's one of the places the archivist is investigating . "	you know what happens , " she said , explaining the misunderstanding . "	anything gets printed in the newspaper by anybody that does n't know anything and then it becomes gospel . "	in fact , atwood said , machias was the site of the first naval battle of the american revolution in june 1776 , after several woodsmen refused to hand over their lumber to a british commander , lt. james moor , in exchange for badly needed supplies .	the woodsmen later commandeered a vessel and attacked his ship , seizing the supplies and killing moor .	no cannon fire accompanies providence , r.i. , 's claim to cradle of the navy .	the city just points out its residents were the first to call for the establishment of a navy .	but lee arnold , library director at the historical society of pennsylvania in philadelphia , notes that his city is the place where the continental navy was actually established on oct. 13 , 1775 , by the continental congress , which resolved that day to build two armed vessels .	to arnold , it 's a bulletproof basis for philadelphia 's claim .	with the navy recognizing its own birthday as oct. 13 , 1775 , it would seem it also sides with arnold .	but the navy has taken a diplomatic tack on its website , summing up the various claims , saying each " unquestionably " deserves recognition and concluding blandly , " perhaps it would be historically accurate to say that america 's navy had many ' birthplaces . ' "	arnold does n't buy it . "	it 's philadelphia , " he said . "	case closed . "	he also has a lighthearted suggestion for those who disagree , and it 's tough to do at sea : " go take a hike . "
mario armond zamparelli , an internationally renowned artist who for nearly 20 years created the distinctive , often colorful logos , images and posters for reclusive billionaire howard hughes ' many companies , has died at age 91 .	zamparelli , who had homes in the los angeles suburbs of la canada-flintridge and san marino , died saturday of heart failure , his family said .	the artist , who worked in numerous styles and forms , was an illustrator for major magazines and movie posters in the early 1950s when hughes came looking for someone to design posters for his rko pictures ' movies .	he told his aides to find posters done by people they believed were the best in the business . "	he pointed straight at my dad 's poster and said , ' get me that one , ' " the artist 's daughter gina zamparelli said monday .	what followed was an association between the artist and the increasingly reclusive billionaire that continued until hughes ' death in 1976 .	during that time , and for a few years afterward , zamparelli created numerous logos , images and designs for such companies as twa , hughes helicopters , hughes aircraft , the summa corporation and the howard hughes medical institute .	among the most instantly recognizable were the bright yellow , mini-skirted uniforms he designed for the female flight attendants hughes airwest employed in the 1970s .	he also created that airline 's signature nameplate , which featured bright blue lettering placed against a bright yellow background on every plane .	as a painter , zamparelli created the only portrait of hughes that the billionaire is believed to have sat for .	gina zamparelli said hughes gave her father just two days to get it done , telling him he would never sit still for a portrait again . "	we still have some of the sketches , " she said , adding they contain the words " ok " and " not ok " next to various parts that hughes did and did n't like .	although hughes grew increasingly reclusive over the years , zamparelli never spoke ill of the billionaire . "	he was a gentleman , a real professional , and he had a marvelous sense of humor , " zamparelli told the los angeles times in a 1981 interview .	he also recalled how hughes had first recruited him , summoning him through intermediaries to california from his home in new york for a series of small assignments for a mystery client .	it was n't until two months later that he was finally summoned for a meeting with that client and discovered it was hughes .	he eventually went from designing posters for films such as " son of sinbad " to being hughes ' chief executive designer .	in that latter role , he oversaw the appearance of everything on both the inside and outside of hughes ' fleet of airplanes , as well as his frontier hotel , desert inn , sands and tropicana casinos in las vegas .	he also came to be close friends with the billionaire , although he told the times in that 1981 interview that the last time he saw hughes face-to-face was in 1958 .	before that , zamparelli 's daughter said , it was n't unusual for hughes to drop by her father 's house unannounced in the middle of the night , sometimes with a movie star such as jane russell in tow , just to talk over ideas or invite the artist to join him for a night on the town .	in addition to working for hughes , zamparelli also created images and designs for numerous other companies over the years .	later in life , he returned to his first love of painting .	although zamparelli said he had numerous other interests as a child , including baseball , music and girls , he showed an early aptitude for painting .	when he was just 14 he had an exhibition of his watercolors in london , and he later studied at the pratt institute in new york , where he was influenced by the bauhaus movement .	also a skilled musician , who played the violin , bass and piano , zamparelli performed in an army band during world war ii .	at the time of his death he was working on a book about his years with hughes . "	he always felt there were injustices done to howard hughes , and he wanted to tell the story of someone who knew him personally as a friend , " his daughter said .	she added that the family hopes to eventually publish the manuscript , titled " enigma . "	in addition to his daughter gina , zamparelli is survived by two other children , marisa zamparelli and andrea zamparelli ; his wife , maureen hingert-zamparelli ; and brothers robert and victor zamparelli .
the mayor of the small eastern pennsylvania town of macungie says he needs access to the police department 's files so he can investigate citizen complaints about the force .	macungie 's police chief says the mayor , a civilian with no law enforcement experience , has no business looking at sensitive investigative materials or telling cops how to do their jobs .	their dispute has landed in a state appeals court , and the outcome could have a ripple effect on hundreds of pennsylvania boroughs .	at issue is the balance of power between mayors and the police departments they oversee .	a 1966 state law gives the mayor control of the police .	but the law has spawned questions through the years about who 's exactly responsible for what and created power struggles between small-town mayors and police departments .

lisa hulber gazes affectionately at her dog , effie .	she 's always had a bond with the mixed breed , but the two have grown even closer this past year .	effie , or effie mae as lisa and her husband , scott , sometimes call her , saved the 50-year-old port huron resident 's life .

"	i went and had another mammogram , and there was nothing and then we had an ultrasound and we found a tumor . "	after a ... biopsy they determined it was cancer . "	the tumor was an uncommon cancer called invasive lobular carcinoma .	it had spread from her right breast to the lymph node in her left armpit . "	that kind of cancer is notorious for not showing up on a mammogram , " dr. timothy cox , a medical oncologist at blue water oncology in port huron said . "	instead of the most common kind of breast cancer that forms a lump , this forms a thickening of the tissues . "	he said most authorities recommend women start getting mammograms at the age of 40 .	he said there is some debate about whether women between 40 and 50 should receive annual mammograms . "	if it was my wife i would be doing it yearly , " he said .	a study in august at a hospital in germany with four specially-trained dogs , two german shepherds , a labrador retriever and an australian shepherd , found they were able to detect lung cancer .	dogs also have been trained to detect low blood sugar in children with type 1 diabetes .	hulber said effie has a " good nose , " but she wo n't play fetch .	she is , however , a bit of ham .	point your finger at her and shout " bang !

"	she actually is a rescue dog , " hulber said . "	i got her , i started volunteering for last day dog rescue ( based in livonia ) , and i would take mamas and their puppies .	she was a mama with seven puppies .	nobody wanted her in ohio , and they were getting ready to gas her and all of her puppies .	it was a high-kill shelter . "	so we got her out and i started fostering her , " hulber said . "	i got all of her puppies adopted out , but her , she had some issues .	she dug holes in the yard , she used to cower around men , she would growl at children , she was just completely unadoptable , nobody would want her . "	so we worked it out with last day dog rescue , and me and my husband kept her and she 's actually turned out to be a great dog .	i mean , i rescued her and she rescued me . "	hulber has been through a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and is about to start radiation therapy . "	my prognosis is good , " she said . "	yeah , my oncologist says 75 percent , but through the research i 've done if i could go through the radiation and chemotherapy and do everything by the book i actually have as good as a 93 percent chance .

but then , " the angels sang and the heavens opened , " and nelson , a preschool teacher from duluth , ga. , branched out to coupon sites such as livingsocial , joining the millions who scour hundreds of such places in search of everything from pizzas to pedicures at 50 ( percent ) to 90 ( percent ) off .	her haul among the close to 100 deals she has amassed so far includes $ 4 movie tickets , three cases of martha stewart sample paint ( $ 4 a case , plus free shipping ) and helicopter flying lessons for one of her sons ( $ 159 for two vs. $ 189 each ) .	coming up is a facial and massage as a treat for her wedding anniversary .	but these days -- when an ad for daily-deal titan groupon teases , " all your savvy friends are paying half " -- " do you really need an excuse ( to splurge ) ? "	asks nelson , 57 . "	it might be flag day . "	the coupon is cool , having shed its stigma thanks to the rise of sites including groupon , livingsocial , thrillist and lifebooker , which lure bargain hunters with often achingly cheeky ads ( in search of an off-price gynecology exam ? "	look out below ! " ) .	also helping is the popularity of the tlc show extreme couponing , which wraps its first season june 15 .	twentysomethings use them , as do relatively wealthy people -- and guys .	iphones are checked first thing in the morning for the day 's discounts .	romances are kindled over daily-deal restaurant dates , often at pricey places couples could n't otherwise afford .	vacations and honeymoons are planned around boutique hotels and unique activities dug up from daily-deal sites .	christmas lists get ticked off thanks to clicking , not clipping .	and with no flipping or snipping required , the modern coupon is relatively hassle - and pain-free : instead of subjecting themselves to ink-stained and paper-cut fingers , today 's discount devotees merely need to flash an image of their purchased deal from their droid x. " no matter how much money you make , you always love a great deal , " says doug clinton , a research analyst who tracks the daily-deal industry for piper jaffray , an investment bank . "	there 's not a stigma attached to pulling out a groupon vs. pulling out a coupon you clipped from the newspaper .	that makes you look totally out of touch . "	student mind-set lingers newlywed manhattanites rachel and jeff behm regularly turn to daily deals for date nights , such as the byob painting class they scored last september through livingsocial ( $ 22 each , down from $ 45 ) .

"	maybe it 's our midwestern roots or sense of value , " he says .	clinton has another idea : daily-deal shopping is " just kind of the normal now .	it 's the new every day . "	as another groupon ad asks : " why are you still paying full price ? "	the site 's 83.1 million first-quarter subscribers , up from 3.4 million a year earlier , sure are n't .	livingsocial 's 28 million members -- up from 120,000 in january 2010 -- are " very desirable , " says the company 's communications director , maire griffin : 51 ( percent ) are younger than 35 , 50 ( percent ) are college graduates ( 28 ( percent ) have grad school on their r?sum?s ) , 30 ( percent ) are men , and 38 ( percent ) boast household incomes of $ 100,000-plus -- more than any other income category .	the 2 million users of 8coupons , which aggregates offers from 300 daily-deal sites , consist of " single ( 60 ( percent ) to 65 ( percent ) ) , mainly urban dwellers with a lot of disposable income looking for stuff to do , " says ceo landy ung .	the average age is 18 to 40 .	the average income is $ 65,000 to $ 100,000 .	and there are 8coupon kings as well as queens : 35 ( percent ) of users are male .

"	it takes away the guilt of spoiling yourself .	and maybe that 's what ( daily-deal sites are ) tapping into here at the end of the recession . "	role models on tv three years ago , couponmom had 180,000 members ; now it has 4 million . "	the recession got people to think more about being smart about their money , " nelson says . "	more people are using coupons , even if their economic situation has improved over the past couple of years . "	nelson is convinced that what 's also driving the droves to her site is the ( relatively ) extreme success of extreme couponing , which has averaged 1.9 million viewers per episode ( most tlc shows average about half that ) and was just renewed for a second season that will premiere this fall . "	we 're really thrilled with how it 's done , " says network general manager amy winter .	even if the effect of the recession on households is easing , " everyone is coming out of this a little wiser than they were going in , and it 's just incredible to watch people who have learned from it and are benefiting from what was a downturn in the economy . "	winter calls the toothpaste-and-tuna stockpilers the show profiles " models .	i think they 're inspirational .	among the show 's audience , there 's " rabid interest in getting tips " from the stars via their blogs , websites and facebook pages , winter says .	no matter that some viewers thought that one of them , tarin perry , was crazy for buying a wall 's worth of diapers ( $ 2.50 for a package of 32 to 35 ) before she was even pregnant .	because she and her husband plan to have kids this year , " we 're stocking up .	i buy before i need it , " explains perry , 31 , a chicago banker whose 24-year-old couponing skills ( she got her start under her mom 's tutelage with two-hour sunday clipping sessions after church ) were featured in the show , along with those of her twin sister , tai .	not surprisingly , the perrys were early adopters of the groupon phenomenon .	soon , discount bowling outings and a handy $ 13 subscription to the coupon-crammed sunday chicago tribune led to an inundated inbox .	with 20 to 30 deals a day , " it was too much , " tai perry says .

a sweeping bill that would effectively shut down most abortion clinics across the nation 's second most-populous state has stalled in the texas senate , and a democratic filibuster that will only need to last a seemingly manageable 13 hours tuesday looks like it will be enough to talk the hotly contested measure to death .	after thwarting two attempts monday by majority republicans to bring the abortion bill to a floor vote ahead of its scheduled time tuesday morning , democrats are turning to sen. wendy davis , d-fort worth , to stage the marathon speech . "	we want to do whatever we can for women in this state , " said sen. kirk watson of austin , leader of the senate democrats .	the bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics that perform the procedure to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers .	also , doctors would be required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles ?	a tall order in rural communities .	although texas is just the latest of several conservative states to try to enact tough limits on abortions , the scope of its effort is notable because of the combination of bills being considered and the size of the state .	when combined in a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long and with 26 million people , the measures would become the most stringent set of laws to impact the largest number of people in the nation . "	if this passes , abortion would be virtually banned in the state of texas , and many women could be forced to resort to dangerous and unsafe measures , " said cecile richards , president of planned parenthood action fund and daughter of the late former texas governor ann richards .	outnumbered 19-11 ?	with san antonio sen. leticia van de putte missing to attend the funeral of her father , who died last week in a car crash ?	senate democrats held firm monday to their razor-thin margin of a single vote to block the bill from moving forward .	that 's key since the 30-day special legislative session ends at midnight tuesday , meaning the filibuster democrats have promised only needs to last the better part of one day , instead of two .	davis gave a filibuster at the end of the 2011 session to temporarily block $ 5.4 billion cuts to public schools , and said she was preparing for her upcoming speech but refused to say exactly how .	she will have to speak nonstop , remain standing , refrain from bathroom breaks or even leaning on anything .	other democrats can give her voice a break by offering questions to keep conversation moving . "	democrats chose not to negotiate , and we could not get the block undone , " said lt. gov. david dewhurst , a republican who controls the flow of senate legislation .	he refused to declare the issue dead ?	but others were less optimistic .	sen. dan patrick , r-houston , said the democrats never should have been allowed to put republicans " in a box " and complained that many in the senate gop were " flying by the seat of their pants . "	but the bill 's bogging down began with gov. rick perry , who summoned lawmakers back to work immediately after the regular legislative session ended may 27 , but did n't add abortion to the special session to-do list until late in the process .	the legislature can only take up issues at the governor 's direction during the extra session .	then , house democrats succeeded in stalling nearly all night sunday , keeping the bill from reaching the senate until 11 a.m. monday .	the measure only passed the lower chamber after a raucous debate that saw more than 800 women 's rights activists pack the public gallery and surrounding capitol , imploring lawmakers not to approve it .	while supporters say it will protect women 's health , abortion rights groups warn the practical effect of the bill would be to shutter most abortion providers statewide ?	making it very difficult for texas women to have the procedure .	debate ranged from lawmakers waving coat-hangers on the floor and claiming the new rules are so draconian that women are going to be forced to head to drug war-torn mexico to have abortions , to the bill 's sponsor , republican rep. jodie laubenberg of spring , errantly suggesting that emergency room rape kits could be used to terminate pregnancies .	in the end , though , the bill passed by more than 60 votes as republicans and some conservative democrats approved it .	still , legislature rules prohibit the senate from taking up a bill for 24 hours after it clears the house .	republicans struggled to find a way to break the democratic roadblock , but the vote swung monday on sen. eddie lucio , a brownsville democrat who voted for the abortion bill when it first passed the senate a week ago but pledged not to approve suspending the rule with republicans unless van de putte was able to make it to the chamber .	she did n't show and lucio voted with his party , despite his support for the bill .	if the abortion restrictions go down , other measures could fall with it .	a proposal to fund major transportation projects as well as a bill to have texas more closely conform with a recent u.s. supreme court decision banning mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole for offenders younger than 18 might not get votes .	current state law only allows a life sentence without parole for 17-year-olds convicted of capital murder .	watson said democrats are willing to pass the transportation and 17-year-old sentencing measures but wo n't budge on abortion . "	let 's get those up , let 's get those out of here , " watson said . "	let 's not make these victims of red-meat politics . "	patrick said that if the filibuster succeeds , he hopes perry will summon lawmakers back for a second or even third special session . "	if the majority ca n't pass the legislation that they believe is important and the people believe is important , " he said , " than that 's of great concern to me . "

iowa chief justice mark cady says the supreme court has weathered the storm created when voters ousted three justices because of a decision legalizing same-sex marriage .	speaking friday on the iowa public television program , " iowa press , " cady argued the court has emerged as a stronger institution since voters removed the justices in 2010 after a campaign focused on their ruling that legalized gay marriage .	cady says justices have tried to make their work more visible to the public by hearing cases throughout iowa .	he says that lets people understand court operations and how justices reach their conclusions .	he does say the court is still struggling with a backload of cases because many had to be argued again when the makeup of the court was changed .
campaign finance reports show nevada gov. jim gibbons is working with a slim campaign budget in his uphill re-election effort .	the embattled republican incumbent reported just $ 179,000 in contributions and $ 184,000 in paid expenses since january , according to the report filed late wednesday with the secretary of state 's office .	his contributions fall far short of republican brian sandoval , whose campaign said it raised nearly $ 1 million in the same period .	sandoval 's report had not yet been received by the secretary of state 's office .	sandoval , 46 , is a former federal judge who resigned his lifetime appointment in september to run for nevada 's highest office .	he reported amassing nearly $ 1 million in his first three months as a candidate .	democratic front-runner rory reid reported raising almost $ 1 million during the latest reporting period .	campaign reports show he 's raised a combined $ 4.4 million for the race .	the primary is set for tuesday , with the winners facing off in november .	gibbons , 65 , reported raising $ 165,000 during all of last year .	in contrast , gibbons raised about $ 6 million for his first election four years ago .	gibbons was hurt by a tumultuous first term that included a nasty public divorce and allegations of infidelity .	the state 's political power brokers abandoned him , and strategists recruited sandoval to challenge gibbons for the nomination .	recent polls have gibbons trailing sandoval by double digits .	in his filing , former north las vegas mayor mike montandon , who also is seeking the republican nod , reported $ 80,000 in contributions , including a $ 20,000 loan to himself .	he listed $ 114,000 in expenses .	montandon , who has been running a distant third in the polls , had $ 306,000 in contributions and $ 274,000 in expenses last year .
a virginia-based company that is among the largest coal miners in wyoming 's powder river basin has been informed it no longer meets the state 's self-bonding requirements , which could mean it will have to come up with millions in three months to cover any cleanup obligations here .	in a statement issued friday , alpha natural resources disagreed with the state 's assessment and said it is working to have the decision changed , the casper star-tribune ( http://tinyurl.com/pejdf8w ) newspaper reported .	self-bonding status allows a mining company to agree to pay for future cleanup costs associated with its operations without putting down collateral , provided it meets certain financial criteria .	without self-bonding , alpha would need to post $ 411 million in 90 days in the form of corporate surety bonds , government securities or cash to keep operating in wyoming .	wyoming regulators said alpha failed to meet at least one of four criteria needed to qualify for self-bonding status , though they declined to name which one .	the four are : a tangible net worth of at least $ 10 million ; a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times or fewer ; a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater ; and a bonding amount not to exceed 25 percent of the company 's net worth .	shannon anderson , a lawyer at the powder river basin resource council , a sheridan-based landowners group , said the department of environmental quality was doing its due diligence in the alpha case , but she believes the self-bonding program needs to be examined . "	we think that with the state of the coal industry it is time for a big-picture look at this program and whether it protects the public interest , " anderson said .	keith guille , a spokesman for the department of environmental quality , said the alpha decision shows the rules work .	guille added that an audit of the self-bonding program was conducted in february and identified no issues with its operations .	talk of reform is for policymakers to debate , he added . "	we follow the rules that are set forth , " guille said .	alpha 's belle ayr and eagle butte mines in wyoming produced a combined 36 million tons of coal last year , ranking them among the largest mines in the nation .	the two mines employed a combined 585 people at the end of 2014 , according to federal statistics .	alpha was the 11th-largest taxpayer in wyoming in 2013 , according to the most recently available state statistics , paying about $ 384 million in production taxes .

u.s. sen. lisa murkowski has asked for a " full review " of the arrest of a 70-year-old alaska man whose lawyer claims national park service rangers went a little overboard on a boat safety stop .	in a letter to national park service director jonathon jarvis , murkowski asked for an explanation about why jim wilde was stopped and arrested following what park service officials said began as a routine boat safety inspection .	his attorney , bill satterberg , told the fairbanks daily news-miner that " badge-heavy park rangers " flagged down wilde for a boat safety inspection on the yukon river , then " roughed him up " and pointed a shotgun at him .	satterberg said wilde told the two rangers it was unsafe to board his boat in the middle of the river and said he would go ashore with his passengers ?	his wife , hannelore , 73 , and their friend , fred shank ?	and meet them . "	nobody boards each other on the yukon river , " satterberg said .	the trio had been boating up the yukon river near woodchopper creek , downriver from eagle , while hunting thursday , when the two rangers approached .	satterberg said the park rangers followed wilde as he motored to shore , with one pointing a shotgun at him .	after reaching shore , wilde was anchoring his boat when " the next thing you know he was knocked to the ground , " satterberg said . "	they roughed him up a little bit by rolling him around in the mud . "	wilde has pleaded not guilty to four misdemeanors : interfering with agency function , violating a lawful order , disorderly conduct and operating an unregistered boat .	each charge is punishable by six months in jail , a $ 5,000 fine , or both .	satterberg described wilde as " a classic , old , crusty alaskan " who will have his day in court .	assistant u.s. attorney stephen cooper told the daily news-miner he could not elaborate on any details of the case because he was " strictly limited to the public record . "	according to the charges cooper filed against wilde in federal court in fairbanks , wilde threatened , resisted , intimidated and intentionally interfered with a park ranger during an official duty ; fled when he was ordered to halt ; and recklessly created " a risk of public nuisance and violence by engaging in threatening and violent behavior in the form of maneuvering his boat toward the path of a law enforcement vessel , and in other ways . "	murkowski issued a news release tuesday calling the circumstances of the arrest " questionable " and the behavior of the arresting officers as " provocative . " "	the initial reports i 've received indicate that park service personnel overreacted in this case , " said murkowski , who is involved in a campaign to keep her seat in the nov. 2 election . "	this incident calls for a full review of exactly what happened . "	national park service spokesman john quinley declined to discuss any details about the incident .

tony hayward , who became the face of bp 's flailing efforts to contain the massive gulf oil spill , will step down as chief executive in october and be offered a job with the company 's joint venture in russia , a person familiar with the matter said monday .	the person spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement had not been made by the british company 's board , which was meeting monday in london to decide hayward 's fate .	it 's not yet clear what hayward 's role will be with tnk-bp .	bp owns half of the oil firm , which is russia 's third-largest .	it was once run by american bob dudley , now the odds-on favorite to replace hayward as bp ceo .	after hayward made a series of missteps , including telling reporters he wanted his life back as gulf residents struggled to deal with the spill , dudley took over as bp 's point man in dealing with it .	he was in london monday with other board members .	hayward was called back to london a month ago after a bruising encounter with a congressional committee and has since kept a low profile . "	we 're getting to the end of the situation , " said david battersby at redmayne bentley stockbrokers . "	to draw a line under it , they need a new chief executive .

basic state aid for missouri colleges will decline , while funding for public k-12 schools will remain flat , under a budget approved thursday that lawmakers described as inadequate but the best they could do given the state 's finances .	the $ 23.2 billion operating budget for next year now goes to gov. jay nixon , who can veto or reduce expenditures but can not add to them .	overall , the 2012 budget plan is about the same size as the 2011 budget approved last year , though slumping tax revenues led nixon to cut about $ 300 million from the current year 's budget .	nixon 's budget director has said the 2012 budget plan appears to be balanced , meaning sizable gubernatorial cuts are unlikely .	the plan contains no new tax increases .	even so , growth in mandatory programs such as the $ 8.4 billion medicaid health care plan for the poor meant that lawmakers had to forego increases or make reductions to other government programs and services for the budget year that begins july 1 .	missouri 's public schools will get $ 3 billion in basic aid .	that 's the same amount as the current year but about $ 180 million short of what is called for under the state 's school funding formula . "	when states around this country are cutting money that goes directly to elementary and secondary education , the state of missouri was able to keep it flat , and i think that 's the first and foremost thing we 've done in this budget , " said house budget committee chairman ryan silvey , r-kansas city . "	we did the best we can do , " added rep. mike thomson , r-maryville . "	i wish i could say we are adequately funding our education .	i ca n't say that . "	the school transportation allotment of $ 108 million , which provides funding for busing , is about $ 45 million less than what schools were supposed to get this year , but about $ 10 million more than what they actually got after nixon 's budget cuts .	for the second straight year , public colleges and universities will see a decline in basic state aid , though it will not be as large as originally proposed .	the budget plan outlined in january by nixon would have reduced their core budgets by 7 percent .	the budget approved thursday includes a roughly 5.5 percent cut . "	would we like to put more money into higher education ?	absolutely , " said rep. sara lampe of springfield , the ranking democrat on the house budget committee . "	but this state is going to have to make some decisions about how to bring money into the state before we do that . "	republican legislative leaders and the democratic governor ruled out any tax increases .	but the budget counts on some non-traditional revenue sources .	for example , missouri 's main college scholarship program depends for the second straight year on the transfer of $ 30 million from the proceeds of the missouri higher education loan authority , which services college loans from students across the country .	some lawmakers also bemoaned that the budget still relies on hundreds of millions of federal stimulus dollars , which will either have to be replaced with state dollars or counteracted with cuts in the 2013 budget . "	we 're not addressing the structural hole in our budget , we are kicking the can down the road in the hope that our economy is going to rebound , " said sen. jim lembke , r-st .	louis .	the final budget proposal backs away from some cuts that had been proposed by the senate .	for example , it continues to fund the missouri rx plan , which covers half the deductible and prescription co-payments for 226,000 low-income seniors and disabled residents enrolled in the federal medicare program .	but lawmakers will have to also pass a separate bill reauthorizing the program to continue after aug. 28 .	budget negotiators also opted against restructuring the state 's child-care subsidies for low-income parents .	the plan would have reduced payments for several thousand children in exchange for expanding eligibility to a few hundred children whose parents are transitioning to better-paying jobs .	among the cuts in the budget is a $ 1.6 million reduction in state aid to conduct property assessments , which help set a property tax base for local schools .	the cut lowers the per parcel reimbursement that county assessors receive to $ 3.41 ?	only slightly above the $ 3 minimum set forth in state law .	the budget also axes the salary of the chef at the governor 's mansion .	silvey suggested the governor could order catered meals when entertaining guests .	and the budget attempts to stop nixon from billing other state agencies for the costs of his airplane flights and staff ?	giving him a $ 200,000 travel budget and allowing him to allocate costs only to the department of public safety , which silvey said would accommodate urgent travel such as responding to natural disasters .	the budget includes a $ 1.1 million increase for the state 's oversight of dog-breeding businesses , which have been a focal-point of controversy in missouri .	voters last fall approved stringent new requirements for dog breeders , but the legislature and governor this year repealed some of the key provisions and rewrote other parts of the law .	they linked the increased funding for state inspectors and enforcement efforts to the separate legislation overhauling the voter-approved law .
authorities say a tampa bay-area sheriff 's deputy 's patrol car was struck by a drunk driver .	the hillsborough county sheriff 's office says deputy juan lazu was on patrol early sunday when a sport utility vehicle crossed the median and continued driving the wrong way .	lazu was trapped in his vehicle after the crash but called for help on his radio .	sheriff 's office spokesman larry mckinnon says deputies pulled lazu from his vehicle before it went up in flames .	mckinnon says lazu suffered minor injuries .	the suv 's driver , angel pena , was held on $ 500 bond on a charge of driving under the influence with property damage .	jail records did n't show whether pena had an attorney .	the sheriff 's office says pena smelled of alcohol at the scene but refused a breath test .

gov. ed rendell drove home his case for attacking the dire condition of the state 's highways , bridges and mass transit systems in the coming months , warning senators wednesday that inaction could mean life or death .	speaking during a state senate transportation committee hearing , rendell told lawmakers that waiting until next year to find the money to begin fixing thousands of deteriorating bridges and miles of highway would mean missing the 2011 construction season .	it also could mean trying to take action under a new governor ?	republican candidate tom corbett ?	who has pledged not to raise taxes if elected , rendell said .	rendell , a term-limited democrat who is leaving office in january , told lawmakers not to shy away from raising taxes or fees , even if it 's right before the november general election . "	our citizens understand that you get what you pay for and , in infrastructure , they 're willing to pay for it , " he said .	properly maintaining roads and bridges , rendell said , is " a matter of life and death .	it 's a matter of economic competitiveness .	it 's a matter of giving people back an hour , an hour-and-a-half of their lives by reducing congestion . "	he used tvs to show photos of crumbling bridges and roads in the districts of committee members ? "	look at that , unbelievable , " he remarked about a photo of the monocacy creek bridge in collegeville in the district of committee chairman john rafferty , r-montgomery .	of the members on the committee , senate president joe scarnati , r-jefferson , has the district with the largest number of bridges in need of repair , with 445 structurally deficient bridges traveled by 871,000 vehicles each day , rendell said .	sen. don white , r-indiana , warned that the last thing any lawmaker should do is delay action and risk a bridge collapse similar to the one in minneapolis in 2007 . "	i agree with you , i do n't want to wait another day , " white told rendell .	sen. john gordner , r-columbia , said that , in 1997 , he took criticism for voting in the house to increase taxes for transportation , but he kept his job .	still , he suggested that rendell has not spent enough time going county to county to win support . "	i do n't know that this has been sold out throughout the 67 counties and that , i think , is an issue in regard to again getting the support , " gordner said .	rendell responded he will take a five - or six-day bus trip across the state in august ?	probably his last bus trip as governor ?	and will post a list for the public to see which roads and bridges will be delayed without more money .	the committee is holding a series of hearings on transportation funding , prompted by the federal government 's rejection in april of a plan that state lawmakers approved in 2007 to add tolls to interstate 80 .	the rejection meant the loss of $ 472 million as part of $ 2.9 billion in highway and bridge improvements and $ 1.6 billion in state and federal support for mass transit in the 2010-11 budget year alone , the state department of transportation has said .	more recently , in may , the state 's transportation advisory committee said pennsylvania needs to increase spending by $ 3.5 billion a year to adequately maintain highways , bridges and transit systems .	rendell wants lawmakers to return to harrisburg in august to deal with the matter , but house and senate leaders have made no move to call the rank-and-file back before september .	meanwhile , there are no serious negotiations between top lawmakers on a funding plan .	the hearing wednesday , which drew six of the committee 's 13 members , was the third .	the series is expected to last through early september .	the house transportation committee also held a series of seven hearings in may and june .	rendell is advocating a new tax on the profits of large oil and gas companies , a plan that has garnered little traction in the legislature since he first floated it in 2007 .	however , he also has said he would n't oppose an increase in the gas tax or the various license and registration fees imposed on motorists .	rafferty has said he hopes to win passage this year of a bill to allow public-private partnerships on transportation projects .	business groups support an increase in motorist fees or gas taxes , but they also want to repeal laws that require payment of the " prevailing wage " ?	in many cases , union scale ?	that they say inflates the cost of labor on some public road maintenance and construction projects .	the state should n't look to the federal government for help ?	congress is showing no interest in raising the federal gas tax or allowing states to add tolls to federal highways , rendell said .

"	neither brown nor waters disclosed the cash to the state as a gift or a campaign donation .	it is legal for lawmakers to take cash as gifts or campaign donations , if they report it on disclosure forms and the gift is not tied to any sort of official action .	individual cash campaign donations over $ 100 are prohibited .	lawmakers convicted of a felony can not stay in office , and a bribery conviction triggers a pension forfeiture .	they were the third and fourth state lawmakers to be charged this year .	brown , 48 , was elected in 2008 .	waters , 64 , was elected in 1999 .	the investigation had been a secret until the philadelphia inquirer revealed its existence in a march report that said kane had shut it down .	in deciding to drop the case , kane , a democrat , cited concerns over racial motivation , a long dormant period , questionable tactics and a plea deal that she said was so favorable that it undermined the credibility of the informant .	williams , a democrat who now employs the sting 's lead agent and prosecutor from the attorney general 's office , has challenged kane 's criticism as unfounded .	williams and all of the targets of the investigation are black .	kane is white .	the informant , tyron b. ali , began working undercover after being arrested on charges in 2009 that he had stolen $ 430,000 in taxpayer money from a state food program for low-income children and seniors by forging bank statements , payroll records and expenses .	he had 113 meetings with various public officials and other contacts in 2010 through 2012 .	williams ' office charged another target of the sting , a former philadelphia traffic court judge , in october .	thomasine tynes was scheduled to plead guilty to perjury wednesday .	two other philadelphia lawmakers also were targets of the sting , the inquirer has reported .	at least 17 current or former state lawmakers have been charged in the past decade .

the moroccan teen at the center of the under-age prostitution scandal enveloping premier silvio berlusconi insists any damage she has suffered has been at the hands of the media ?	not the italian premier .	neither karima el-mahroug , better known as ruby , nor berlusconi were present at the opening of berlusconi 's trial wednesday on charges that he paid the teen for sex when she was under-age , and then used his influence to try to cover it up .	both have denied ever having had sex with each other ?	and ruby is n't budging from that line .	named an injured party by the prosecution , el-mahroug could have petitioned to become a civil complainant in the trial , which would have allowed her to seek monetary damages in case of conviction and also question witnesses in the case .	but , her lawyer said , it also would have been a tacit admission of the prosecutors ' allegations . "	this contrasts with what karima has always declared .	she has always said she never the object of sexual acts by premier berlusconi , and she has never made the choice to be a prostitute , " paola boccardi said .	el-mahroug does not feel that any damage she has suffered was due to berlusconi , the lawyer said . "	there is a damage , it is a damage mediatic .	karima , all over the whole world , is seen as a prostitute .	when this young woman walks down the street , well-off men , very normal men , in their 50s , stop and make fun of her , saying " bunga , bunga , " a term reportedly describing sexually charged dancing at berlusconi 's villa . "	this i find disconcerting , " boccardi said , adding that no one has ever come forward to say they had paid for sex with the teen .	in italy , prostitution is not a crime , but paying for sex with someone under 17 is since berlusconi 's own government toughened the law to raise the age of child prostitution from 16 .	ruby was 17 during the period prosecutors allege she frequented berlusconi 's villa in arcole , outside milan , accepting cash and gifts in exchange for sexual favors .	she has since turned 18 .	the underage prostitution charge carries a possible prison term of six months to three years .	the abuse of office charge ?	based on phone calls seeking el-mahroug 's release from custody for alleged theft ?	is even more dangerous : it carries a sentence of four to 12 years , and if berlusconi is sentenced to more than five years , he would be barred from ever again holding public office .	the flash hearing lasted all of seven minutes , enough time for role call and to set a new trial date for may 31 .	despite berlusconi 's absence and the procedural nature of the first hearing , more than 100 journalists packed the courtroom , where officials had draped in white cloth three huge barred cells ?	normally exposed ?	that have held defendants in domestic terror trials .	the trial opened under tight security , with dozens of police in riot gear circling the monumental fascist-era courthouse .	they were relegated mostly to keeping dozens of pro- and anti-berlusconi protesters ?	who took up positions on opposite sides of the street ?	from scuffling , or getting hit by passing traffic .	police officials who were contacted by the premier or his office the night that el-mahroug was taken into custody also have decided not to declare themselves civil complainants .	however , a woman 's right organization , arcidonna , is asking to be allowed to participate as a civil plaintiff to defend the dignity of women .	the panel of three female judges will decide at the next session whether to accept the request .	the scandal has angered ordinary italian women who protest the image of women projected by the parade of aspiring , young showgirls who frequented the premier 's residence , not to mention the bevy of beautiful women promoted into politics by berlusconi , including the minister for equal opportunity , mara carfagna , a former starlet . "	they take away the hope for our future , " said gaia rocchi , a 21-year-old studying art and cultural sciences in milan , outside the tribunal .	young women , she said , should not be made to feel they need to trade on their looks or sexuality to move ahead ?	something that is completely at odds with the reality for most italian women . "	the reality is that italian women are workers .	they work for less pay than men , and do n't get the same positions , " rocchi said , adding that if things do n't change , she will look for work abroad .	prosecutors say that el-mahroug was one of many young women who frequented raucous parties at the premier 's villa that started with dinner , progressed to erotic dancing before berlusconi would chose a sex partner .	three close berlusconi aides could also face trial separately for allegedly organizing the girls and their payments .	the teen herself acknowledged that she received ?	7,000 in cash from the premier the first time they met , on valentine 's day 2010 , but she insists it was not in exchange for sex , just an act of generosity from the premier , whose media empire has made him a billionaire .	berlusconi 's defense and political allies are trying to get the trial moved out of the milan tribunal , which the premier maintains is politically slanted against him .	they want the case transferred to the tribunal of ministers , which deals with offenses committed by public officials in the execution of their duties .	parliament on tuesday asked the country 's constitutional court to decide which body has jurisdiction .	the tribunal of ministers would need parliament 's authorization to proceed with the trial ?	something that would likely be denied in a berlusconi-controlled house .	berlusconi 's lawyer , giorgio perroni , said the defense team would decide in the coming weeks if they will seek to have the trial suspended until the higher court can rule .	the premier 's defense argues he called police officials seeking el-mahroug 's release from custody because he believed at the time that she was the niece of then-egyptian president hosni mubarak , and he wanted to avoid a diplomatic incident .	author and commentator beppe severgnini , who attended the hearing , expressed a sense of battle fatigue at the premier 's ongoing legal trials , now in their second decade . "	i was here 18 years ago .	same courthouse , same lawyers .	we are stuck , while the world is moving on , " severgnini said . "	the arab world is rising up , the british prime minister is young and the french president has married an italian .	the world changes , not italy . "	berlusconi also is defending himself in three other cases alleging tax fraud or corruption in relation to his business dealings .	in the past , he has always either been aquitted , or seen the statute of limitations expire .

a $ 24.3 billion budget proposal for next year that contains fewer cuts than lawmakers had feared but still leaves public health care programs short received passage thursday from the louisiana house .	lawmakers voted 65-37 for the spending plan to finance government operations in the fiscal year that begins july 1 , feeling a bit more upbeat about the budget situation than when they opened the legislative session in april .	after starting the legislative session with a hefty shortfall , the house passed a series of tax changes to raise more money for state coffers .	that , combined with money from improved income forecasts and other patchwork financing , would close about $ 850 million of the gap in the house version of the budget .	house leaders estimate lawmakers need another $ 150 million to address the remaining list of budget needs identified by the house and senate . "	that 's 85 percent of the issue solved by the house , " appropriations committee chairman jim fannin , r-jonesboro , who handles the budget bills in the house , said at the start of the six-hour debate .	while he acknowledged some agencies still face cuts , fannin added : " i 'm proud to say that we have kept those essential services . "	higher education , which started the legislative session facing cuts of up to 80 percent of its state financing , would be spared slashing ?	a point that won praise from university of louisiana system president sandra woodley , who thanked house members for making " extremely difficult decisions . " "	we 're not out of the woods yet , but i assure you this is encouraging news , " woodley said in a statement .	but under the budget heading to the senate for debate , cuts still would fall across public health care services , state parks , museums and agricultural services .	without additional dollars , the lsu privatization deals are $ 95 million short of what the hospital operators say they need to continue providing the current level of services to the poor and uninsured who rely on the facilities .	that figure includes $ 36 million in state financing to draw down federal matching money .	in addition , lsu 's medical schools in new orleans and shreveport would be left with $ 56 million in insurance and retiree costs from the privatization deals that medical school leaders say could leave them struggling to stay afloat .	the democratic leader in the house , rep. john bel edwards , voted against the budget bill .	he said while the house version of the budget " is so much better " than the proposal submitted by gov. bobby jindal , " it 's not good enough . "	edwards , who is running for governor this fall , cited the health care holes and the house 's rejection of his proposal to expand louisiana 's medicaid program as allowed under the federal health care law . "	the people deserve better , " he said .	lawmakers in the house added money to cover the costs of the k-12 public school financing formula , keep open a program that cares for newborn babies with severe medical conditions , and hold a presidential primary election in 2016 .	one of the largest changes made thursday involved stripping $ 26 million from the office of public health and reshuffling it to services for people with disabilities , community clinics , hemophilia programs and other items .	health and hospitals secretary kathy kliebert said the move would shut down inspections for school cafeterias , day care facilities , restaurants and water systems .	the budget would be balanced with $ 440 million in money from a tax amnesty program , one-time debt prepayment and other piecemeal funding that is n't expected to be available a year later .	that 's down from the $ 1.2 billion in short-term financing used this year , which caused much of next year 's shortfall .	action now shifts to the senate , which is weighing what to do with the house tax bills and looking for ways to drum up new money .	many of the tax bills face opposition from businesses that would pay more in taxes with the changes .	meanwhile , the package of tax bills does n't meet jindal 's parameters for what tax changes he is willing to consider .	senators are looking for loopholes to jindal 's rules , seeking to cobble together a budget and tax deal considered veto-proof .

"	it does not ban homemade guns .	it simply holds these assembled guns at home to the same standard " as other weapons , de leon said .	his bill would allow the manufacture or assembly of homemade weapons but require the makers to first apply to the state department of justice for a serial number that would be given only after the applicant undergoes a background check .	the number would have to be engraved on or otherwise permanently attached to the weapon within one day of its manufacture .	de leon 's bill goes further than the federal government , which last month renewed for 10 years an existing ban on plastic firearms that can slip past metal detectors and x-ray machines .	he plans to amend the bill to require that the guns contain permanent pieces of metal that could be detected by x-ray machines and metal detectors , a proposal that was blocked in the federal legislation .	sb808 narrowly passed the senate on a 21-9 vote and now heads to the assembly .
when darde long toured the warner park zoo on her first day in aug. 21 , 1985 , she realized she was facing an uphill battle of fulfilling her dream of helping animals .	hank the chimpanzee was surrounded by heavy bars in a cage so cramped he could grab a rung in either hand and rock it from side to side .	down the row , frankie the hyena paced endlessly in a narrow , 15-foot concrete kennel run until his paws bled .	then 28 , long was a part-time veterinary student who had thought of little else but working with animals since age 9 .	she was doggedly optimistic and a self-described " pushy broad " who demanded or scavenged what she needed .	by her second day , she began using her limited resources to improve the then-48-year-old facility . "	it was like operating in the dark ages a little bit , " she said . "	nobody had thought of the zoo in the sense of needing those things . "	if long ever lost sight of what the animals were going through , she only had to look around her office , a cramped cubby with no phone .	it did have air conditioning , though , which meant it served double duty as a recovery room for the animal infirmary next door .	like the animals , she walked on concrete , a fact she sought to remedy by laying down " heinous " pink tiles she scavenged from the parks and recreation department .	in the 27 years since , both long and her charges have seen drastic improvements to their surroundings thanks to a two-decade renaissance she led along with friends of the zoo , a private nonprofit advocacy and fundraising group .	when long first arrived , the zoo was a 1 1/2 - acre park on the edge of closure .	the atlanta journal-constitution described it " chattanooga 's animal ghetto .

public health officials in the u.s. are exasperated by their inability to persuade more parents to vaccinate their children , saying they 're dealing with a small minority who are misinformed ?	or merely obstinate ?	about the risks of inoculations .	those parents contend they have done their own research and they believe the risks are greater than health authorities acknowledge .	they say they are merely making their own medical choices .	that leaves public health officials struggling to find ways to get their message across . "	as scientists , we 're probably the least equipped to know how to do this , " said stephen morse , a columbia university infectious disease expert .	their frustration comes amid unsettling outbreaks of some vaccine-preventable diseases that had nearly disappeared from the united states .	measles is a leading worry .	cases have jumped back into the hundreds over the last five years or so as infected travelers sparked outbreaks in poorly vaccinated communities .	the fear is that if the number of unvaccinated families keeps growing , sustained spread of measles will be re-established in the united states . "	that 's what we do n't want to happen again , " said dr. walter orenstein of emory university , considered one of the leading u.s. experts on vaccines .	most parents do bring their children for shots , and national vaccination rates for kindergarteners remain comfortably above 90 percent .	experts are n't even sure the ranks of families who do n't vaccinate are growing to any significant degree .	but in some states , the number of parents seeking exemptions from school attendance vaccination requirements has been inching up .	in some communities , large proportions of households skip or delay shots . "	part of the reason everyone is so concerned about this is because they do n't know whether things will get worse , " orenstein said .	scientists have long assumed the problem is that some parents are simply misinformed , and providing them " corrective information " will clear things up .	but some studies have shown that does n't seem to work .	for example , in the last 15 years , a leading concern of many vaccine opponents is that shots trigger autism in children .	one recent study found that some vaccine-opposed parents could be presented with medical evidence disproving that , and seemed persuaded .	but they also said they still did not intend to vaccinate their kids . "	people are really good at coming up with reasons to believe what they already believe , " said jason reifler , a political scientist at the university of exeter who co-authored the study .	in fact , vaccines can have side effects ?	very severe ones , in extremely rare cases that doctors ca n't always anticipate . "	it may be one in a million or one in 2 million , but i ca n't tell you that it wo n't happen to your child , " morse said .	some parents say , " i 'm not willing to take that chance with my child , " he added .	parents have been nervous about vaccines for as long as vaccines have been around ?	at times with good reason .	more than 100 years ago , vaccines were unregulated and could be as likely to harm a child as protect them .	opposition seemed to plummet for several decades , as vaccines got better and succeeded in beating back diseases that had long terrified families , including polio , measles and whooping cough .	but parental concern has seemed to be on an upswing in the last 20 years .	family decisions about vaccinations have always involved a cost-benefit analysis , in which parents weigh the danger of the disease against side effects or other potential risks from the vaccine itself .	as overall vaccination rates hit high levels and diseases became rare , some families have decided the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits , observed massachusetts general hospital 's dr. stephen calderwood , president of the infectious diseases society of america .	another strategy is to simply make more parents vaccinate , through a concerted effort to eliminate philosophical exemptions to vaccinations or to make the exemption application process more demanding .	several experts interviewed believed reducing exemptions is the most practical approach , in a country where individual freedoms are sometimes celebrated at the expense of the communal good . "	no other country relies on mandatory vaccinations as significantly as the u.s. does to insure high rates of vaccination , " said jason schwartz , a medical historian who studies vaccine policy at princeton university . "	one argument is we need those mandates . "

by joseph spector albany , n.y. -- new york gov. andrew cuomo on tuesday signed into law a tougher ban on texting while driving that will allow police to pull someone over directly for it and increase the penalties for violators .	in 2009 , new york passed a texting-while-driving ban that was widely panned because it was classified as a secondary offense .	that meant police could only issue a ticket if a driver was pulled over for another offense , such as erratic driving .	but last month the state legislature passed the tougher bill to make it a primary offense if a driver were caught using any portable device .	the law is effective immediately . "	the message today is those electronic devices and driving do not mix .	period , " cuomo said at a bill signing in manhattan .	cuomo also ordered the state department of motor vehicles to increase the penalty from two to three points on a person 's license .	the national highway traffic safety administration reported that 16 percent of fatal accidents in 2009 nationally were the result of distracted driving .	the new law will require distracted driving curriculum for people seeking a license .	the fine will remain at up to $ 150 .	police hailed the new law , saying the old one had hamstrung enforcement .	sheriff 's deputies " do n't want to investigate car crashes , " said ontario county ( n.y. ) sheriff philip povero . "	they 're working to protect people and reduce crashes , and will take the extra time to make the observations to detect when a person is texting .

a bill aimed at advancing a gas line to meet alaska 's energy needs passed the state house despite concerns of a lack of oversight for the project and the price customers ultimately pay for gas .	hb4 passed 30-9 late monday night after hours of debate and failed attempts led by minority democrats to amend the bill , including one to give the regulatory commission of alaska authority to review and approve contracts to ensure " just and reasonable " gas costs .	two members of the minority caucus , reps. max gruenberg of anchorage and scott kawasaki of fairbanks , joined with the majority in voting for the bill .	kawasaki said on the floor that he was n't yet sure how he would vote .	two majority members , reps. eric feige , r-chickaloon , and neal foster , d-nome , joined the rest of the minority ?	reps. les gara , harriet drummond , andy josephson , beth kerttula , jonathan kreiss-tomkins , geran tarr and chris tuck ?	in voting no .	supporters see hb4 as providing the tools needed for the alaska gasline development corp. , or agdc , to get to an open season , the point at which officials could determine if there is sufficient interest for a project to move forward .	they see the project as having momentum , and cast it as a way to take care of alaskans ' needs first , rather than overseas markets .	critics say they understand the desire to get gas to alaskans ?	a stated goal of the bill 's sponsors ?	but see hb4 as too far-reaching , with too-little oversight .	they also say the better project for alaska would be a major liquefied natural gas project capable of overseas exports being pursued by the north slope 's three major players and transcanada corp. . "	we do n't have enough information to make reasonable decisions that , at the end of the day , assures that alaskans get reasonably priced gas .	that 's the bottom line , " kerttula , the house democratic leader , told reporters tuesday . "	we do n't have that information so we 're not doing our due diligence , you know ?	that 's the way i feel about it . "	hb4 is seen as one of the major pieces still in play ?	along with the budgets , an oil tax overhaul and a liquefied natural gas trucking plan ?	as the legislature nears its scheduled adjournment april 14 .	it also is a priority for house speaker mike chenault , who took the unusual step of coming down from his presiding seat monday night to speak to the bill on the floor before its passage .	senate resources was scheduled to start hearing hb4 on tuesday afternoon .	under the bill , agdc , now a subsidiary of the alaska housing finance corp. , would be made an independent public corporation overseen by a board confirmed by the legislature .	its powers would include the ability to determine ownership of a pipeline developed by the corporation ; plan , finance and build a pipeline system ; issue bonds for project financing ; and exercise eminent domain to acquire land deemed necessary for the pipeline .	prior to reaching the floor , the bill was amended to , among other things , try to address concerns about the state 's obligation .	joe dubler , agdc vice president and chief financial officer , had told the house finance committee that the state 's credit rating could suffer if the state failed to recapitalize a proposed reserve fund to help agdc meet its debt obligations .	it 's not clear to what extent , or whether , the fund might be used .	but the latest version of the bill requires legislative authorization of a reserve fund .	it also adds two commissioners to the board of directors , though the commissioners of revenue and natural resources could not serve on the board unless the big line has been abandoned or is no longer receiving inducements .	transcanada currently has an exclusive license to advance a major gas line project , and is receiving up to $ 500 million in reimbursable costs from the state for that effort .	rep. alan austerman , r-kodiak , said on the floor monday night that he wished the three major companies ?	bp , exxon mobil corp. , and conocophillips ?	were ready and able to build the large line .	but he said he does n't see that happening in the near future , and believes the right thing to do is move forward with the in-state line .

the north carolina house and senate spent weeks this summer unable to agree on a state budget .	now their inability to agree on how to adjourn could leave this year 's session in more confusion .	house and senate republicans passed competing versions of adjournment resolutions late last week that differed on which legislation to consider if they were to return next week and in mid-november .	the two sides would like to work out legislation on cleaning up coal ash pits and overhauling medicaid .	but they disagree on when they want to tackle particular issues .	without an adjournment agreement , the chambers technically remain in session , and must hold skeleton meetings every fourth day ?	even if they do n't transact any business ?	to comply with the state constitution .	the first such senate meeting is tuesday .	senate republicans scheduled a late monday conference call in part to consider their next steps .	it was n't clear monday what repercussions could follow if the legislature failed its constitutional obligation to keep meeting every fourth day .	the legislative building was virtually empty monday as lawmakers fled raleigh following several days of high-stakes negotiations , some of which stretched into the wee hours .	gop gov. pat mccrory could spur legislative leaders back to raleigh for an agreement if he vetoes one of the 17 bills lawmakers have left on his desk and lawmakers want to consider overriding the veto .	he has several days to decide .	one bill will certainly be signed : the budget .	mccrory has said he would sign into law the budget adjustment bill that senate and house members finally approved friday and saturday .	the budget 's protracted negotiations had delayed the adjournment once projected by july 4 .	the session began may 14 .	mccrory did n't know when he would sign the budget bill into law as " the governor is reviewing it line by line , " spokesman ryan tronovitch said by email .	the senate passed an adjournment last friday that would punt the coal ash and medicaid issues to nov. 17 .	but house leaders wanted to take up coal ash and other legislation stuck in negotiations much sooner ?	next week .	so the house passed its own adjournment resolution saturday morning that broadened their workload for an aug. 14 return to include bills on economic incentives , regulatory changes and mandating insurance coverage for autism disorders .	the senate refused to consider the house measure later saturday .	without an adjournment agreement , the senate scheduled a so-called " skeleton " session tuesday morning , followed by the house on wednesday .	conceivably , these sessions could go through the rest of the year , when the two-year terms of current general assembly members expire .	similar low-profile floor meetings went on for months in 2002 to leave open an ongoing special session on legislative redistricting .	gerry cohen , who retired last week as the legislature 's special counsel , said monday the state constitution provides for no legal remedy if house or senate members fail to convene every fourth day , but he believes the general assembly would still legally be in session .	he said it was possible a court could compel the legislature to meet if the failure to meet was challenged .	spokeswomen for house speaker thom tillis , r-mecklenburg , did n't respond to a request for comment late monday .	rep. tim moore , r-cleveland , and house rules committee chairman , also did n't return a phone call .	speaking to reporters friday , mccrory acknowledged the long hours that legislators had worked in recent weeks and said he wanted them to " take a long nap and get back home and see their families . "	but he also said he would be in contact with house and senate leaders this week as they try to resolve their differences .	the lack of a formal adjournment resolution also could prevent legislators who are running for re-election in november from receiving campaign contributions from political action committees linked to organizations that have lobbyists at the general assembly .	such donations are unlawful to receive when the legislature meets during its regular sessions .

utah state university rolled out an electric transit bus thursday that 's capable of being recharged wirelessly and signals a revolution for road travel of the future .	wireless power has been used for years in some consumer devices and in factory power strips .	now engineers say they 've perfected it for vehicles with a system tailored for bus transit routes .	the university said the technology is notable mainly for transferring a wireless charge through thin air with little loss in energy .	utah state officials hope the new technology turns into a commercial success .	it 's a " great leap forward in the science and engineering " of electric vehicles , said robert t. behunin , vice president of commercialization at the school . "	as a result of the work done by utah state engineers , scientists and partners , ev owners and operators will now be able to simply drive over a pad in the ground to recharge their batteries , the benefits of which reach far beyond convenience , " behunin said .	the bus gets a wireless boost from charging pads the size of a dinner plate embedded in concrete , with a matching receiver plate on the underbelly of the bus .	electricity jumps the 10-inch air gap with little loss in energy ?	the key to enhanced technology developed by a team led by hunter wu , a university research scientist .	utah state recruited wu from the university of auckland in new zealand , where he earned a doctorate in electrical engineering in 2010 .	his team says the wireless device presents no risk of electrocution for anyone who stumbles across it in a road .	officials say the bus that took passengers for a ride thursday is a prototype of another bus that will be delivered shortly to the university of utah in salt lake city .	the u.s. department of transportation gave wave inc. , a utah state university spin-off company , a $ 2.7 million grant to set up an electrified bus route there .	wave , in partnership with the utah transit authority , will launch its first commercial demonstration in mid-2013 on the university of utah 's campus .	the university of utah will be the first organization in the nation to use a shuttle bus that tops off its battery charge by merely sitting for a few minutes over a magnetic conductor .	with a seamless charging system , transit buses can use radically smaller batteries for a big weight savings .	frequent but brief stops for a wireless boost eliminate the need for overnight plug-in charging , which ca n't power a bus for a full day 's use , said wesley smith , the chief executive of wave inc. . "	this technology makes electric buses competitive with their diesel hybrid and cng counterparts , " smith said .	the pad will be embedded in pavement at the light-rail station at the school , where the bus will idle several minutes before picking up rail passengers for a quick shuttle through the heart of the campus .	because the shuttle bus will travel a short circuit , it can use a small battery that can be recharged frequently .	that translates into an 85 percent weight savings over conventional battery packs for plug-in vehicles , which have to draw on their power for an entire day before recharging becomes practical , smith said .	the secret to the new system is frequent and quick charging , a concept that could be extended to a futuristic highway where all vehicles become electric and draw energy continuously from the pavement without having to stop for a recharge .	however , experts say the investment will require enormous investments in new infrastructure , because highways would have to be ripped up for installation of wireless power strips .

south dakota 's largest private health insurance provider wants to hike rates by almost 43 percent for those who signed up for individual insurance plans under the federal affordable care act .	wellmark blue cross blue shield sent a request to the south dakota division of insurance this month asking it to approve a 42.9 percent rate increase , saying the hike was necessary because of large claims , costly prescriptions and members dropping coverage after expensive procedures .	the state says it likely will approve , adjust or deny the request by july .	about 14,000 south dakota residents have individual insurance plans that are compliant with the aca through the company , which makes up about 4 percent of its total members in the state .	in south dakota and iowa , wellmark has so far decided not to join the federal health care exchange set up by the affordable care act , but still allows members who do not receive insurance through an employer to purchase aca-compliant health care plans through licensed agents , brokers and direct from its website .	that influx of new , previously uninsurable and sicker members who are now required under the law to be covered is likely the main factor driving up costs , according to one national health policy expert .	laura jackson , the executive vice president of wellmark , in a webinar earlier this month , said the company anticipated the new population would have some pent-up demand but said wellmark has been incurring even higher costs than anticipated from its members with individual aca-compliant policies who are using services at a higher rate . "	this is merely an unsustainable proposition for wellmark when we 're actually taking in less dollars than we 're paying out , " she said .	only sanford health plan , avera health plans and dakotacare offer subsidized plans on the federal exchange used in south dakota .	officials at sanford and avera said they 've proposed increases in the " low teens " for 2016 .	bob laszewski , the president of health policy and strategy associates in virginia , said wellmark 's proposed rate increase is likely a reflection of the " guaranteed issue " provision of the aca , which says a company can not refuse to insure someone because of a preexisting medical condition .	he said healthy people are likely not enrolling in unsubsidized aca-compliant plans , which are more expensive . "	so these are disproportionately sick people who could n't get health insurance before , now they can ... and south dakota is just getting hit hard with big medical claims , " he said .	with the proposed rate increases , some south dakota residents may want to explore other options , including plans on the federal marketplace , said kim jones , the statewide coordinator for the south dakota community action partnership navigators , which helps people understand the health insurance exchange " that 's why when open ( enrollment ) comes around again , if you 're a person who has a private plan , it would be worth your while to investigate plans on the health insurance marketplace , " jones said .	jeff sandene , the chief integration officer for sanford , said they regularly look at the issues cited by wellmark but said they have n't contributed to a spike in rates and members will find next year 's increase " reasonable and predictable . " "	it 's been more of a reasonable increase , more likely because we just have n't seen spikes in those areas that they referenced , " he said .	wellmark has more individuals with off-exchange aca-compliant plans than sanford and avera .	at avera , chief administrative officer deb muller said in a statement that the company expects average rate increase for individuals to be in the low teens .	muller said the company has n't seen individuals buying plans to get costly care and then dropping them .
on the second level of a parking garage at houston methodist hospital , behind an inconspicuous door , sits a workshop of aging machines that have helped make significant contributions in the field of cardiovascular medicine .	and at the heart of this workshop is a modest man , the hospital machinist , juan fernandez .	he spends his days in the former storage facility measuring , drilling and carving out tools that help mend failing hearts , heal broken limbs and foster scientific discoveries .	while fernandez has no medical expertise or formal education in engineering , he has worked in the texas medical center for more than 25 years , building tools for physicians and researchers , turning their visions into realities .	working with various materials from plastics to metals , fernandez has created everything from microscope slide holders and surgical instruments to prototypes for cardiovascular devices .	in the 1990s , he helped world-renowned heart surgeon dr. michael debakey create a prototype for the left ventricular assist device , known as the lvad , a blood flow pump that has saved the lives of countless heart patients awaiting transplants . "	he 's helped advance science and medicine in the texas medical center , " stephen igo , director of the entrepreneurial institute for the houston methodist debakey heart & vascular center , told the houston chronicle ( http://bit.ly/k9hffh ) . "	there 's no doubt about it . "	fernandez , 65 , began his career in the medical center in 1985 at the baylor college of medicine , where he ran the machine shop .	however , in october 2010 , due to budget cuts , baylor closed the machine shop , leaving fernandez without a job .	igo , who has worked with fernandez for about 20 years , jumped on the opportunity to bring him to methodist , which purchased all of his old machines from baylor and provided the new shop for him in 2011 . "	he 's absolutely a resource , " igo said . "	people will show up with drawings on napkins , envelopes or a piece of paper and he 'll turn into a finished product . "	born in mexico , fernandez and his family moved to houston when he was 7 .	his first brush with machines came in high school when he took a vocational welding class .	after graduating in 1968 , one of his older brothers , a tool grinder , got him work with a company that made parts and tools for oil rigs .	soon he was learning to use lathes and mills , making valves and drill bits for rigs .	he spent a short time with the u.s. marine corps reserve , returning home by 1971 to work at the machining company .	he also wed his junior high sweetheart .	the couple , now 43 years strong , share two daughters and a son .	after more than 15 years making parts for oil rigs , his company relocated , leaving him searching for other jobs .	he ran across a newspaper job listing from baylor for a machinist . "	why would baylor need a machinist ? "	he remembered thinking .	three months later , he started the job .	while he has built tools for various physicians from pediatricians to plastic surgeons , fernandez said his most important work has been done in the cardiovascular field .	in 1991 , fernandez began working with debakey and his team on the left ventricular assist device .	designed to assist with the function of a failing heart , the lvad , now owned by micromed , was part of a number of heart assist devices that made an impact in the cardiovascular field , creating both a bridge to transplantation for patients as well permanent implants .	for six years , fernandez said he worked on the model , designed by debakey and nasa engineers .	there were 15 to 16 models of the lvad before the final version was ready to be manufactured .	he still has the first prototype . "	they were going to throw it away and i said ' i 'll keep it , ' " he said .	the project was especially important to him .	only a few years after immigrating to the united states , fernandez 's father suddenly died at 52 from heart failure .	often while he worked on the lvad , fernandez thought about the huge advancements made in cardiovascular medicine that might have saved his father 's life . "	i guess you could say i was doing it for him too , " fernandez said . "	he 's gone , but hopefully it could save someone else 's father . "	most recently , fernandez has spent much of his time at methodist working on building components for a heartbeat simulator used in the hospital 's cardiovascular hemodynamics imaging lab .	the simulator is a model of the cardiovascular system , designed to allow physicians and researchers to study the blood flow through heart valves .	they are able to use the simulator to test the accuracy of clinical imaging techniques such as ultrasounds and mris .	fernandez not only built the mock heart chamber , but most of the parts that help the simulator operate .	dr. stephen little , cardiologist and director of houston methodist debakey heart & vascular center 's valve clinic , said the first version of the mock chamber began with a peanut butter jar .	methodist researchers have used the device to conduct and publish studies on blood flow in the heart that can help physicians make better clinical decisions , little said .	he stressed that to have someone with fernandez 's expertise and craftsmanship is invaluable . "	i 'm a 70 to 80 percent full-time clinician and i do n't have the ability to make this stuff , " he said . "	these kinds of projects would never happen if we did n't access to someone who could simply say ' yeah , no problem , i 'll take a chunk of plastic and make into a heart for you . ' "	some days are busy and others are slow at the machine shop .	on a mid-december day , fernandez carefully worked on his milling machine , creating a plastic wedge slide for a researcher studying sensory pathways in the brain .	the wedge would be used so researchers could cut brain slices at precise angles .	fernandez said he does n't always ask much about how every tool or instrument he creates will be used in the future . "	i just make sure it 's made right , " he said .	no matter how big or small the job , fernandez said he always makes sure the finished product is of the highest quality and precisely what the physician asked for . "	it makes me feel like i contributed in some way to mankind , " he said . "	not in a huge way , but i had some part in it . "

a university of cincinnati police officer who shot a motorist during a traffic stop over a missing front license plate has been indicted on murder charges and a prosecutor said wednesday that the officer " purposely killed him . "	prosecutor joe deters announced the grand jury indictment at a news conference to discuss developments in the investigation into the july 19 shooting of 43-year-old motorist samuel dubose by officer ray tensing .	dubose 's death comes amid months of national scrutiny of police dealings with african-americans , especially those killed by officers .	dubose was black .	tensing is white .	authorities have n't indicated whether race was a part of the investigation .	authorities have said tensing spotted a car driven by dubose and missing the front license plate , which is required by ohio law .	they say tensing stopped the car and a struggle ensued after dubose refused to provide a driver 's license and get out of the car .	tensing has said he was dragged by the car and forced to shoot at dubose .	he fired one shot , striking dubose in the head .	but deters dismissed tensing 's claim that he was dragged by the car and suggested that he should n't have pulled dubose over to begin with . "	he fell backward after he shot ( dubose ) in the head , " deters said .	the university of cincinnati said it fired tensing after his indictment .	tensing turned himself in wednesday afternoon at the hamilton county justice center and was processed on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter .	tensing 's attorney , stewart mathews , did n't return phone messages seeking comment after the indictment announcement .	mathews said earlier wednesday that he thought an indictment was likely " given the political climate " and comments made by city officials .	but mathews said given the evidence he 's seen , he does n't believe there should be an indictment .	body-camera video of the shooting was also released wednesday .	dubose 's family had been pressing for its release , and news organizations including the associated press had sued deters to get it released under ohio open records law , but deters released it before any ruling had been made .	deters called the shooting " senseless " and " asinine . " "	he purposely killed him , " deters said . "	he should never have been a police officer . "	the prosecutor also said he thought it was time to reconsider the uc police department 's role . "	i do n't think a university should be in the policing business , " deters said .	a message for comment was left wednesday with the police department .	the university said earlier this week it plans an independent review of its police department 's policies .	the university of cincinnati on wednesday closed its main campus in anticipation of grand jury action in the case .	if convicted , tensing could face up to life in prison .
the moon has come a long way since galileo first peered at it through a telescope .	unmanned probes have circled around it and landed on its surface .	twelve american astronauts have walked on it .	and lunar rocks and soil have been hauled back from it .	despite being well studied , earth 's closest neighbor remains an enigma .	over the new year 's weekend , a pair of spacecraft the size of washing machines are set to enter orbit around it in the latest lunar mission .	their job is to measure the uneven gravity field and determine what lies beneath ?	straight down to the core .	since rocketing from the florida coast in september , the near-identical grail spacecraft have been independently traveling to their destination and will arrive 24 hours apart .	their paths are right on target that engineers recently decided not to tweak their positions . "	both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch , but one can never take anything for granted in this business , " said mission chief scientist maria zuber of the massachusetts institute of technology .	the nail-biting part is yet to come .	on new year 's eve , one of the grail probes ?	short for gravity recovery and interior laboratory ?	will fire its engine to slow down so that it could be captured into orbit .	this move will be repeated by the other the following day .	engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise .	getting struck by a cosmic ray may prevent the completion of the engine burn and they wo n't get boosted into the right orbit . "	i know i 'm going to be nervous .	i 'm definitely a worrywart , " said project manager david lehman of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory , which manages the $ 496 million , three-month mission .	once in orbit , the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles ( 200 kilometers ) .	data collection wo n't begin until march .	previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success .	grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal .	as the probes circle the moon , regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down .	this in turn will change the distance between them .	radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps , allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field .	using the gravity information , scientists can deduce what 's below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces earth .	the probes are officially known as grail-a and grail-b .	several months ago , nasa hosted a contest inviting schools and students to submit new names .	the probes will be christened with the winning names after the second orbit insertion , zuber said .	besides the one instrument on board , each spacecraft also carries a camera for educational purposes .	run by a company founded by sally ride , the first american woman in space , middle school students from participating schools can choose their own lunar targets to image during the mission .	a trip to the moon is typically relatively quick .	it took apollo astronauts three days to get there .	since grail was launched from a relatively small rocket to save on costs , the journey took 3 1/2 months .	scientists expect the mission to yield a bounty of new information about the moon , but do n't count on the u.s. sending astronauts back anytime soon .	the constellation program was canceled last year by president barack obama , who favors landing on an asteroid as a stepping stone to mars .

a federal judge on tuesday ordered the u.s. fish and wildlife service to rewrite parts of its plan to protect a tiny , threatened fish that lives in california 's freshwater delta .	u.s. district judge oliver wanger said in a 225-page opinion that portions of the guidelines meant to protect the delta smelt and manage water flows from the sacramento-san joaquin delta violated the law .	the opinion covered six cases filed separately by agriculture interests , environmental groups and urban water districts against federal wildlife , land and water managers over plans meant to safeguard the dwindling species , called a biological opinion . "	the 2008 ( biological opinion findings ) are arbitrary , capricious , and unlawful , and are remanded to fish & wildlife for further consideration in accordance with this decision and the requirements of law , " wanger wrote .	he also blamed fish & wildlife for conducting " sloppy science and uni-directional prescriptions that ignore california 's water needs . "	wanger 's opinion does not dispute that the massive pumps used to deliver water to farms in the san joaquin valley and southern california cities have harmed the silvery smelt , which is listed as threatened under the endangered species act .	but he said parts of the 2008 plan needed to be redone to better determine the pumping restrictions ' economic effects on farmers and other businesses reliant on water deliveries . "	with the economy struggling and unemployment still soaring , it is welcome to see a judge refusing to rubber stamp extreme , destructive and unjustified environmental regulations , " said damien schiff , an attorney with the pacific legal foundation , which represented three farmers who say water cutbacks harmed their businesses .	the ruling itself is not expected to have an immediate effect on water deliveries .	attorneys said details of any changes would be decided in future court hearings .	in recent years , court decisions aimed at protecting the smelt have restricted water deliveries from the delta , the inland estuary where the finger-sized fish live , and have spelled major losses for growers in the state 's farm belt who rely on the system to irrigate their crops .	the delta is also the heart of california 's water delivery system , and provides drinking water for 25 million people .	urban water districts in southern california welcomed tuesday 's ruling , saying the regulatory restrictions previously had " crippled " their water supplies .	the delta smelt is considered a bellwether species for the estuary 's overall health and is listed as an endangered species in california .	environmental groups who are fighting for the smelt 's protections were buoyed that wanger 's opinion made clear that the pumping was killing the fish , but said it would ultimately lead to more delays while federal scientists conduct more tests and revise their plan . "	while we go back and forth trying to find more perfect information , the estuary keeps declining , " said kate poole , an attorney with the natural resources defense council . "	and the best result for the environment and the state 's water supply is to restore that estuary , so to the extent that this delays that from happening , it 's disappointing . "

rain fell wednesday on a red-hot river of lava creeping closer to homes and a main road in a rural big island town .	the precipitation was n't enough to stem the flow , but it did help tamp down smoke pouring from the crackling molten stream consuming everything in its path , officials said .	the lava was about 280 yards ( 255 meters ) from pahoa village road , which leads through the community of pahoa 's downtown , hawaii county civil defense officials said wednesday .	it had advanced about 90 yards ( 82 meters ) since the previous evening .	pahoa is the commercial center of the island 's sprawling , mostly agricultural puna district , south of hilo .	the flow from kilauea volcano entered private property there tuesday and destroyed an empty shed .	it also burned tires and other materials , prompting authorities to warn downwind residents with respiratory problems to stay indoors .	the lava flow emerged from a vent in june and until recently had been slowly weaving through uninhabited forest and pastureland .	officials say dozens of homes , businesses and other structures are now in its projected path .	most residents there either already have left or are prepared to go .	jeff and denise lagrimas packed up to leave for a town 14 miles ( 22 kilometers ) away .	the flow is expected to slither past properties across the street from their home as it works its way to the ocean .	they decided not to stay and see if that happens or if the lava burns their home .

a developer who mistakenly built a $ 1.8 million waterfront house on parkland has been ordered to remove it .	the rhode island supreme court found that the narragansett home was built entirely on land owned by the rose nulman park foundation , and therefore must be removed .	the developer , four twenty corp. , began building the home in 2009 , but it did n't discover the error until 2011 when it tried to sell the house and the prospective buyers got a survey .	robert lamoureux , who owns the company , then contacted one of the park 's trustees to try to work something out , but she told him the land was not for sale , according to friday 's opinion .	the foundation was set up to preserve the property as a park in perpetuity .	a 2008 agreement among the family members says that if the trustees allow the land to be used as anything other than a public park , they must pay $ 1.5 million to new york presbyterian hospital .	the developer argued it should not be penalized for an innocent surveying mistake .	the court said it was sympathetic , but it said the park 's property rights outweighed that .	it also said it was in the public 's interest to keep the land as a park . "	any attempt to build on even a portion of the property would constitute an irreparable injury , not only to plaintiff but to the public , " it wrote .	an email to the developer 's lawyer was not immediately returned .	a judge will decide how much time the developer has to remove the house .	a lawyer for the foundation , mark freel , says the developer has secured most of the permits he needs to move it to the neighboring land , but that the fate of one critical permit is still up in the air .	the timing of that could affect whether the house has to be torn down . "	my client has wanted for a long time for the house to be removed , " he said . "	my client 's very clear and firm position is that it 's time for the house to go . "
myanmar 's health ministry has ordered the eviction of 82 hiv/aids patients from a shelter run by supporters of democracy leader aung san suu kyi because the center is not hygienic , state media said wednesday .	an official at the facility said the patients have refused to move , setting the stage for a showdown with authorities who said they must vacate by thursday .	local authorities last week ordered the hiv/aids victims to leave following a visit by the newly freed suu kyi , who promised to help provide badly needed medicine .	health officials inspected the shelter in july and august and found it unhygienic with patients susceptible to infections because of overcrowding , the state-run myanma ahlin newspaper said .	but shelter organizers said authorities simply want to pressure them because of the visit by suu kyi , who was freed from more than seven years of house arrest nov. 13 .	yarzar , one of the center 's staff members who uses only one name , admitted the shelter was crowded but said preventive measures were taken against the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis .	health authorities offered to relocate patients to a state-run hiv/aids center , but they refused to move out as their shelter not only offers medical care , food and accommodation but " warmth and affection that no other center can provide , " yarzar said .	since the patients have decided not to leave , yarzar said he was ready to face any consequences .	the shelter , which includes a small wooden house and a two-story building of wood and thatch walls , accommodates 82 patients , including young children .	suu kyi , who won the 1991 nobel peace prize for her nonviolent struggle for democracy , was first arrested in 1989 .	she has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years .	suu kyi led her party , the national league for democracy , to victory in 1990 elections , but the junta refused to recognize the results .
for five years , st. petersburg police officer richard linkiewicz has embodied the city 's efforts to help the homeless .	when the tent city at pinellas hope has openings , he brings in newcomers .	if someone sleeping beneath the interstate want to move to a drying-out shelter , he finds an available bed .	if somebody 's mother in detroit offers the old room back , linkiewicz can provide bus fare .	he is " officer rich " to st. petersburg 's downtrodden , armed with a cell phone that rings every five minutes and a take-charge attitude that values solutions over small talk .	after hours , linkiewicz , 46 , has played a lesser-known role .	for two years , he rented out bedrooms in adjacent meadowlawn homes to people with small incomes and nowhere to go . "	for what i pay , it 's a great place .	my goodness , i can sleep at night , " renter mark ducharme , 51 , said recently .	because linkiewicz , himself , lives in one of the two houses , " everyone feels safe here , " ducharme said . "	i lucked out . "	police officials were less comfortable recently , when they learned the details .	linkiewicz had not violated any policy , said police chief chuck harmon , " but if there is a perception he is making money off the backs people he working with , then that would be a problem . "	and so , linkiewicz and the people he has personally sheltered are having to part ways .	richard linkiewicz was 8 when his family moved to florida from massachusetts .	he went to northeast high , st. petersburg college and the university of south florida before joining the police force 22 years ago .	his current job as st. petersburg 's only " homeless outreach officer " was created five years ago after police roused downtown squatters , slashed their tents and received withering national criticism as a city without a heart .	linkiewicz teams with social worker ryne laxton from operation par , doling out pamphlets , cards with their phone number and a standing offer to help whenever people decide to get off the street . "	he listens to everybody , " laxton said . "	the way homeless people treat him with friendly respect is amazing .	when i came , i got that same friendly respect just because i was in his car .	that took years to build that reputation . "	linkiewicz 's role as landlord began about two years ago .	a divorce had left him with the marital home in a modest part of meadowlawn , a recently purchased rental unit next door and considerable debt .	the housing market 's plummet did n't help .	linkiewicz began renting bedrooms to people wanting to move from pinellas hope into more permanent , enclosed housing with heat and air conditioning .	many were disabled people or veterans with small monthly checks , or people who could qualify for $ 450 monthly housing vouchers from the county or city , so $ 450 became the rent .	at that price , options are limited , said sheila lopez , chief executive of catholic charities and founding director of pinellas hope .	unlike linkiewicz , most landlords require first and last month 's rent in advance .	renters also usually pay utilities . "	when you find someone who will give proper housing ?	anybody , the cat , the dog or the pool man ?	you jump at it , " lopez said . "	as long as it is decent , safe and sanitary . "	ducharme once rented a room in tampa for $ 125 a week ?	three to a room .	with linkiewicz , he got his own room , half-bath , cable tv and a shelf in the community refrigerator .	andy powell , 65 , said he tried other places but public housing apartments rejected him because he had a prison record . "	to find a place as nice as this one , i could n't afford it . "	linkiewicz said the houses ?	with seven bedrooms between them ?	often stayed full , including him in one bedroom and his adult son , who works and goes to school , in another .	because renters came from pinellas hope , he had a pretty good idea who would get along and who would n't . "	there are just a few rules , " he said . "	no falling down drunk .	no throwing up on the front lawn .	like you would be at your mother 's house .	do n't be a fool . "	only one renter bombed out ?	dancing outside drunk in his underwear on his third day , linkiewicz said . "	i gave him his money back and took him to a hotel . "	rent payments do not quite cover his mortgages , utilities , taxes and insurance , he said .	but opening his houses , plus working plenty of overtime , has helped him dig out of debt . "	i told my son , ' i 've got my health .	i 've got a great job .	once i get out of this jumble , i 'll buy a house just for us .	but this is how it is for us right now .	we have a roof over our heads , power , water and food . ' "	when the st. petersburg times asked to review linkiewicz 's personnel file for this story , the police chief learned about linkiewicz 's renters and gave him a choice : take a different job within the department or stop renting rooms to people from pinellas hope . "	at the end of the day , he should not be renting to people he is coming into contact with as result of his job , " harmon said . "	i do n't want the department , or him , to be in a position where people could view that as a conflict of interest . "	linkiewicz also had to find new accommodations for current renters , harmon said .	as it turned out , pinellas hope was opening an 80-unit apartment complex that week , adjacent to the tents .	they also rent for $ 450 a month . "	i 'm going to give them sheila 's phone number .	they all know sheila , " linkiewicz said , referring to pinellas hope 's director sheila lopez . "	nobody is going to go from my house to the street . "

pennsylvania 's former health secretary says the state has failed to seriously study the potential health impacts of one of the nation 's biggest natural gas drilling booms .	dr. eli avila also says the state 's current strategy is a disservice to people and even to the industry itself because health officials need to be proactive in protecting the public . "	the lack of any action speaks volumes , " said avila , who is now the public health commissioner for orange county , new york . "	do n't bs the public .	their health comes first . "	avila told the associated press that he believes senior political advisers did a " disservice " to republican gov. tom corbett by putting a study of health effects on the back burner three years ago .	that has led to a cycle of public fear and confusion , avila said . "	what are you so afraid that we 're going to uncover ? "	avila said of industry leaders , adding that it would be better to clearly tell people what is or is n't a problem . "	it 's not that i 'm against fracking .	i 'm sure it 's helping many individuals financially . "	the gas drilling industry has said hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , is safe and there 's no evidence of serious health problems from it .	in 2011 , an advisory commission recommended the state create a public health registry to track drilling-related complaints and address concerns .	the state house approved $ 2 million for it , but senate gop leaders and the governor 's office cut the funding at the last minute .	the marcellus shale drilling boom that began in pennsylvania around 2008 has generated tens of thousands of direct jobs and more than a billion dollars in royalties to landowners but also complaints about air and water pollution and the industrialization of nearby communities .	some people have complained that nearby drilling led to headaches , nosebleeds and other problems , and there are long-term concerns about the toxic chemicals used in the fracking process that breaks the rock to free gas .	but without coordinated statewide research , it 's impossible to know how widespread or dangerous the problems are or even if drilling is responsible .	avila spoke after media outlet state impact reported that two former health department employees said they had been told to forward certain environmental health complaints ?	including drilling ?	to the bureau of epidemiology and to not discuss the issues with callers .	the memo included other subjects beyond drilling , such as superfund sites , garbage dumps and mining .	health department spokeswoman aimee tysarczyk said in an email , " there was not and is not an effort to keep employees from taking marcellus shale-related health complaints or from following up on complaints . "	all such complaints , she said , are " immediately reported to the bureau of epidemiology for review and follow-up . "	tysarczyk said the department has responded to all 51 marcellus shale health-related complaints it has received , and " any complaint or investigation is shared directly with the individual involved and his or her physician if the individual has seen a physician . "	the database of the complaints contains personal health information and ca n't be made public because of medical privacy laws .	state impact reports that pennsylvania , colorado and north dakota log drilling-related complaints in databases , but health departments in ohio , oklahoma , texas , wyoming and west virginia do n't keep track of them at all .	avila said he thinks corbett is a " good man " who 's being hurt politically by top advisers who do n't let the governor hear directly from qualified health experts .	avila resigned from the post in 2012 after serving two years .	the ap asked corbett on friday if he supported creating a health registry for drilling complaints .	corbett said he does n't know where the department of health stands on the issue now . "	i 'd have to know what they 've been talking about before i can answer that , " he said .	another public health expert said the bigger point is n't how the phone calls to the health department were handled ; rather , the issue should be the ongoing lack of a rigorous program to study and respond to drilling-related health complaints .	pennsylvania is " simply not doing " serious studies into possible health impacts of drilling , said dr. bernard goldstein , who has five decades of public health experience at hospitals and universities in new york , new jersey , and pennsylvania .	goldstein said questions about drilling and public health are not going away , and he suggested that pennsylvania " do what their advisory commission told them to do , " since it 's not too late to start a health registry for drilling complaints .	avila noted that " fracking 's not going anywhere .	so what you really need to do is assure the public that you 're going to protect them . "	that has n't happened , he said . "	how can you keep the public safe if you 're not collecting data " on drilling-related complaints , he asked .

alaska emergency crews will attempt friday to recover the remains of eight cruise ship passengers and a pilot who were killed when their sightseeing plane crashed in a remote and rugged area of southeastern alaska .	wind and rain prevented any recovery after the wreckage of the aircraft was found thursday against a granite rock face , 800 feet above a lake .	there was no immediate indication of why the dehavilland dhc-3 otter turboprop went down , killing the nine people during the sightseeing excursion .	no names have been released .	clint johnson , head of the national transportation safety board 's alaska office , said it was too soon to know circumstances of the crash , including whether the plane flew into the cliff .	the ntsb was assembling a high-level team to investigate the crash , including three members from alaska and at least two people from washington , d.c. " the initial rescue crew that went in had a very tough time because of the terrain , " johnson said . "	it 's a very steep , mountainous area , and weather conditions caused them to stand down . "	he earlier confirmed the deaths : " '' we have nine fatalities . "	coast guard petty officer lauren steenson said the agency received a report around 2:15 p.m. that the plane was overdue .	troopers said an emergency locator transmitter activated in the misty fjords national monument , and a helicopter pilot spotted the downed aircraft above ella lake , about 800 miles southeast of anchorage .	promech air , an airline based in ketchikan , operated the shore excursion sold through holland america line , the cruise ship company said in a statement .	the eight passengers were guests on the westerdam , which is on a seven-day cruise that departed seattle on saturday .

a handwritten letter from fascist italian dictator benito mussolini congratulating president franklin d. roosevelt on his inauguration , and a note from a woman who had a brief affair with roosevelt were shown to the public for the first time wednesday at the national archives .	the 5,000 documents and gifts collected by roosevelt 's secretaries include a note from lucy mercer rutherfurd , who had an affair with roosevelt that forever changed his marriage to eleanor roosevelt when she discovered the infidelity in 1918 .	rutherfurd wrote roosevelt 's personal secretary , grace tully , a week before his death in 1945 to arrange a visit with a portrait painter and photographer .	the " unfinished portrait " was in progress when he collapsed and died .	the meetings with rutherfurd were kept secret from eleanor roosevelt until after her husband 's death , and the letter is evidence tully was involved in communications between rutherfurd and roosevelt .	the 14 boxes of items had been sealed with duct tape for years , and were considered the last great privately-held collection of papers for roosevelt 's presidential library in hyde park , n.y. anne roosevelt , the president 's granddaughter , said tully and another personal secretary , marguerite " missy " lehand , were devoted to roosevelt . "	their understanding of what to save and what to collect was important , " she said . "	we are grateful to them for being pack rats . "	it took an act of congress to get the documents to the national archives , though , after an ownership dispute .	the sun-times media group inc. , formerly hollinger international inc. , bought the collection in 2001 for $ 8 million .	in 2004 , hollinger put the items up for sale at christie 's auction house , but the national archives claimed ownership to some of the times , saying they were presidential materials .	the company eventually agreed to donate the items in exchange for a tax credit .	a 2009 bankruptcy filing by the sun-times media group could have scuttled the whole deal , said roosevelt library director cynthia koch .	the multimillion dollar collection could have been divided up and sold off .	new york sen. charles schumer and rep. louise slaughter sponsored bills to smooth the way for the donation with a full tax deduction .	schumer said it will ensure the papers are preserved . "	it has a magical feeling to hold a paper that roosevelt himself had and to put yourself in his place as he made decisions about some of the most vexing problems our country ever faced , " he said .	the donation became official june 30 after president barack obama signed the bill into law .	in the past month , archivist robert clark has sorted and organized about a third of the collection . "	for the first time , you see the inner workings of fdr 's inner office and how missy and grace interacted with the president ?	but also how they interacted with all those people around roosevelt , " clark said .	a month after world war ii broke out in europe , u.s. ambassador joseph kennedy wrote a personal note from london to lehand .	he described his view of the war , along with some personal reflections . "	it is lonesome as the devil here without the family and at the same time the delivery of mail is very bad , and chances are from now on it is going to be worse , " kennedy wrote .	the roosevelt library plans to make the papers available to the public for research by nov. 15 and will post them all online in january .	clark said it 's too soon to know whether the collection will change any roosevelt history .	much is still unknown about roosevelt , so the collection will prove valuable , said u.s. archivist david ferriero . "	they help fill gaps in the record of a presidency that changed america , " he said . "	roosevelt did not keep a diary , did not sit for extensive interviews with historians , did not live to write his memoirs , and he never completely confided in anyone , not even his wife . "
the men were charged in the 2010 killing of brian terry during the sting operation known as fast and furious , in which federal agents allowed criminals to buy guns with the intention of tracking them .	instead , agents from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives lost track of 1,400 of the 2,000 guns involved in the operation , including two weapons found at the scene of terry 's killing .	opening statements began wednesday in the trial of jesus leonel sanchez-meza , also known as lionel portillo-meza , and ivan soto-barraza .	they are the first suspects in terry 's death to face trial .	two others have already pleaded guilty , and another two remain fugitives .	the judge has excluded any information about the failed operation during the case .	sanchez-meza and soto-barraza were members of a " rip-off " crew that planned on robbing marijuana smugglers in the arizona desert when they encountered agents patrolling the area on dec. 14 , 2010 .	a gunfight between the crew and the agents ensued .	authorities later discovered that two of the guns found at the scene had been part of fast and furious .	the operation allowed criminals to buy guns in phoenix-area shops with the intention of tracking them once they made their way into mexico .	it became a major distraction for the obama administration as republicans in congress conducted a series of inquiries into how the justice department allowed such an operation to happen .	former attorney general eric holder was held in contempt after he refused to divulge documents for a congressional investigation into the matter .	since then , the justice department has focused on arresting and trying all suspects involved .	manuel osorio-arellanes , one of the men present but likely not the shooter , has been sentenced in the killing .	he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in february 2014 to 30 years in prison .	rosario rafael burboa-alvarez , accused of assembling the armed crew that was supposed to steal marijuana from smugglers when they encountered terry and other agents , struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors last month that will likely result in a 30-year prison sentence , with credit for time served .	he will be sentenced in october .	two other suspects are still on the loose .	sanchez-meza and soto-barraza face charges of first-degree and second-degree murder , assault on a federal officer , conspiracy to commit robbery , attempted interference with commerce by robbery and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence .
the u.s. town shattered by last week 's school shooting held its first two funerals monday , including the one for the youngest victim , and officials were n't sure whether the school itself would ever reopen .	nervous students and teachers across the country returned to classrooms under tighter security .	further details on just what happened during friday 's shooting were " too difficult to discuss , " state police lt. paul vance , standing in a cold rain , told reporters .	the first funerals were for 6-year-old jack pinto and noah pozner , who had his birthday two weeks ago .	noah 's twin sister , arielle , who was assigned to a different classroom , survived .	in front of the funeral home where relatives were mourning noah , well-wishers placed two teddy bears , a bouquet of white flowers and a single red rose at the base of a maple tree .	hymns rang out from inside the funeral home where jack 's service was being held .	the boys were being buried a day after the small community of newtown , already stripping itself of many christmas decorations , came together for a vigil where president barack obama said he will use " whatever power " he has to prevent similar massacres . "	what choice do we have ? "	he said . "	are we really prepared to say that we 're powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard ? "	obama has given no specifics on what he might do , and white house spokesman jay carney on monday warned that " no single piece of legislation or action will fully address the problem . "	investigators have offered no motive for the shooting , and the connecticut community struggled to comprehend what drove 20-year-old adam lanza to shoot to death his mother at home in bed friday morning , drive her car to the school and unleash gunfire on six adults and 20 children who were 6 and 7 years old .	all the victims at the school apparently were shot more than once , and some of them were shot at close range , chief medical examiner dr. h. wayne carver has said .	he said the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim 's body and inflict the maximum amount of damage . "	i can tell you it broke our hearts when we could n't save them all , " vance said .	he said two adults who were injured were recovering .	vance also said police may hold the school and the lanza home for months as the investigation continues .	police said lanza was carrying an arsenal of ammunition big enough to kill just about every student in the school if given enough time .	he shot himself in the head just as he heard police drawing near , authorities said .	newtown officials could n't say whether sandy hook elementary would ever reopen .	monday 's classes were canceled , and the district was making plans to send surviving students to a former school building in a neighboring town . "	we 're just now getting ready to talk to our son about who was killed , " said robert licata , the father of a student who escaped harm during the shooting . "	he 's not even there yet . "	newtown police lt. george sinko said he " would find it very difficult " for students to return to the same school .	but , he added , " we want to keep these kids together .	they need to support each other . "	on sunday , a grim obama told connecticut gov. dannel malloy that friday was the most difficult day of his presidency .	at the newtown vigil , the president finished his speech by slowly reading the first names of the children killed .	cries and sobs filled the room . "	that 's when it really hit home , " said jose sabillon , who attended the interfaith memorial with his son , nick , who survived the shooting unharmed . "	god has called them all home , " obama said . "	for those of us who remain , let us find the strength to carry on and make our country worthy of their memory . "	on monday , the task swung again to understanding how the shooting could have happened .	investigators have offered no motive , and police have found no letters or diaries that could explain .	they believe lanza attended sandy hook many years ago , but they could n't say why he went there friday .	authorities said lanza had no criminal history , and it was not clear whether he had a job .	a spokesman for western connecticut state university said lanza took college classes when he was only 16 .	paul steinmetz confirmed that lanza dropped out of a german language class and withdrew from a computer science class but earned high grades in a computer class , american history and macroeconomics .	a former classmate there , dot stasny , said she and a classmate once invited lanza out to a bar but he declined , saying he was only 17 . "	we attributed him being quiet to him being so much younger than the rest of us , " said stasny , 30 . "	i assumed he was this super smart kid who was just doing extra course work . "	stasny said she once laughed with him about how difficult the german class was . "	i just remember him as a nice , quiet kid , " she said .	divorce paperwork made public monday shows that lanza 's mother had the authority to make all decisions regarding his upbringing .	it makes no mention of any mental health issues regarding lanza .	the paperwork says the marriage broke down " irretrievably . "	the divorce was finalized in september 2009 , when adam lanza was 17 .	federal agents have concluded that lanza visited an area shooting range , but they do not know whether he practiced shooting there .	lanza is believed to have used a bushmaster ar-15 rifle in the school attack , a civilian version of the military 's m-16 .	versions of the ar-15 were outlawed in the united states under the 1994 assault weapons ban .	that law expired in 2004 , and congress , in a nod to the political power of the gun-rights lobby , did not renew it .	gun rights activists have remained largely quiet .	in an interview on " fox news sunday , " rep. louie gohmert , a texas republican , defended the sale of assault weapons and said that the principal at sandy hook , who authorities say died trying to overtake the shooter , should herself have been armed .	at both funeral homes monday , people wrestled with the same questions as the rest of the country ?	what steps could and should be taken to prevent anything like the massacre from happening again . "	if people want to go hunting , a single-shot rifle does the job , and that does the job to protect your home , too .	if you need more than that , i do n't know what to say , " ray distephan said outside noah 's funeral .	he added : " i do n't want to see my kids go to schools that become maximum-security fortresses .	that 's not the world i want to live in , and that 's not the world i want to raise them in . "

"	people just call you up , saying , ' tell us what you need and we 'll be there . '	we do n't do it because it 's expected of us , we just do it , " he said .	volunteering is part of the farming life , said brad koenig , of sloan , iowa . "	you know that you 've got neighbors who will help you out if you get in a pinch .	it 's just an assumed deal that 's been around in the farming community for years , " he said .	carol byers said she was continually surprised by the outpouring of support . "	i just feel very humble , and i hope they know how thankful i am that i live here , " she said .

in a small granite plaza a block from the new york stock exchange , a group of 20-somethings in flannel pajama pants and tie-dyed t-shirts are plotting the demise of wall street as we know it .	they have been there since saturday , sleeping on cardboard boxes , eating pizza and take-out dinners that were paid for by donations to their cause .	there are only about 200 of them left now , though they started out 1,500 strong .	welcome to the headquarters of " occupy wall street , " a place where topless women stood wednesday morning on the corner shouting " i ca n't afford a shirt ! "	while construction workers eagerly snapped photos on their phones .	a small group of the protesters wound their way through the streets of lower manhattan escorted by police officers , blaring bullhorns and chanting " resist !	stand up !	there comes a time when the people rise up ! "	what , exactly , they are protesting is somewhat unclear .	when asked what they are fighting , they gave a variety of responses ranging from wall street to global warming .	on its website , the group proclaims : " we , the people of the united states of america , considering the crisis at hand , now reassert our sovereign control of our land . "	sam wood , an unemployed 21-year-old , said he was there because he does n't think it 's fair " the way that the rich get more breaks than the poor . " "	what i really want to achieve is to educate people about what 's going on with the economy right now , " he said as he bumped into another protester waving an american flag . "	a couple of the ways that we might be able to fix it , you know ? "	a barricade was set up to protect the nyse building as they marched past it .	some people in suits stopped in the street to gaze curiously at the scene in the plaza ?	a strange jumble of people carrying signs , playing snare drums and openly smoking marijuana on benches .	police watched the proceedings carefully after a scuffle tuesday that led to seven arrests and one injured protester .	most of those arrested were given disorderly conduct summonses and released .	four more protesters were arrested wednesday for disorderly conduct and released .	ryan reed , 21 , a senior at rutgers university , was missing class to attend the protest , but his professors are letting him make up the work by writing papers about the experience . "	the enemy is the big business leaders of wall street , the big oil company leaders , the coal company leaders , the big military industrial leaders , " he said . "	i came out here because what i see ?	and what i feel most people in this country see ?	is an economy and a system that 's collapsing . "	kaitlyn leigh , 21 , said she is going to move out of her apartment and stay here indefinitely because she 's been so inspired by what she 's seen . "	it 's about creating a community in this liberated space , " she said . "	it 's about having the ability to have people 's needs met , whether it be food , clothing , shelter . "	every afternoon , the group convenes at the center of the plaza for what they call a " general assembly , " a meeting during which they map out their tactics for the next day .	forbidden from using a microphone ?	they do n't have the proper permits ?	the group got creative . "	what we do is a people 's microphone , " reed said . "	so the person who 's speaking says a couple of words and then the whole crowd repeats it so everyone can hear .	it 's actually beautiful . "	for reed , at least , an ideal outcome for the situation would be a near-shutdown of wall street , with protesters descending upon wall street and preventing bankers from getting to their desks .	but he realizes that may not happen anytime soon ?	particularly not before he returns to class next week . "	so far we have n't had the numbers to clog the kind of traffic we need to clog , " he admitted .	though the crowd has thinned as the days pass , the group is vowing to stick it out as long as possible .	bill csapo , an unofficial spokesman for the protesters , said they 've gained access to a commercial kitchen and plan to start cooking meals for the group in the next day or two .	on saturday night , people donated $ 10,000 worth of pizzas .	csapo , of cleveland , tennessee , has n't actually traveled to manhattan for the event .	he got involved by meeting some of the organizers on internet forums , which is how the whole thing got started .	but he said the occupiers ?	a term he prefers instead of " protesters " ?	are n't leaving anytime soon . "	i 'm currently unemployed and loving what i 'm doing , " leigh said . "	i 'm going to stay here until the end . "

"	since 1886 , st. john has been a place for east side worshippers to gather , pray and celebrate .	the red brick church 977 e. fifth st. has been the host of many of their most important memories , from joyous baptisms , first communions and weddings to somber funerals .	the congregation will merge with st. pascal baylon catholic church at 1757 conway st. at the end of june , and welzbacher plans to retire .	st. john 's building will be put up for sale or lease .	although parishioners opposed the merger , it was inevitable , said the 85-year-old welzbacher . "	the number of priests active ... is limited , " said welzbacher , who has served at st. john for seven years . "	some of the big parishes have thousands of families and need that manpower . "	st. john once had 1,400 members .	it now has 152 families , or about 400 members , welzbacher said .	st. pascal has more than 1,000 parishioners .	by merging , the workload among the priests can be more evenly divided , he said .	members of st. john came to understand the reasoning , welzbacher said , and added that he does n't detect any anger .	parishioner patricia swanson says she 's going to miss the personal touch a small church like st. john offers .	anyone can call the priest and talk , she said . "	it 's really sad to kill a community of faithful believers , " she said .	some of rita mealey 's favorite memories are rooted in st. john .	the dayton 's bluff resident taught at its former school for 20 years and took her family to masses there .	she recalled her eldest daughter 's first communion years ago . "	ann was wearing a beautiful white dress , " mealey said , remembering the trip to a local restaurant for breakfast and then the mass. " betty wanted a white dress , too . "	both girls were fighting over who would wear it , " mealey said with a chuckle .	long-time parishioner jack peterfeso remembers the church 's fish dinners .	people would stay up all night preparing the meals , he said .	he said he will miss the traditions and father welzbacher 's sermons . "	the little things he says really get at your heart .	he 's not afraid to speak out , " peterfeso said .	peterfeso , who lives in rosemount , said he likely will not go to the newer st. pascal .	he is thinking of worshipping at the more traditional church of st. agnes at 548 lafond ave. in st. paul .	the rev. michael byron at st. pascal looks forward to welcoming new parishioners .	he said he knows that some , like peterfeso , may choose to go elsewhere .	sacred heart catholic church at 840 e. sixth st. is little more than two blocks from st. john .	while sacred heart is a franciscan parish , st. john and st. pascal were meant to serve a geographical area , so it makes sense for them to merge , byron said .	byron went to st. john a few weeks ago to celebrate mass and meet parishioners .	the church was an important piece of the east side 's history , he noted . "	it 's a loss of a tradition and a loss of a presence that will be deeply felt , " he said .	the east side of st. paul was n't the urban neighborhood it is now back when the right rev. john ireland , bishop of st. paul , noted a need for an english-speaking catholic church in dayton 's bluff .	the area was sparsely populated by newcomers to the region , according to church historians .	ireland asked the rev. louis cornelis , a pastor at mendota , to take on the project .	cornelis noted the community was mostly poor and struggling to build homes , but he was willing to tackle the request .	cornelis quickly canvassed the neighborhood for money and collected more than $ 1,100 .	the church was finished within months and dedicated on dec. 19 , 1886 .	the parish , then known as st. john irish , was st. paul 's 12th catholic church .	according to st. john historians , father cornelis had worked so hard building the parish that he fell sick and was forced to retire several months later .	the growing parish needed more space , and the current brick church replaced the original structure in 1922 .	the $ 125,000 church celebrated its first mass on easter sunday a year later .	the church will celebrate its last mass on june 30 .	an " elaborate closing " is planned , welzbacher said , and added that he expects many of the old-timers will attend to visit the church they grew up in .	welzbacher himself will then retire , though he will still volunteer on weekends at the church of the holy family in st. louis park .	this is an ap member exchange shared by the pioneer press .
a brazilian police official says six men have been killed in near-simultaneous attacks in a sao paulo following the murder of a police officer .	an official with sao paulo 's civil police force said the bullet-riddled body of officer leonilson figueiredo dias was found dead on wednesday near his house in the neighborhood of parelheiros .	several hours later , three attacks in the same neighborhood targeted a street vendor , his son and four other men .	a seventh man was also shot but survived .	witnesses said the gunmen in all three attacks fired out of a moving vehicle .	the official said thursday that police are investigating whether there is any connection between the officer 's murder and the other killings .	she declined to be identified because she 's not authorized to speak to the press .
proposed cuts to pension payouts and health care would save detroit about $ 120 million annually over four years and help leave the city with a budget surplus of $ 89 million , according to mayor dave bing 's deficit elimination plan .	the plan was given individually wednesday to the nine detroit city council members and follows bing 's $ 3.1 billion proposed budget which he presented to them last month .	his deficit elimination plan calls for almost $ 90 million in cuts each year beginning with the 2012-13 fiscal year budget through 2015-16 to the two city pensions , nearly $ 19 million annually in health care cuts to current employees and about $ 14.1 million in similar cuts to city retirees .	bing has warned that republican gov. rick snyder could appoint a financial manager over detroit if the city 's finances are n't fixed . "	this deficit elimination plan represents a strategic approach to fiscal stability and the need to address pension and health care costs , " bing said in a statement . "	it is an unprecedented forecast of our revenues and expenses over the next five years , and what must be done to ensure detroit 's survival . "	detroit 's budget deficit stands at $ 155 million .	bing has proposed $ 200 million in cuts for the 2011-12 fiscal year which starts july 1 , but said the deficit could swell unless there are more cuts , and payments to city pensions and health care expenses are reduced .	bing met earlier this week with city union leadership .	he said the meeting was to lay out detroit 's financial situation before seeking concessions .	some city unions have battled bing on past concession requests , like wage cuts .	bigger battles could follow over the deficit elimination plan , said john riehl , president of afscme local 207 and a member of the city 's general pension board . "	there is no incentive to agree to these types of drastic changes , " riehl said wednesday . "	also , current workers and retirees do n't deserve these kinds of hits .	the health care cuts the unions would resist ... to the max . "	bing 's plan shows the city with a projected accumulated deficit of $ 203.7 million next fiscal year .	the deficit is reduced over each of the next two years and rises to a surplus of $ 7.3 million in 2015 , then $ 89.5 million the following fiscal year .	those figures only stand if there is no other spending by the city , bing spokesman dan lijana said . "	we 're sure money would be needed for capital investments , " he added .	council members have to vote on the plan , which then would go to snyder and the state treasurer 's office . "	we have had discussions with the governor on the plan and will be continuing those discussions , " lijana said .

a suspected gang member accused of participating in what 's being called the city 's worst case of anti-gay violence in recent memory is not a monster and should be given a chance to tell his side of the story , his lawyer said thursday .	the 10 men appeared one by one before a judge in the bronx as prosecutors said they were ready to present evidence to indict them on various charges including assault , sexual abuse and harassment , all as hate crimes .	authorities say the oct. 3 attacks at a bronx home were touched off because gang members thought one of their recruits was gay .	a 17-year-old was beaten and sodomized with a plunger handle , police say .	another 17-year-old also thought to be gay was attacked , and a 30-year-old and his brother were beaten as well .	their laywers said they are innocent .

"	our goal is to make it look and feel like it was , " van loben sels said . "	it 's so unique , we want it to stay the same . "	concerts and weddings will be moved to a lawn above a small vineyard on a nearby west-facing slope .	temporary tents will provide cover from the weather .	the winery 's tasting room , in a separate building , remains open on the scenic grounds at 4705 n. fruithill road , which overlooks spokane valley .	van loben sels said he , his family and the staff have received an outpouring of concern from customers and the public since the fire .

the end of summer is fast approaching , and the surrounding lakes are seeing an associated slowdown in visitation after an active tourist season , but officials say plenty of pleasant days are still ahead .	the dog days of summer follow a season of unusually cool temperatures and plenty of rain that brought a steady stream of recreation to the area , officials say . "	we 've had an entirely different weather pattern this year than we 're used to , but it 's made for some great turnouts , " said greg butts , arkansas state parks director . "	the water did rise over the memorial day weekend , which kept us from selling fuel at the marina for a little while , " butts said , referring to degray lake to the south of hot springs .	and it was during the storms following memorial day that a few mishaps affected business .	but nothing was out of the ordinary . "	we had a lightning strike that caused a power outage to half of the park at lake degray , but things like that happen fairly often , " he said . "	since then the weather has been great , we 've had a lot of visitors and we could n't have asked for a more perfect four days for the fourth of july holiday . "	degray is now gearing up for labor day weekend . "	even though it 's slowing down now , labor day always marks the last hurrah for all recreational boating enthusiasts , " butts said .	as more people make their way out on local waterways , officials say it is important that boaters stay water wise . "	for the most part , the debris we had early on this summer from our storms in may is cleared out , but it 's important for everyone on the lake to be aware of their surroundings , " said brian westfall , natural resource specialist for the u.s. army corps of engineers ' lake ouachita project management office .	westfall said rangers are continuing to promote the " let it go " campaign , which encourages swimmers to not pursue boats and objects that float away from them as they are swimming . "	the problem is we overestimate our swimming abilities and we underestimate the distance an object is away from us , " he said .	and rangers stress having a trip plan before hitting the water . "	never go out on the water without letting someone know where you 're going to be and when you 're planning on coming back , " he said . "	that way , the minute they realize you 're probably not coming back we know exactly where to start looking . "	westfall , as he spoke with the sentinel-record ( http://bit.ly/17mqkb9 ) , said that from his office window lake ouachita looked perfect for any last-minute outings . "	the levels are great and the water is extremely clear .	there are still some pleasant days left out on the lake , " he said . "	we want people to remember that this is their lake to enjoy whenever they 'd like .	but we do ask that people leave no trace of their visit , " he said .	after the summer season closes in a few weeks , there will be several volunteer cleanup events . "	we ask people to come to our shoreline cleanups and show pride in our community and our lakes , because our lakes have such an economic impact on hot springs , " he said .	the success of other tourist destinations this summer took a bit of a toll on the local industry , according to one lake ouachita business .	bill barnes , owner of mountain harbor resort , said lodging reservations have been coming in last minute this year , which is not typical . "	we 've had a good year , but there 's still a lodging softness largely in part because of bp 's marketing of the gulf coast , " barnes said .	because the gulf 's target market is the same as the arkansas tourism market , deals offered by gulf coast hotels and attractions this year have pulled vacationers down south . "	i know 19 families personally that are either at the gulf or on their way there for vacation , " he said . "	it 's a phenomenon we 've never really seen before , but as prices go back up our visitors will start coming back and everything will balance back out . "	as for lake volume , like butts and westfall , barnes said there has been a steady stream of visitors . "	this summer weather has been magnificent , and the lushness of the forests has been beautiful , " he said . "	ever since schools started going back in mid-august , labor day weekend is n't quite the event it used to be .	but , we will have a great turnout just like our best days of the summer . "	and with the start of the fall season , a new crowd of people with different interests will flock to the lakes . "	we 've already seen a good number of bookings for group packages and empty-nesters for this fall , which is great , " barnes said .	the changing colors of the leaves and fall hunting and fishing bring many visitors out .	westfall said one of the more exciting activities in the fall is bird watching . "	around october , we 'll start seeing an increase of bald eagles , swans and pelicans , " he said . "	the colors of the leaves and seeing these birds out on the lake is quite beautiful that time of year , and we 're looking forward to it . "
ennis lake 's water level is dropping after a boulder the size of a school bus crushed a 30-foot wide section of the madison dam .	officials say the boulder fell from a cliff early monday onto three spill gates , though the damage appears to be relatively minor .	ppl montana says water has been slowly draining from the lake since , but the boulder is actually blocking even more water from flowing through the damaged spill gates .	ppl montana engineers have begun releasing more water to ease pressure on the boulder and to allow engineers to gauge the damage .	ppl montana says the lake 's level is expected to drop by about 5 feet by late wednesday .	the lake may eventually be drawn down 9 feet , which would allow a full inspection .	the lake is outside of ennis , which is about 50 miles southwest of bozeman .
the shipwrecked costa concordia was successfully refloated monday in preparation to be towed away for scrapping , 30 months after it struck a reef and capsized , killing 32 people .	authorities expressed satisfaction that the operation to float the concordia from an underwater platform had proceeded without a hitch .	technicians were preparing to shift it some 30 meters ( yards ) and then anchor the massive cruise ship before ending the day 's operations .	the entire operation to remove the concordia from the reef and float it to genova , where it will be scrapped , will cost a total of 1.5 billion euros ( $ 2 billion ) , costa crociere spa ceo michael tamm told reporters .	the heavily listing ship was dragged upright in a daring maneuver last september , and then crews fastened huge tanks to its flanks to float it .	towing is set to begin july 21 .	it 's about 200 nautical miles ( 320 kilometers ) to genova and the trip is expected to take five days .

state senator steve russell said thursday he wo n't run for a second term in 2012 and that he plans instead to focus on his speaking engagements and other business interests .	the oklahoma city republican kept open the possibility that he might seek another political office . "	i 'm not going to completely rule out any political service in the future , but right now my business interests are my passion , " russell , 48 , a retired lieutenant colonel in the u.s. army , told the associated press . "	i 've got 30 productive years of my life ahead of me , and i just do n't know if i want to be a politician for the rest of that . "	a self-described constitutional conservative , russell is a vocal advocate for expanding the rights of gun owners and military personnel .	he said his greatest accomplishment was a law that exempts military pay from state income taxes , but he acknowledged that he occasionally became frustrated with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle . "	as i look back on three years , i honestly thought that if i could take a stand , i could rally others to protect and defend the constitution at all hazards , " russell said . "	i still think that 's possible , but i do n't think it 's readily achievable . "	i think that the self-interests of human beings are a great force to be reckoned with when defending the constitution ... regardless of party , " he said .	russell , whose battalion was heavily involved in the search for and capture of saddam hussein during the iraq war in 2003 , said he 's also excited about the success of his book titled " we got him ! "	that was initially distributed locally but has since been purchased by a major publisher and is scheduled to be released nationally in december .	russell also travels across the country as a motivational speaker and started a rifle company , two rivers arms , which produces semi-automatic versions of the tabuk weapons used by enemy soldiers in iraq . "	i 'm really enjoying my business interests and those pursuits right now , " he said .	russell plans to complete his term , which expires next year .	senate district 45 covers much of southwest oklahoma city .

at nasa 's kennedy space center , more than 900 people will turn in their identification badges on oct. 1 , a month before discovery is set for launch on its grand finale .	an additional 3,000 people , at least , will be out of work in april unless nasa gets the money for an additional flight beyond the two final missions remaining on its schedule .	and as it stands , an extra shuttle mission would only provide a reprieve until late july or august .	reality is setting in across the nation 's shuttle homeport , raising concerns that people might jump ship early if other job opportunities open up .	the potential loss of critically skilled civil service and contractor personnel , consequently , remains high on nasa 's list of top risks - just as high as the chance that a solid rocket booster or main engine might catastrophically fail in flight , according to the latest risk review , obtained by florida today through the freedom of information act . "	we 've been most concerned about maintaining and sustaining the knowledge necessary to safely conduct mission operations , " said retired navy vice adm. joseph dyer , who leads the aerospace safety advisory panel , created by congress to oversee nasa programs .	nonetheless , nasa , the main shuttle contractor , united space alliance , and independent safety experts do n't expect an 11th-hour exodus of workers that might jeopardize the ability to safely launch and land the last missions .	the results of work force surveys , also obtained through the freedom of information act , reflect a fierce loyalty and a dedication to sticking it out .	people want to be there when the last shuttle touches down and the wheels stop .	they want to make history . "	they love being part of nasa and what nasa does , and they love being part of the space shuttle program .	and they want to be a part of it as long as we 're doing the kinds of things that we 're doing , " added leroy cain , nasa 's deputy shuttle program manager . "	it 's not more complicated than that . "	nasa 's shuttle safety and mission assurance office tracks top program risks to keep senior managers attuned to safety issues .	the managers , in turn , use the reviews to make certain the proper amount of attention and funding are being put toward mitigating the risks .	among the chief technical risks in the latest review , presented to program managers this summer : - catastrophic strikes by space debris ; - aging propellant pressurization tanks that might explode ; - foam or ice breaking free from the shuttle 's external tank and doing critical damage to heat-shield components . "	those are the ever-present reminders that space flight has been , is and will continue to be dangerous business , " dyer said . "	it is experimental flight test .	those risks are recognized and we think they are being managed .	but they are also very , very real . "	the potential loss of critically skilled workers was recognized as a risk soon after the bush administration in january 2004 directed nasa to complete the international space station and retire the shuttle fleet by 2010 .	it was deemed one of the biggest management challenges nasa and its contractors would face leading up to shuttle retirement . "	we realized back then that we had a risk in front of us - that once people started to recognize ( fleet retirement ) , they were going to look for other jobs , " said mark nappi , vice president of launch and recovery systems and florida site executive for united space alliance .	so the shuttle fleet operator put in place severance packages as incentives for workers to stay on the job . "	critical completion bonuses " also have been doled out to make sure the company maintains the right skill mix through the last shuttle landing .	nasa 's last two currently scheduled missions are set for launches on nov. 1 and feb. 26 . "	really , it 's some money at the end of the rainbow , " nappi said . "	when the shuttle is done flying , if these people get laid off , we can guarantee a certain amount of money to bridge them to their next job or bridge them to retirement . "	nasa 's shuttle program in 2006 employed 14,000 contractors and 1,800 civil servants in eight states and washington , d.c. by november 2009 , the work force had been cut to 10,300 contractors and 1,200 civil servants .	the contractor work force at the end of may : 8,741 . "	we recognize ( the potential loss of critical skills ) as a risk .	but we feel good about how it 's being managed and how the work force is supporting the program , " dyer said .	the risk , however , probably will rise as nasa continues to approach fleet retirement . "	certainly , it 's something that bears continuous leadership attention as we come to the close of the program , " dyer said .

minnesota attorney general lori swanson has advised the legislature to forge ahead with a bill making clear that lawmakers ca n't avoid arrest for drunken driving or other crimes during a legislative session , but a key senator said thursday he still thinks the measure is unnecessary .	swanson 's nonbinding opinion issued tuesday in a letter addresses a hot-button bill that would explicitly revoke " privilege from arrest " for criminal activity while lawmakers are in session .	it 's a clause in the constitution meant to keep lawmakers for being detained for all but treason , felony crimes or breach of the peace .	how far the privilege extends is a point of controversy .	some lawmakers are pushing legislation to remove any doubt that criminal acts make lawmakers subject to arrest .	a bill doing that has overwhelmingly passed the house .	it has n't progressed in the senate . "	under the circumstances , i believe that it would be helpful and beneficial for the minnesota legislature to give additional direction to legislative members , the public , law enforcement and the courts by enacting legislation to clarify that state legislators have no immunity from arrest for criminal activity , including the crime of driving while intoxicated , " swanson 's letter concludes .	senate judiciary committee chairman ron latz , dfl-st .	louis park , said he is not convinced that a new law is required to resolve what he sees as a misunderstanding of current law .	he said the constitution does n't give legislators a pass when they break the law .	legislators are issued wallet-sized cards highlighting their privilege , and latz said he would prefer to do away with the cards and engage in a robust education effort rather than pass a new law . "	most importantly , we need to make it clear to all new and veteran state legislators that they have absolutely no immunity from arrest for drunk driving , " latz said in a written statement .

most new york residents believe an understanding of the u.s. constitution is vital to the proper functioning of government .	but most say they know little about its specific provisions , such as the roles of the three branches of government , a new survey found .	the poll was being released thursday by new york university 's brennan center for justice as part of its report card on new york civic literacy .	its findings , the authors said , should push lawmakers to " raise the alarm " over the lack of civic engagement in new york and nationally . "	the emphasis on testing , the emphasis on math and science education , has pushed civics , and social science out of schools ' curriculum , " said eric lane , a brennan center fellow who co-authored the study .	lane said the lack of understanding of the government 's constitutional underpinnings has led to " growing factionalism and more dominance by ideological voices who see the world as ' my way or the highway . ' "	the survey of 1,000 registered new york voters was conducted from june 21-july 8 , 2010 and had a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points .	the poll found 76 percent of respondents said they believe in the importance of the constitution and 86 percent say understanding of the document is " vital " for democracy to work properly .	but most acknowledged their own knowledge of the constitution came up short , with just 16 percent saying they are " very familiar " with the document .	nearly a third of respondents said ?	incorrectly ?	that the founders who drafted the constitution were seeking to create a christian nation .	nearly 30 percent said they did n't know the president is in charge of the executive branch .	about 40 percent did not know that the legislative branch makes law .	and just 55 percent said the supreme court has the power to declare a federal law unconstitutional .	respondents were n't much better on knowing their elected officials .	fifty-eight percent of respondents could not name the state 's two senators , democrats chuck schumer and kirsten gillibrand .	but 70 percent correctly identified california democratic rep. nancy pelosi as the house speaker when given a list of names to choose from .	pelosi was speaker at the time the survey was taken ; she was replaced by republican ohio rep. john boehner in january after republican regained control of the u.s. house .	the report calls for civic education in new york schools to be improved and for gov. andrew cuomo to create a state commission to build a strategic planned to improve residents ' understanding of civics .
a report released wednesday gives montana flunking grades for its policies in preparing quality teachers and removing ineffective ones from the classroom .	the national council on teacher quality gave montana an overall grade of f in its state teacher policy yearbook 2011 , the same grade as its last report two years ago .	montana is the only state to receive flunking grades in consecutive reports .	officials at the state office of public instruction say the criteria the group uses in its analysis is flawed , with the proof being that montana 's schools produce high-performing students . "	we are not steering our ship in their direction because we have no evidence that steering our ship in their direction will produce results , " said deputy superintendent dennis parman .	the report flunked the state for its policies in placing well-prepared teachers in classrooms , expanding its teacher pool , identifying effective teachers and removing ineffective ones .	the only area in which the state received a d was in retaining effective teachers , with the group crediting the state with giving individual districts full authority over how teachers are paid .	otherwise , the report consisted of a lengthy list of what the group found to be policy weaknesses , including six areas that hinder montana 's ability to retain good teachers .	in the category of delivering well-prepared teachers , the report listed 11 weaknesses .	they included not requiring teacher candidates to pass an academic proficiency test , not adequately preparing elementary teachers to teach the common core standards that have been adopted by most states and shortcomings in other teacher preparation programs .	the report cited five weaknesses in montana 's policies to expand the pool of teachers , including insufficiently selective or flexible admission criteria for teacher candidates .	there also is no overall policy regarding teacher evaluations , which is one of five deficiencies the report cited how the state identifies effective teachers .	ineffective classroom performance is not grounds for dismissal , which is one of three policy weaknesses cited as making it difficult to remove bad teachers from the classroom .	parman said evidence that the state employs quality teachers is shown through the students .	the national assessment of educational progress figures released late last year showed that montana fourth graders and eight graders beat the national average in reading and math .	superintendent denise juneau said at the time that the scores reflected montana schools ' high quality of teaching .	parman said the state is not resting on its laurels when it comes to teacher quality , but the policies the group recommends do n't all work for montana .	for example , the report does not account for how much local control montana gives individual school districts , suggesting instead that the policies should be centralized , he said . "	i challenge the ntsq to find a state that hits the mark with their criteria and has the same results as we do , " parman said .

the fbi says it 's easy to complain about leaks , but hard to find the leakers .	u.s. intelligence agencies have made 183 complaints about unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the past five years , but the fbi has identified just 14 suspected leakers , none of whom has been prosecuted , according to data assembled by the justice department .	despite getting 183 complaints , the fbi opened just 26 leak investigations , often because referrals from intelligence agencies lacked sufficient information to proceed , fbi director robert mueller told senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy , d-vt .	the starting point for a leak investigation is identifying everyone with authorized access to the information , and the most typical information gap is a failure to identify them all .	even when investigators find a suspect , the leaker often can not be identified beyond a reasonable doubt , as is required for a successful prosecution . "	because indictments in media leak cases are so difficult to obtain , administrative action may be more suitable and may provide a better deterrent to leaks of classified information , " the fbi director said in april in response to questions from senate judiciary committee member sheldon whitehouse , d-r.i. whitehouse had asked the questions following a senate hearing last september .	steven aftergood , head of the project on government secrecy , first reported on the leak probe data on monday .	the justice department 's national security division oversees the work on all leak probes and the fbi has substantial discretion .	even without a referral from another agency , the fbi can open an investigation whenever it becomes aware of a significant leak .	administrative punishment is possible because the fbi is authorized to share the information from its investigations with the agency of the suspected leaker .	the numbers supplied to the senate panel covered 2005 through 2009 ?	a period that came after the opening of the investigation into who in the bush administration disclosed the cia identity of valerie plame , the wife of iraq war critic joe wilson .	in 2007 , a jury convicted i. lewis " scooter " libby , vice president dick cheney 's former chief of staff , of perjury , obstruction and lying to the fbi about libby 's conversations with reporters regarding plame .	president george w. bush commuted libby 's 30-month prison term .	the time span covered by mueller 's answers to capitol hill ended before the current prosecution of former national security agency official thomas drake for allegedly being the source for news articles about the agency , including some that contained classified information .	drake has pleaded not guilty .	mueller 's responses to the senate outlined some of the problems in tracking down leakers .	classified information often can be properly disseminated to a large number of people in government , making identification of the leaker very unlikely , the justice department said .	also , justice department policy requires that leak investigations focus on potential leakers rather than reporters , the recipients of leaks .	balancing first amendment freedoms with national security interests necessarily limits a prosecutor 's access to the reporter who received classified information , the justice department told whitehouse and the judiciary committee .	the plame probe saw a number of reporters called to the witness stand at libby 's trial .	former new york times reporter judith miller spent 85 days in jail rather than testify to a federal grand jury in the probe .	she subsequently did so , and testified as well in open court at libby 's criminal trial .

the obama administration urged china to press north korea to halt provocative actions against south korea , after an artillery attack on the south that the u.s. called a " premeditated " violation of the truce that ended the korean war .	as the isolated north 's only ally and main economic partner , china plays a " pivotal " role in reducing tensions and has a duty to tell pyongyang that deliberate acts " specifically intended to inflame tensions in the region " are not acceptable , the state department said . "	china is pivotal in moving north korea in a fundamentally different direction , " state department spokesman p.j. crowley told reporters . "	we expect china to be clear , like we are , as to where the responsibility for the current situation , the current tension lies .	this is something that we feel strongly about . "	he said u.s. diplomats had delivered that message to chinese officials in washington and beijing in the aftermath of tuesday 's north korean artillery attack on a south korean island that killed two south korean troops and two civilians and aggravated tensions between the rival koreas .	secretary of state hillary rodham clinton is expected to discuss the attack and the response to it by telephone with china 's foreign minister , crowley said .	admiral mike mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , echoed the point of china 's importance in the process in an interview to be aired sunday on cnn 's " fareed zakaria gps . " "	we really think it 's important for the international community to lead , but in particular china , " mullen said . "	it 's a very dangerous area when he ( north korean leader kim jong-il ) does this , it destabilizes the region , and china has as much to lose as anybody in that region with the continuation of this kind of behavior and what the potential might be . "	the u.s. has frequently called on china to press north korea to stop its belligerent actions toward south korea and japan , with limited success .	china has backed u.n. resolutions punishing north korea for nuclear tests but issued only a muted response to the march sinking of a south korean warship that an international investigation blamed on the north .	north korea has denied the allegation .	china said wednesday that it was " highly concerned " about the artillery exchange and urged restraint .	china " feels pain and regret about an incident causing deaths and property losses and is worried about the developments , " foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said in a statement . "	we have always maintained that the relevant parties should , through dialogue and consultation , resolve disputes by peaceful means . "	some american officials and independent analysts have questioned the amount of influence that china actually has with its neighbor and warned against relying on the chinese to change north korean actions .	but on wednesday , the administration was firm that china has to do what it can to reduce tensions even as it acknowledged that beijing may not be able to " dictate " to pyongyang . "	this is a clear case where north korea has to be given a consistent , unified message " that " these provocations are unwarranted , unhelpful and should cease , " crowley said . "	that was our message yesterday to china . "	the administration 's top envoy for north korea policy , stephen bosworth , met with chinese officials in beijing earlier wednesday .	bosworth , who is now en route back to the united states , had been hurriedly dispatched to south korea , japan and china last weekend after revelations that north korea had constructed a new light water nuclear reactor .	those revelations coupled with the latest incident have alarmed the u.s. and its allies , notably japan and south korea with which the u.s. has mutual defense treaties .	tens of thousands of american troops are based in the two countries .	shortly after the barrage , the white house announced it would go ahead with joint military exercises later this week in the yellow sea , just 70 miles south of yeonpyeong island , which was hit by the north korean artillery barrage .	it said the uss george washington aircraft carrier would head to korean waters to take part .	on wednesday , pentagon spokesman col. dave lapan said the planning and the dates of the military exercises had been set prior to the north korea attack .	but , he said china and japan were not notified of the exercises until after the artillery assault .	the exercises are aimed as a deterrent to north korea , he said , but are not a reaction to the latest shelling .	according to the military , the ships involved in the exercise include the uss george washington carrier strike group , which is already under way toward international waters off korea .

the directors of the waterford community fair have invested a lot of time and money into fixing up their fairgrounds off route 19 south of the borough .	but the brilliant blue paint job they gave to their buildings , and all of the other improvements that have been tackled in recent years , will have to last awhile longer .	two straight years of cuts to the pool of money that pennsylvania sets aside to reimburse the state 's 115 fairs for operating expenses and other costs have eaten away at the funds fair officials counted on for fairgrounds improvements , waterford community fair president mike jenkins said .	the $ 29,000 the fair had received in reimbursements when the pennsylvania fair fund contained $ 3.6 million in fiscal year 2008-09 dropped to $ 19,227 when the fair fund was cut to $ 2 million in fiscal year 2009-10 .	with the fair fund now set at $ 1 million for 2010-11 , after gov. ed rendell had initially proposed wiping out the funding entirely , the waterford community fair stands to take another significant financial hit when the reimbursements are doled out later this year . "	it hurts .	but we 're going to keep having the fair , " said jenkins , whose six-day fair opens sept. 6 . "	we have n't raised gate fees in 10 or 15 years .	we 'll keep them the same as long as we can . "	the funding cuts have been equally painful across the region .	the crawford county and the wattsburg-erie county fairs lost more than 60 percent of their respective state reimbursements between fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10 , according to state department of agriculture figures .	the smaller cochranton and north east fairs lost more than a third of their reimbursements during that same period .	but while state reimbursements make up a small portion of the operating cost of large fairs like the crawford county fair , it 's the smaller fairs ?	which rely more heavily on the reimbursements ?	that are suffering , said bob huston , secretary of the albion area fair and a pennsylvania state association of county fairs board member . "	i think it 's sad that we 're putting that pressure on the fairs , because we 're all volunteers , " said huston , whose fair attracted about 35,000 visitors in 2009 . "	we do everything we can to operate economically , as every other fair does .	but with the loss of ( more state reimbursement money ) for fairs like albion , we will have to pull in the purse strings wherever we can . "	reimbursement cuts led to the cancellation of two of the state 's fairs in 2009 .	no one expects additional fairs to shut down this year , but many are making notable changes after the funding cuts , huston said . "	i was visiting the mckean county fair ( recently ) , and they have done some things like cutting out their fireworks show , " he said . "	we 're watching costs and getting sponsorships as much as we can .	every fair needs the money , but it depends on whether you can make adjustments . "	coordinators of the cochranton community fair kept things as they traditionally have been during its six-day run earlier this month .	that included charging no admission . "	at this point we 're really not sure " how the cuts will affect the fair , said fair secretary johanna schneider . "	but it will be more difficult for us , being as we 're a free fair . "	the wattsburg-erie county fair trimmed its premiums a bit in 2009 , and coordinators have started charging concessionaires $ 7 for a weekly pass .	they also have rented out the fairgrounds on route 8 north of wattsburg for more " summer activities , " including a bluegrass festival and a gun raffle , fair president junior hartner said . "	we 've got most every weekend booked up through october .	that 's where we 're going to have to make our money , i guess , " he said .	spartansburg community fair organizers decided in 2009 to raise their vendor 's fee to help offset the reimbursement cut .	it 's too soon to tell which effect the higher fee might have on this year 's roster of vendors , as the contracts are still coming in , fair secretary roger stranahan said .	but he noted that the fair has always maintained a waiting list for vendors . "	the grounds are still pretty well kept by volunteers , and we 've been trying to do regular maintenance on the buildings , " stranahan said . "	we 're not predicting any reimbursement from the state , so you just have to do things yourself . "	the anticipated loss of state reimbursement this year has north east community fair organizers anticipating they will have to raise $ 7,500 to $ 8,000 on their own to keep things operating .	it wo n't affect this year 's fair , which is being funded through savings , fundraisers and sponsorships . "	i should say we 're cautiously optimistic about next year , " fair president rodney blystone said . "	if we can ride out one more year , we might see some changes with the ( state ) government . "	until then , local fair operators said they will continue doing everything they can to keep their fairs running in the way their communities enjoy them . "	what 's really saving us is our community support , " waterford community fair 's jenkins said . "	we have a quality fair , and a lot of people support us . "

the fight over smoking restrictions in washington state is moving from bars and office-buildings to private residences .	the news tribune reports that a group called people united for smoke-free housing is asking the tacoma-pierce county health board to classify secondhand smoke as a " nuisance " in multi-unit housing , because smoke can seep from one apartment to another and bother other residents .	that could allow landlords to evict people for smoking .	the group is pushing to have a similar provision inserted into the state 's landlord-tenant law .	opponents say the measure is unnecessary because landlords can already declare their buildings smoke-free .

the likely death of a planned nuclear waste site at nevada 's yucca mountain has left federal agencies looking for a possible replacement .	a national laboratory working for the u.s. department of energy is now eying granite deposits stretching from georgia to maine as potential sites , along with big sections of minnesota and wisconsin where that rock is prevalent .	three decades after the 1982 nuclear waste policy act said the federal government would handle disposal of high-level radioactive waste , the united states still has no agreed-upon solution for where and how to dispose of about 70,000 metric tons of it .	about 10 percent is from the military 's nuclear weapons programs ; most of the rest is piling up at commercial reactor sites around the country .	amendments to the law in 1987 designated yucca mountain as the only potential site to be studied .	but with senate majority leader harry reid of nevada vehemently opposed , barack obama 's administration last year directed the energy department to withdraw its license application for the site , which was filed with the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission .	the new study was done by the sandia national laboratory in new mexico , an offshoot of the u.s. nuclear weapons program that has grown to work on a variety of federal science projects , including yucca mountain .	the lab now is operated under government contract by sandia corp. , a subsidiary of defense giant lockheed martin corp. .	the study , which received little notice when it was released in august , said that with yucca mountain no longer in the picture , " other disposal environments in the u.s. are once again being investigated , including disposal in granite . "	exposure to high-level radioactive waste can be lethal , and the material needs to be isolated for at least thousands of years while its radioactivity dissipates .	one court decision related to the decadeslong controversy over yucca mountain specified an isolation period of 1 million years ?	about five times as long as homo sapiens has existed on earth , according to the american museum of natural history .	andrew orrell , director of nuclear energy and fuel cycle programs at sandia , said it would be premature for anyone to be concerned about a high-level radioactive waste site coming to their neighborhood . "	there is no leading candidate ( among potential sites ) of any kind , because there is no program at the moment for siting repositories , " orrell said in a phone interview .	john keeley , a spokesman for the nuclear energy institute , an industry group , said there is also no effort in congress to break the logjam .	the situation currently is characterized by " inertia , " he said .	several factors should put people at ease , orrell said .	while the obama administration has mothballed yucca mountain , no process for selecting another site has been created in federal law .	the yucca license withdrawal also is being challenged in court , which could give a glimmer of hope to the project 's supporters .	the nation 's only active deep underground waste site is the waste isolation pilot project near carlsbad , new mexico , which is mainly storing plutonium from bomb-making .	local officials and residents have welcomed the economic development that has come from hosting the site , and community leaders have indicated they are open to expanding it , orrell said .	that makes the salt beds of southeast new mexico a likely long-term home for the nation 's nuclear waste if yucca mountain remains out of the picture .	orrell noted , too , that granite and salt beds are not the only type of environments under study .	sandia teams have launched similar reviews of clay and shale and deeper holes bored into the earth ?	as far as 3 miles ( 4.8 kilometers ) ?	as potential sites .	the studies have been done in part to keep skills sharp among staff who had been working on yucca mountain , orrell said .	but arnie gundersen , a former nuclear industry engineer who is now a vermont-based consultant on nuclear-related issues , called the report on granite sites " ominous . "	he pointed to factors that he said raise the likelihood of the massive granite outcroppings in rural parts of the northeast attracting attention as potential waste sites .	granite would appear to have an advantage over other environments , if the recent development of high-level waste sites in other countries is any guide .	both finland and sweden are on track to open waste sites buried deep in granite within the next 14 years .	the sandia study says that granite 's properties as a chemically and physically stable rock , with low permeability , would " strongly inhibit " radiation from reaching the outside environment if waste canisters leaked .	in addition to the appalachian mountain range and upper midwest , the study identifies several areas of the west as rich in granite deposits .	but the western regions are described as having moderate to high seismic activity .	in contrast , the northern appalachian and adirondack region , including upstate new york and new england , as well as the lake superior region of wisconsin and minnesota , are described as having little to no seismic and volcanic activity .	vermont is no stranger to the nuclear waste storage debate .	it was one of the places department of energy surveyed for potential waste sites in the mid-1980s ?	before congress targeted yucca mountain .	at one public hearing in wells river , more than 2,000 people turned out to voice their outrage at the idea .	new england has long been a hotbed of opposition to the nuclear industry .	vermont is currently being sued by entergy corp. over the state 's effort to deny a new 20-year license for the vermont yankee nuclear plant .	madeleine kunin was governor the last time a nuclear waste storage site search focused on vermont .	the letters she got and wrote in opposition ?	one resident said the proposal would " use vermonters as guinea pigs " ?	fill more than a half-dozen folders in the state archives .	kunin said recently she doubted the state would be any more welcoming now to the idea . "	absolutely not , " she said . "	my gut reaction is this would not be a good place . "	the waste should go " somewhere really isolated from inhabited land ... somewhere in the middle of nowhere . "
southern illinois landowners are suing the state for failing to implement hydraulic fracturing , calling the long-running process for adopting rules governing the oil and gas extraction method tantamount to illegal government seizure of property already leased to developers .	the lawsuit , filed wednesday in wayne county on behalf of seven households , names gov. pat quinn and illinois department of natural resources director marc miller .	it comes as the state faces a nov. 15 deadline for sorting out the rules for how developers would deploy high-volume hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " under an illinois law approved last year .	a legislative panel that has the last word on whether the rules can take effect has put off voting on them until next month as it grapples with how to ensure regulations are fair to industry while protecting the environment .	insisting that fracking has proven safe elsewhere , the attorney pressing the lawsuit , which seeks class-action status , said the state 's continuing delay in issuing permits needlessly has robbed energy-rich wayne county and the rest of the economically stressed region a would-be boost .	energy resources " just have been a godsend to that part of the state , " rod taylor , a southern illinois native and indianapolis-based attorney for the suing landowners , told the associated press on thursday . "	great people , good land and oil and gas ?	that 's about it there . " "	for the state to come in and arbitrarily curtail issuance of permits when there is no problem is troublesome , " he added . "	they have enough rules on board now to issue the permits and allow this development to go forward . "	messages left with quinn and miller spokespeople thursday were not immediately returned .	hydraulic fracturing generally uses a mixture of water , chemicals and sand to crack open rock formations thousands of feet underground to release trapped oil and gas .	opponents fear it will pollute and deplete groundwater or cause health problems .	the industry counters that the method is safe and would spur economic opportunity by tapping the region 's portion of the sprawling new albany shale formation , where they hope significant oil deposits lie 5,000 feet or more below the surface .	the law , once seen as a national model of compromise , has drawn criticism from both advocates and opponents over the rule-making process that has dragged on .	wednesday 's lawsuit claims the waiting has frustrated would-be developers who have spent millions snapping up leases on thousands of acres from southern illinois mineral-rights owners . "	the failure of defendants to issue permits for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is a taking of property without just compensation , " the lawsuit alleges . "	we 're asking a wayne county judge to declare that the state has condemned the new albany shale , and that we want a good , fair-minded jury to decide what the value of that taking is , " taylor said . "	right now , ( property owners and developers ) have been shut down , and the leases are expiring .	they did n't even have a chance to go to bat . "
a second cruise ship line has agreed to buy lobsters from local suppliers when one of its ships visits maine in september and october , u.s. rep. chellie pingree said wednesday .	celebrity cruises has agreed to purchase about 3,800 pounds of lobster when the celebrity summit visits bar harbor and portland , pingree said .	the 965-foot ship carries more than 2,000 passengers .	officials said last week that holland america line agreed to purchase locally caught lobsters for its cruise ships when they visit bar harbor several times this season .	the cruise line purchases are good news for maine 's lobster industry , which has been suffering under rock-bottom prices this summer because of a strong harvest that has resulted in an oversupply of lobsters .	although the purchases represent just a tiny amount of the catch , they could spur other cruise lines to follow suit and raise awareness about maine lobsters among cruise ship passengers , said dane somers , executive director of the maine lobster promotion council .	lobster dealers in maine have been in discussions with other cruise ship companies to see if they 'll also buy local product when they visit maine , he said . "	cruise lines are in a competitive industry .	they 're all competing and trying to give their passengers something extra , " somers said . "	if they can offer passengers fresh maine lobsters literally off the dock in the summer , that 's a treat .	i do n't think their passengers will ever forget that . "	september and october represent the busiest time of the cruise ship season in maine .	about 120 ships are scheduled to stop in bar harbor this year , with an additional 60 or so visiting portland .	cruise lines already buy large amounts of frozen lobster products , from processors in both canada and maine , somers said .	but cruise companies usually negotiate long-term contracts far in advance for their food purchases and rarely make purchases while their ships are en route , he said .	that has n't deterred pingree from writing a letter to the heads of every cruise ship company visiting portland this year , suggesting they buy live maine lobster while in the state .	in announcing celebrity cruises ' decision to buy lobster while in maine , pingree said she has also heard from another major cruise ship company that 's in talks with local lobster suppliers . "	it 's a little too early to announce more purchases but we have some good prospects and at least one company is talking specifics with suppliers and has asked for some sample product , " she said in a statement .

mississippi republican u.s. reps. steven palazzo and alan nunnelee voted against a resolution wednesday night that ended the 16-day partial government shutdown .	republican rep. gregg harper and democratic rep. bennie thompson and u.s. sens. thad cochran and roger wicker , both republicans , voted for the resolution .	palazzo said the resolution did nothing to address the patient protection and affordable care act and did nothing to reduce spending . "	the senate deal only punts the tough decisions yet again , something i find unacceptable for the future of our nation .	my colleagues and i will continue to fight to ensure a better country for our children and grandchildren , " palazzo said in a statement after the house vote .	nunnelee agreed , saying the deal failed to address the problems congress was elected to fix including the health care law and the national debt .

" "	while it does n't fix the problems associated with ' obamacare , ' it is important for congress to reopen the government , not default on our bills , and get this crisis behind us , " he said .	thompson said the " burden placed on seniors , veterans , our financial markets and communities due to an unnecessary government shutdown have been too great . " "	moving forward with the senate deal to put americans back to work , ending the government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling is the best direction for our country , and i will continue working to build mississippi and our country , " he said .	harper said while he was not satisfied with the agreement , it was in the best interest of the country " to end the shutdown and ensure that our debts are paid . " "	we could not risk default .	the people of mississippi 's third congressional district sent me to washington to work for them , and part of my job is to help ensure a functioning government , " he said .	cochran said the bipartisan agreement to reopen the federal government and prevent risking the nation 's credit worthiness should be followed with concrete steps toward " a long-term agreement that will reduce our debt through structural changes to government spending . " "	it is important that we act to restore the confidence of the american people in the united states senate .	we must take real steps to strengthen our nation 's fiscal foundation so that our economy can grow , and american families and businesses can prosper , " cochran said .
we 're about to do the most evil thing this town has ever seen . "	murder defendant steven spader is said to have uttered those words as he and three other teens allegedly drove to a house they had targeted in this town of 2,000 to burglarize it and kill its occupants for the thrill of it .	spader 's trial begins monday , and jurors were put on notice during selection that they would see graphic photos of the victims and may hear from survivor jaimie cates , now 12 .	they were prepared for attorneys on the other side not to even put on their own witnesses .	many potential jurors were disqualified after saying they were sure spader was guilty , or were terrified by the crime and the prospect of viewing the evidence .	some said they would be skeptical if spader 's lawyers did not put on evidence of their own .	in mont vernon , the trial is reawakening the brutal crime that longtime resident and state rep. linda foster said " ripped at the heart and soul of a sweet little new england town . " "	i do n't think you ever get over it , but i think the trial just means everything will get stirred up again , " said susan king ecklund as she and other volunteers planted bulbs in front of the fire station last week . "	it just rocks everybody . "	the intruders cut power to the contemporary ranch-style home before dawn oct. 4 , 2009 .	once inside , they used an ipod taken from jaimie cates ' room to illuminate their path to the master bedroom , where jaimie and her mother , 42-year-old kimberly cates , slept .	jaimie 's father , david cates , was away on a business trip .	prosecutors say spader , then 17 , and christopher gribble , then 19 , hacked mother and daughter with a machete and a knife , killing kimberly and severely wounding jaimie .	the girl survived by feigning death as her assailants continued to slash and kick her , she told police .	jaimie , who had achieved a black belt in karate just four months earlier , called police from a cell phone and was still conscious when milford sgt. kevin furlong arrived at the house . "	they killed my mommy , " she told him , according to a state police affidavit .	two other teens in the house at the time , william marks and quinn glover , have reached plea agreements and are expected to testify against spader .	prosecutors say they witnessed but did not take part in the attacks .	gribble is set to go to trial in february .	it was marks who wrote a friend from prison about spader 's alleged " most evil thing " statement en route to the house , and a prosecutor quoted the letter during marks ' plea hearing .	david and jaimie cates still live at the house , but the facade is different from a year ago .	the front yard is anchored by the low-cut stumps of old growth pines that cates had leveled .	a woman who answered the door at the home last week said no one wanted to speak to a reporter .	jurors are scheduled to tour the cates property monday .	they will not be taken inside the home .	spader is charged with first-degree murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder and witness tampering .	he faces life in prison without possibility of parole if convicted of murder .	midway through jury selection , spader buzz-cut his shaggy black hair , bringing his appearance back to the skinhead look he had when arrested just days after the crime .	spader often smiles and interacts with his lawyers .	during a hearing on a defense motion to limit the number of photographs depicting injuries to the victims , spader stared intently at the pictures as defense attorney andrew winters shuffled through them , often cocking his head to get a better angle .	defense attorney jonathan cohen would not comment on the defense strategy except to say , " he 's presumed innocent .	they have to prove he 's guilty , and we intend to put them to their burden .

sebastian wessels sat in his " ham shack " ?	basically a children 's playhouse in his yard that he 's converted to the base for his amateur radio operations ?	and tweaked a dial .	out of the speakers came two japanese voices having a conversation with each other . "	the last guy i talked to was in grenada , " said wessels , a south african native who has had his ham radio license since 1991 .	then he still lived in his native land ; he got an american license when he moved to the u.s. in 1996 .	wessels is a database administrator for ibm by trade and a self-described " ham , " as amateur radio operators call themselves .	the tiny building he operates out of ?	with a " ham shack " sign posted outside ?	is jammed with all manner of hardware , cables and computer screens .	one of those displays a computer program he has that tracks , automatically , all of the people all over the world he 's talked to , and , when he communicates with someone new , brings up information on that person based on their call sign .	if the phrase " ham radio " seems like a blast from the past in this age of the internet and smartphones , think again : according to the latest numbers from the national association for amateur radio , there were 704,236 amateur radio license holders in the u.s. as of march 2012 , an all-time high .	that figure is up from 662,600 in 2005 .	but is it a hobby that is being embraced by young people ?	that depends on who you talk to . "	we 're having trouble getting them into it , " said jerry schmidt , secretary of the longmont amateur radio club . "	when i look back over my time , i was into amateur radio in 1963 . "	schmidt 's group is doing what it can to attract younger members , including attending boy scout gatherings to talk about the hobby .	they do have a few offspring of larc members who have expressed an interest as well , he said .	the boulder amateur radio club , on the other hand , has a program called barc juniors geared specifically toward youth ages 6 to 18 .	ellie van winkle and her husband , " rip , " co-founded barc juniors after hearing a presentation many years ago given by young hams at the annual " hamvention , " the amateur radio convention held in dayton , ohio . "	they had a forum , " ellie van winkle said . "	the children talked , not the adults .	the children talked and said , ' this is what we do . ' "	she was so inspired that upon returning to boulder she and her husband launched the barc juniors program , which is now in its 21st year .	serving as " elmers , " ham radio 's expression for teachers , or mentors , the couple have helped more than 200 young people get their amateur licenses over the years .	and membership in barc juniors has remained fairly consistent over the years , she said . "	we 've been up to three dozen and we 're at 24 now , " van winkle said .	wessels pursues his hobby dx-style , dx being a ham 's term for long-distance communication .	he 's a member of the american radio relay league 's dx century club , meaning he 's communicated with other hams in at least 100 other " entities . " "	it 's all about bragging rights , " wessels said . "	it 's not really countries . "	in the world of dx , he explained , the u.s. actually consists of nine entities .	there are 350 of them globally , and the goal of a dxer is to communicate with as many of these entities as possible , and the more remote the better .	dx magazine puts out a list of the " most wanted " spots around the globe for dxers .	at no. 1 is north korea .	the no. 2 is a site within u.s. territory : navassa island , which is off the coast of cuba .	it 's no. 2 because it 's a fish and wildlife preserve , so hams ?	and especially their antennas ?	are n't exactly welcome . "	i really started the dx part of the ( hobby ) , the distance part of this deal , about five years ago when we moved to this location , " said wessels , who lives just outside longmont .	ham radio operates on line-of-sight communication , and from inside his shack he directs his large antennae to a part of the globe he wants to talk to .	atmospheric conditions and whether he 's beaming his signal over land or see can affect his signal strength , he said .	as a demonstration wessels communicated with a german man who was broadcasting out of belize .	he 'd never worked that " call " ?	short for call sign , all-important in the ham radio world ?	before , so for wessels it was another contact to add to the list .	it was not such a big deal for the german guy , wessels said , to talk with someone in colorado . "	for him it 's easy , " wessels said . "	everybody wants to talk to belize ; there 's hardly anybody there .	in the u.s. , you have 700,000 people ?	in belize you have about 20 people . "	the u.s. is second in the world in terms of ham licenses .	japan is no. 1 with about a million .	there are about 2.5 million licensees globally .	schmidt loves ham radio for reasons completely different from wessels ' . "	i view the hobby more from a public safety standpoint , " said schmidt , whose activities with the board include making preparations for the group 's annual larcfest , which this year will be the first week of april .	he is also a member of bcares .	the boulder/broomfield county amateur radio emergency services group is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year , and its upcoming annual meeting is jan. 28 . "	the last ( event ) we did was the holiday parade ( in longmont ) , " schmidt said . "	we had six or eight hams out there along the parade route .	if anything went crazy we could radio back to the leadership . "	bcares has antennas set up on the top of the longmont police station and longmont united hospital , and it has an antennae and a workspace inside the boulder office of emergency management . "	we have used them for everything from being our ears , or our communication , from a shelter site ?	when we have a temporary shelter set up , " said merrie leach , the emergency management coordinator with the boulder oem . "	they would just be there to act as radio communication for the shelter site , because the red cross does n't necessarily come with radios . "	for example , during the four mile fire , the coors events center on the cu-boulder campus was used as a shelter , and hams were able to let the oem know when the shelter was getting full , or if items such as blankets or water needed to be delivered . "	they have video crews that can go out with cameras and let us know what 's going on at a particular disaster site , " leach said . "	video is especially important . "	last year they helped with siren testing .	( it helped ) having a group of trusted volunteers go out and say , ' ok , this is how they behaved . ' "	the year after the four mile fire , allen bishop , chairman of the bcares board , founded mern , the mountain emergency radio network , schmidt said .	as someone who lived in the four mile burn area , bishop understood how important maintaining communications were during such a horrific event , schmidt said . "	in emergencies , you lose the infrastructure , and our goal , as a ham radio operator , is to be able to operate without the infrastructure , " schmidt said .	added leach , " it has increased ( mountain ) communities ' and boulder county 's communications capacity so much that it has really made those mountain communities that much more resilient . "	as we talk to our colleagues in other areas ( around the state ) about that , we can really see how fortunate we are to have the relationships that we have with , really , all of the agencies and the organizations like ( bcares ) around here .

after years of being passed over for single-variety wines such as cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir , a new wave of blended red wines made in a crowd-pleaser style ?	and priced at a budget-friendly $ 9 to $ 12 a bottle ?	is winning favor with consumers . "	they 're drinking the red blends , " says doug bell , national wine and beer buyer for whole foods market .	the wines tend to be " kind of plush , very fruity , very smooth , " and offer an alternative to consumers who want to try red wines but are n't looking for the traditional single-grape varieties .	wines made from more than one red grape are n't new , of course .	the classic bordeaux blends from france generally are made from a blend of six grapes , with the predominant grapes being cabernet sauvignon , cabernet franc and merlot .	and even single-variety wines are n't necessarily pure .	by law , they can contain up to 25 percent of a grape different from what 's listed on the label .	the blends making news in the united states often incorporate the new world grape zinfandel , as well as syrah , which hails from france but has become more associated with the new world , especially australia .	red blends started getting trendy about two years ago , with brands such as menage a trois , made from three red grapes .	some popular blends at whole foods include frey agriculturist , a california wine that is a blend of carignan , merlot and syrah , and innovac!on shiraz cabernet from argentina along with innovac!on tempranillo-malbec .	roy cecchetti , cofounder of cecchetti wine co. , also based in sonoma county , expects the red blend wine category to continue to grow over the next 18 to 24 months .	he 's launched a blend called exitus ( latin for departure ) that retails for $ 25 .	the 2010 blend combines three grapes from california ?	central coast syrah , petite sirah from the mendocino coast and merlot from lake county .	cecchetti theorizes that red blends are attractive to consumers as a new option . "	most all red varietals have been overexposed , " he says . "	red blends give the consumer the opportunity of trying something completely different based on the varying flavor profiles of the red blends that are currently available . "	another recent entry in the category is echelon red blend , part of the california series of wines from sonoma county based echelon vineyards .	the 2010 vintage is primarily a blend of cabernet sauvignon and merlot with a few other red grapes that winemaker kurt lorenzi calls the " secret sauce . "	echelon 's red blend , which has a suggested retail price of $ 13.99 , is on the drier end of the spectrum and its makeup depends on lorenzi . "	cabernet sauvignon 's important , but we 're not wed to varieties , " he says . "	we 're going to put out a great red blend . "
@ by william m. welch usa today los angeles - a magnitude-7 .2 earthquake just across the border in mexico rocked buildings from los angeles to phoenix on sunday , but there were no reports of major damage .	the quake struck at 3:40 p.m. pacific time in baja california , mexico , about 16 miles southwest of the town of guadalupe victoria .	u.s. officials said they were still trying to get reports of potential damage near the center of the quake .	its center was 108 miles east of tijuana , mexico , just across the border from san diego .	robert valadez of el centro , calif. , said the earthquake woke him from his afternoon sleep before he was to go to work at a 7-eleven store . "	everything fell down , " said valadez , a cashier . "	my tv 's broken right now , my computer fell down .	all the cabinets , the doors opened and all the cups and everything from the cabinets , everything is broken . "	arizona state university student kari mcbride , 20 , who works at st. joseph 's medical center in phoenix , said the quake shook the pediatric intensive care unit . "	you could feel the entire building shaking , " she said . "	there were iv bags jittering on the poles and the floor was moving . "	the children at the hospital were confused but not scared , she said .	cal tech seismologist egill hauksson said the quake appeared to have been centered 6 miles underground .	he said scientists had not yet identified which of an array of fault lines was involved .	scientists were hampered by the lack of u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) earthquake sensors south of the border with mexico and were using computers to analyze data from u.s.-based sensors .	hauksson said computer analysis suggested " severe to violent " shaking strong enough to cause major damage within 20 miles of the center .	sara hernandez , 47 , of imperial , calif. , was eating a late easter lunch outside at her parents ' home in calipatria , about 25 miles to the north of imperial , when the party of 15 people felt the ground rumble and sway . "	my dad 's truck was swaying form side to side , you could see it bouncing off the ground , " hernandez said .	her father 's pre-fabricated carport was " literally bouncing off the ground . "	in tijuana , city spokeswoman maricarmen viera said there were no reports of injuries or death but that the quake caused cracks in some buildings including city hall .	four people were rescued when they were trapped in a hotel elevator , and some electrical lines were down . "	other than that , we 've seen no damage , " viera said . "	this was a strong one , but fortunately we 've never had a really devastating earthquake in tijuana . "	photographs posted on twitter showed damage to buildings in mexicali , just north of the earthquake center , and a gash that had opened across a city street .	more than two dozen smaller quakes were recorded in the hours after the 7.2 quake , including some as large as 5.4 magnitude in the california desert areas near the mexican border .	a small quake in northern california , near santa rosa , was not related , the usgs said .	the quake was one of the strongest felt in southern california in decades and stirred memories of 1994 's magnitude-6 .7 earthquake at northridge in the san fernando valley .	that quake did extensive damage , and at least 60 people were killed .

a former state representative who was recently fined $ 18,000 for ethics violations , including for living in his office , has signaled interest in running for the state senate .	former rep. alan dick , whose last listed address was in nenana , has filed a letter of intent with the state to challenge state sen. click bishop , r-fairbanks , for the senate district c seat in the august republican primary .	filing such an intent allows a candidate to begin raising funds .	however , a declaration of candidacy would have to be filed with the state division of elections to have a candidate 's name appear on the ballot , the fairbanks daily news-miner reported ( http://bit.ly/1lkseaq ) .	a legislative ethics committee announced last september that it had found dick in violation of five allegations , including using state resources for his personal benefit by living in his fairbanks legislative office with his wife and sometimes his son , off and on in august 2012 and for about a month between mid-october and mid-november of 2012 .	he was ordered to pay nearly $ 18,000 .	the panel found that dick performed campaign activities out of his legislative office in the lead-up to the 2012 general election and required a legislative staffer on government time to prepare materials for a chamber debate .	it also found what it called numerous violations related to dick 's 2012 legislative travel , saying that he " routinely " combined legislative travel with campaign activities , which is prohibited .	dick was known for his plain speaking and off-the-cuff remarks during his short term in the legislature .	he apologized after suggesting in march 2012 that a woman should get a signed permission slip from the father of the fetus before undergoing the procedure .	bishop , a former state labor commissioner , won election in 2012 .	while a member of the republican majority , he broke several times from the caucus to vote with moderate republicans and democrats on such issues as school vouchers , a contentious permitting bill and a measure determining how many members comprise the judicial council .	the news-miner reports his opposition to a few of these conservative issues brought bishop pressure from hard-right conservatives but praise from moderates .

change is a work toward stability at the wyoming department of education .	at least that 's according to new state superintendent of public instruction jillian balow .	she recently took over the agency from former state superintendent cindy hill , who chose not to run for re-election . "	in our first days in office , we 've been very focused on stabilizing and strengthening what is already there , " said balow , a republican from cheyenne .	in addition to seeking to stabilize the department , she is working to fill open staff positions , increase the department 's proactive work and build relationships with school districts , the state board of education and legislators .	currently , she said , she is in the process of defining a " vision of a vision " and putting together a strategic plan for the department .	the document is a work in progress , she said .	it is partly based on a widespread survey her administration put forth to those involved in education statewide . "	folks are concerned for a number of different reasons about assessment , curriculum , quality teaching , and retaining and recruiting the very best teachers , " balow said . "	i would anticipate that as we go forward building this vision for wyoming education , that some of those issues that were identified in the survey and strategic planning will continue to be front and center as we set goals for education . "	a goal of the planning process will be to make the department into a more proactive agency , rather than a purely reactive one , she told the wyoming tribune eagle .	since the november election , balow said , she has been putting together leadership teams of former and current educators in the state . "	almost immediately after the election , we put together a team including former gov. ( jim ) geringer , former superintendent judy catchpole , two former school district superintendents and a current district administrator and really got a lay of the land as far as what 's going on in education , " she said . "	we asked them to go boots on the ground and talk to as many folks as they could . "	balow also has tried to reach out to different groups involved with education , including school districts , the wyoming association of school administrators , the wyoming education association , the state board of education and legislators .	all are " working on rebuilding and renewing those relationships , so that we 're all partners in education and can recognize that common vision , " she said .	throughout the current legislative session , the department will be " triaging " the bills coming through , balow said .	the focus will be on bills that relate to students . "	during a legislative session especially , it 's tempting to be reactive and kind of jump or speak at whatever the de jour is , " she said . "	but we want to be really conscientious about moving forward with the bigger vision . "	some of the bills the department is watching include those that deal with standards , accountability and testing , she said .	she added that she is supporting a repeal of the footnote that ended consideration of the next generation science standards and ultimately halted work on revising the state 's science standards . "	i support the repeal because we need to be able to talk about science standards .	but ... there 's a huge ' but , ' " balow said . "	that is this : when the footnote , or if the footnote , is repealed , we can not put the next generation science standards right in front of the state board of education for adoption . "	instead , she said there needs to be a process to allow people from across the state to comment on standards development . "	we want to make sure that we work together on an inclusive process that ensures that we have wyoming standards for wyoming kids , " she said . "	we need to have high , rigorous science standards , but we also need to make sure that we have an inclusive process that ensures we have wyoming 's standards . "	within the department , balow said she has been working to both make sure that the right people are in the right positions and to start filling positions . "	there are about 34 vacancies at the department of education , so truly , in almost every area of the department , folks are trying hard to just fulfill the basic responsibilities of their job , oftentimes doing the job of two or three people , " she said . "	so it is a priority to make sure that we 're operating at capacity , so we can do our jobs . "	the process of filling all of the open positions may take six months to a year , she said .	but to fill some of them , including those in her leadership team , she is looking to school districts . "	the school districts have been incredibly benevolent and cooperative , and it is no small task to pull people out mid-year , " she said . "	we are so grateful to the school districts across the state that recognize this greater mission of strengthening and stabilizing the department of education . "	a benefit of looking to district employees is that their involvement will help building the department 's intuitional and historical knowledge , balow said .	within the department , there also already has been some reorganization , she said .	but most of it has been at the leadership or administrative level .	the work has n't gone further into the organization at this point because there needs to be staff input , she said .	also , the legislature may indicate changes or priorities that need additional staff attention . "	leadership is much less about authority and power , and much more about facilitating a vision , " balow said . "	i 'm humbled to have that opportunity to facilitate a vision with so many incredible educators and leaders across our state . "

a candidate for north dakota school superintendent abruptly withdrew from the race wednesday , saying he had changed his mind for personal reasons and because a state gop official strongly discouraged him from running .	republican keith jacobson , a retired new salem school administrator , said the north dakota republican vice chairman , jim poolman , called him shortly after he read a news account that jacobson had filed nominating petitions tuesday to seek the superintendent 's job .	north dakota republicans voted to support another candidate , kirsten baesler , of mandan , during their state convention in bismarck earlier this month .	jacobson ran for superintendent of public instruction in 2004 , losing to incumbent democrat wayne sanstead .	he said he did not compete for this year 's endorsement in part because he expected state rep. david monson , r-osnabrock , to win it .	baesler defeated monson , 863-725 , getting 54 percent of the delegate votes .	monson , a former house speaker and assistant gop majority leader , is a retired teacher and school administrator .	baesler is an assistant principal in the bismarck schools and president of the mandan school board . "	i really had expected dave monson to get the nomination .	i support dave , " jacobson said .	when that did not happen , jacobson said , " i thought , maybe i 'm the most qualified person here , with all my background in administration . "	it takes petition signatures from 300 north dakota voters to run for superintendent of public instruction .	jacobson turned in his petitions tuesday afternoon , and got a call soon after from poolman .	jacobson declined to discuss what was said .	he and poolman spoke about the race several times in the past few days , jacobson said , which poolman confirmed . "	i could n't care less if ( poolman ) calls me again or not , " jacobson said . "	i 'm all done talking to the republican party . "	poolman said he and jacobson talked about " the political implications for the race " if jacobson got in .	at present , baesler and two democrats , max laird and tracy potter , will be competing in the nonpartisan june 12 primary .	the top two finishers will run against each other in the november general election .	republicans hope laird , who won the support of democratic convention delegates last month , and potter , a former bismarck democratic state senator and u.s. senate candidate , will split the democratic vote and help assure baesler a fall campaign spot .	laird has run two statewide campaigns and potter one , while baesler is competing in her first . "	i think if you start splitting up the vote four ways , it becomes more difficult that way to gauge any sort of outcome , " poolman said wednesday .	he called jacobson " a friend , and we have been friends since he ran eight years ago . "	poolman said he " did n't think it was inappropriate " to discourage jacobson from running .

gov. chris christie said wednesday that he is willing to consider further changes to help new jersey children with a rare form of epilepsy access medical marijuana after legal changes he approved last year did not make it available to them .	he said he may be willing to require dispensaries to supply the appropriate strain but remains unwilling to consider legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana . "	i 'm open to making those changes but what i fear is that a lot of people use really tragic circumstances as an excuse to say , ' let 's legalize , ' " he said . "	i 've got to walk that line and i 'm going to try to walk that line with you . "	he made the concession at a town hall meeting when he was confronted by the mother of a 15-month-old girl who died in december after a seizure caused by dravet syndrome , a form of epilepsy that is rare and often fatal .	paula joana said afterward that her daughter , sabina rose joana , would still be alive if a certain strain of marijuana were available in edible form in new jersey .	she said that it controls seizures in a way that pharmaceutical drugs do not .	none of the state 's three legal dispensaries have it .	christie said he believes that is because the demand is so low that the dispensaries ?	technically nonprofits ?	would not make money producing it .	he said that is a reason he would prefer the drug be made available only through hospitals .	medical marijuana advocates have pushed christie for more access for years .	just before he took office , predecessor jon corzine signed a law allowing medical marijuana in the state .	it took nearly three years before the first dispensary in new jersey was open .	last year , the parents of another little girl with dravet became leaders in a push to allow edible forms of cannabis for kids with conditions that qualified them to use the drug under the state 's law and to end a restriction that allowed each dispensary to grow only three strains .	christie agreed to that , but he did not agree to the other item brian and meghan wilson asked for : access to the drug with fewer doctor approvals for children .	when christie made the changes last year , he indicated he was reluctant to go farther than that .	the wilson 's , with their daughter , vivian , have since moved to colorado , where a low-thc form of marijuana given to children with dravet is available in an edible form .	and sabia rose joana has become the new face of the issue .	her mother has called christie 's office frequently but had not spoken with him directly until wednesday .	ken wolski , director of the coalition for medical marijuana of new jersey , said wednesday that he is glad to hear christie say that the changes made last year have not worked , but he remains skeptical that the governor will take action that will help patients . "	we 're looking for some program that works , " he said .	he said his group now supports legalization of all marijuana .

wal-mart stores inc. said monday that it is adding the former chairman of accounting firm kpmg international chairman to its board , effective immediately .	tim flynn , 55 , will become the board 's 17th member and is also joining the audit committee .	the move comes as the world 's largest retailer attempts to regain shareholder trust following a bribery scandal in mexico .	in late april , the new york times reported that wal-mart 's mexican unit allegedly paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors , and that executives did n't notify authorities even after wal-mart found evidence of the scheme during a probe dating to 2005 .	the bribery allegations have led to federal investigations in the u.s. and mexico , as well as a global anti-corruption compliance review by wal-mart .	they also have spawned about a dozen shareholder lawsuits seeking changes in wal-mart 's corporate governance and damages on behalf of the bentonville , arkansas , company from current and former executives and directors .	following the scandal , some shareholders have called for the removal of several board members , including chairman robson walton , ceo mike duke and former ceo lee scott .	but all three were re-elected to the board at the company 's annual meeting in june .	still , almost 13 percent of votes went against walton ; 13.1 percent against duke and 15.6 percent against scott .	descendants of wal-mart 's founder own about 50 percent of wal-mart 's shares , so there was little chance of activist shareholders voting out the board members .	but those tallies showed unprecedented dissent .	flynn spent 32 years at kpmg and became international chairman in 2007 .	he retired in 2011 .	wal-mart shares rose 63 cents to $ 75.15 in morning trading .

the press likes to cast itself as society 's guardian .	on monday , the judge leading the investigation into britain 's deepening phone hacking scandal vowed to find an answer to the question : who guards the guardians ?	for years , the british media 's answer has been that it mainly looks after itself .	but following explosive allegations of pervasive criminality at rupert murdoch 's news of the world tabloid , lord justice brian leveson suggested it was time for a change . "	guarding the guardians is not an optional add-on , " he said .	britain 's phone hacking inquiry was set up by prime minister david cameron shortly after the scandal boiled over in july , pulling the lid off illegal spying at the nation 's best-selling sunday newspaper and exposing police corruption .	it 's one of several investigations spurred by public anger over unethical practices at the now defunct paper .	the long-running scandal has threatened murdoch 's global media empire , which includes the wall street journal and dozens of other properties .	parallel inquiries launched by police , prosecutors and parliamentarians have called murdoch to britain for dramatic testimony before lawmakers , led to more than a dozen arrests and the resignation of several top-ranking murdoch executives , including news international ceo rebekah brooks and the wall street journal publisher les hinton .	the first part of leveson 's inquiry seeks to go beyond assigning blame to individual journalists or newspapers to evaluate the media 's wider role : is the press above the law ?	is it too close to police and politicians ?	does society 's guardian need a powerful guardian of its own ?	these are some of the questions on his agenda .	although the news of the world has few defenders , editors and broadcast bosses have publicly voiced concern that recommendations from any inquiry could leave britain 's press less aggressive ?	and less free .	few if any want more government regulation ?	especially since britain 's press already labors under strict libel laws and contentious new privacy rules .	while inquiry counsel robert jay said that the importance of a free press was " almost self-evident , " he warned that the media may not necessarily like the solutions the inquiry finds for tricky ethical issues . "	these solutions will not necessarily have been the solutions which the press themselves would have devised , " he said .	leveson said he hoped to have the first part of his inquiry wrapped up by the end of 2012 .	he 's expected to recommend either scrapping or radically reforming the press complaints commission , the self-regulatory body whose failure to get to grips with the hacking scandal has been roundly criticized .	the scope of his inquiry 's recommendations will hinge in part on whether illegal behavior is found to have been limited largely to the news of the world or whether it was practiced more widely .	there seemed to be plenty of evidence that shady practices were widespread at monday 's hearing .	jay told the inquiry ?	whose proceedings were broadcast live over the internet ?	that it appeared that illegal interception of voicemails went beyond the news of the world .	he said that the inquiry had seen the names of no fewer than 28 news international employees in the notes kept by glenn mulcaire , the private investigator which the news of the world paid to illegally eavesdrop on its victims .	the words " the sun " ?	a possible reference to the news of the world 's sister-title ?	also cropped up in mulcaire 's notes , jay said .	so , too , did a name linked to the daily mirror , the sun 's left-wing rival .	jay said that the evidence on phone hacking pointed to what he described as " at the very least , a thriving cottage industry . "	the inquiry was briefly disrupted when david sherborne , a lawyer for phone hacking victims , said that a trojan , or data-stealing virus , had been found on his computer ?	raising the possibly that he was being hacked .	the otherwise cool and clinical leveson briefly seemed speechless . "	i 'm not often thrown , but mr. sherborne has managed to do that , " he said .	sherborne later said the problem was being dealt with .	sherborne was one of several dozen lawyers and journalists packed into a room at london 's neo-gothic royal courts of justice , with more in a spillover tent pitched into a nearby courtyard .	a handful of members of the public came to watch the proceedings as well ?	among them bob dowler , whose daughter milly had her phone hacked by the news of the world at the height of the media frenzy over her disappearance in 2002 .	dowler 's case was the first to arouse broad public anger when it was reported by the guardian newspaper in july , though several celebrities had earlier won settlements from news international .	among the people who will be legally represented at the hearings are " harry potter " author j.k. rowling , singer charlotte church , actor hugh grant and actress sienna miller .	katriona ormiston , a 21-year-old journalism student , said she was there to see media history being made .

the new york public interest research group compiled the report and said the findings show that new york 's campaign-finance laws have a critical loophole : lobbyists have no specific restrictions on campaign contributions , unlike in 31 states . "	we want lobbyists to be measured by their depth of their knowledge of the issues , not by the width of their checkbooks , " said blair horner , nypirg 's legislative director .	the group , a registered lobbyist themselves , looked at contributions from december 2008 through january of this year from the state 's 50 largest lobbying firms .	most contributions went to the state 's most powerful officials and committees , with democratic gubernatorial candidate andrew cuomo 's campaign bringing in the most at $ 320,540 .	horner said the legislature needs to pass stiffer rules governing the donations , pointing out how the other 31 states impose tougher campaign-contribution restrictions on lobbyists than other individuals because of potential conflicts of interest .	in new york , lobbyists are bound to the same campaign-finance rules as other new yorkers , who can contribute up to $ 150,000 total per year to campaigns .	horner said the state should enact a law similar to massachusetts , which allows lobbyists to contribute just $ 200 per calendar year , and only to politicians that represent them .	the state 's largest lobbying firm , wilson elser moskowitz edelman & dicker llp , contributed $ 274,160 to different political campaigns , the most of any firm in the state , according to the report .	steve greenberg , a spokesman for the firm , said wilson elser contributes to campaigns because they " are very much interested in the government process in new york .	the firm represents dozens of clients throughout the state . "	wilson elser is the largest lobbying firm in new york state , and they also happen to be the largest contributor , but they do it in accordance with the law and fully report all of their contributions , " greenburg said .	the second-highest contributor , brown mcmahon & weinraub llc , gave $ 199,585 to various campaigns .	david weinraub , a partner with the firm , declined comment .	the report also found that several former elected officials who are now registered lobbyists contributed nearly $ 143,000 from their still active campaign accounts , including $ 40,250 from former state senator nick spano , a republican who represented parts of westchester county .	spano is now the president of empire state planning , a lobbying group .	after cuomo , gov. david paterson 's now-suspended campaign received the next highest amount of lobbyist contributions with $ 218,994 .	paterson gave up his bid for election in february amid several scandals .	the state democratic senate campaign committee received the third-highest amount , bringing in $ 158,766 .	the head of the committee , sen. jeff klein , d-bronx , received $ 40,000 in his campaign account from the firms , the most of any individual senator , according to the report . "	this is just a small snapshot of the fact that a wide array of new yorkers continue to support democrats and their effort to end the years of dysfunction and corruption featured by republican rule , " said davidson goldin , a spokesman for the committee .	cuomo 's spokesman josh vlasto said cuomo , the state 's attorney general , is free of any outside influence . "	if andrew cuomo 's record could be summed up in one word , it would be independence , " vlasto said . "	he has never shied away from taking on the tough fights on behalf of all new yorkers . "	others receiving contributions from lobbyists were the monroe county democratic committee , with $ 21,750 , and sen. thomas libous , r-binghamton , whose campaign account took in $ 16,375 .	the campaign for assemblyman joseph morelle , d-irondequoit , monroe county , received $ 15,919 , the report found .	horner said it was no coincidence that the bulk of contributions were directed at statewide officials and the conference that holds the majority in the senate . "	lobbyist money definitely flows to power , " horner said .	for more information on the report , visit www.nypirg.org .
nearly four years after buying the montgomery building at auction , the owner of one of spartanburg 's most recognizable structures says it still is searching for a partner to pump new life into the property .	situated at the corner of church and east st. john streets , the montgomery building 's future has been in limbo since florida-based cypress lending group acquired the property at a foreclosure auction in june 2007 .	cypress bid $ 1.9 million for the building after spartanburg businessman arthur cleveland defaulted on a $ 2.7 million loan .	donnie love , a spartanburg preservation architect , said it would cost about $ 20 million to redevelop the building and the former theater . "	it 's one of the most important buildings in spartanburg , to be sure , " love said . "	it would require quite a bit of money to pull it off , but it would be worth it for the city and the county . "	the montgomery building is within walking distance of downtown , the chapman cultural center , barnet park , the new st. john street parking garage and the new university of south carolina upstate business school , " the george . "	cypress lending president bob grammen said the group has been close to finalizing deals , but they have fallen through at the last minute .	its proximity to the george makes the montgomery building a good fit for student housing , grammen said . "	we 're still evaluating that possibility , " he said . "	we 're open to doing the right thing there .	we think student apartments would be a good fit for the city , and we have a lot of respect for what the city has done in terms of redevelopment and investment in the renaissance park area .	and we 're still hoping to attract the right investor . "	grammen said the lending markets are starting to become more flexible after a few tough years .	in order for the montgomery building to make a good return on investment , developers would need to extensively renovate the historic building , he said . "	what we need is someone to step up to make this a good , solid deal that 's a permanent solution for everyone , " he said . "	it 's a beautiful building that needs extensive work , but it would be great to have retail on the first floor . "	love recently went inside the montgomery building and said structurally , the building is in good condition . "	the historic fabric is still there , and there 's an opportunity to reclaim the montgomery building with the skylights and the theater .	there 's a lot that 's still there , " love said .	the montgomery building was built in the mid-1920s and became home to the carolina theatre .	it is a " chicago-frame skyscraper , " the first of its kind built in the state , love said .	it was designed by lockwood greene in 1923 , which also had been hired to build the evans building .	lockwood greene , now ch2m hill , had been based in boston , but moved into the montgomery building when it was complete , he said .	city manager ed memmott said student housing with offices on the second floor and retail on the first level would likely be a sustainable option for the building . "	the city anticipates reuse of the building eventually , and we want to be as helpful as we can to the owners as they look for options , " memmott said .	the city 's master plan states that a redeveloped montgomery building is essential to connecting the marriott at renaissance park and wofford college to morgan square .	eventually , the building would turn a dead zone perceived as unsafe into an enjoyable walking environment , according to the master plan . "	the montgomery building as a historic landmark is critical to the fabric of downtown , " the plan said .
andy martin , a.k.a. anthony martin-trigona , is a legend in his own mind .	he is a self-proclaimed " corruption fighter , " '' internet powerhouse " and " republican foreign policy expert . "	martin is not a lawyer but he is a serial litigator ?	a " notoriously vexatious and vindictive " one , in the words of one federal appeals court opinion .	he is currently trying to get a new hampshire judge to undo the sale of the balsams grand hotel and appoint a receiver to reopen it immediately .	he has volunteered his services to be that receiver .	the 66-year-old martin has twice run for president of the united states and earlier this month apologized to gop presidential nominee mitt romney for not endorsing him sooner .	martin says his lawsuit in honolulu instigated the " birther movement " that challenges the validity of president barack obama 's hawaiian birth certificate and background .	he says he plans to return to hawaii later this month for further investigation . "	he 's the greatest snake oil salesman in history , " martin said of obama during a 90-minute interview with the associated press last week .	he is executive director of the anti-obama website committeeofonemilliontodefeatbarackobama.com .	martin graduated from the university of illinois law school in 1973 but was denied admission to the bar because he " lacks the qualities of responsibility , candor , fairness , self-restraint , objectivity and respect for the judicial system , " according to one federal court ruling .	the chicago tribune , in a profile of martin three years ago , said the illinois supreme court ?	in denying his admission to the bar ?	also cited a selective service report that stated martin has a " moderately severe character defect manifested by well-documented ideation with a paranoid flavor and grandiose character . "	that profile was triggered by a radio ad by martin ?	then running in illinois for u.s. senate ?	in which martin said he had it on " solid rumor " that his opponent was gay .	martin says he was denied admission to the bar because he helped research details of a scandal that rocked the court .	his history of filing lawsuits ?	some laced with anti-semitic vitriol ?	goes back decades .	in connecticut in 1984 , u.s. district court judge jose cabranes issued an order barring martin from filing any more lawsuits .	the 2nd circuit court of appeals ?	which covers connecticut , vermont and new york ?	upheld the order , calling martin " perhaps the most prolific litigator in this circuit 's history . "	years later , when cabranes was divorcing his first wife , martin filed a motion to be appointed guardian of the couple 's two children .	martin last week dismissed the numerous federal court opinions critical of his vexatious litigation , saying , " if one judge tells a lie , the others like to pig-pile . " "	i 've filed hundreds , if not thousands , of cases , " martin said . "	sometimes you have to be abrasive . "	martin said the balsams lawsuit is " about rich people preying on poor people " and that he is fighting to restore the approximately 300 jobs lost when the hotel , where the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballots have been cast for 50 years , closed in september 2011 .	he claims new hampshire attorney general michael delaney 's review of the sale by a charitable trust established by the hotel 's original owner was cursory and corrupt . "	there 's a new sheriff in town , and this sheriff knows how to follow the bad guys , " martin told the ap .	lawyers for the new owners of the balsams challenged martin 's standing to bring the lawsuit , maintaining he is n't even a new hampshire resident and that his only contact with the hotel was having dinner there one night last year .	martin says he lives in manchester , n.h. , but declined to give an address , saying the people he is dealing with " have a lot at stake . "	in a notice to the judge filed tuesday , martin offered to give tours of his manchester " man cave " to quell " obsession " by the media and opposing counsel about his domicile .	he was vague about his income , saying he makes money from consulting and writing and alluded to family money .	martin eschews the label " gadfly " as being frivolous . "	i 'm a heavy duty litigator , " he said .
federal authorities say a new york city man who recruited people to come to vermont and sell crack-cocaine and heroin has been sentenced to over 18 years in prison as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors .	the u.s. attorney 's office says 40-year-old todd jarvis of the bronx , n.y. , pleaded guilty last fall to conspiring to distribute crack-cocaine .	court records say he ran a large-scale crack and heroin distribution ring in central vermont from 2006 through 2009 .	prosecutors said jarvis found local residents who would allow the bronx distributors to sell the drugs out of their homes ; some have been prosecuted .	prosecutors said jarvis 's girlfriend , waketa coleman , also pleaded guilty to similar charges .	she is scheduled be sentenced on may 22 .
afghan officials confirm that taliban insurgents have taken control of the chardara district in northern kunduz province .	mohammad yusouf ayubi , head of provincial council in kunduz , said on sunday that taliban fighters established control of the district after two days of attacks on local security forces .	sayed sarwar hussaini , spokesman for the provincial police chief , said that reinforcements are being dispatched and an operation to retake the district is imminent .	ayubi said local residents have fled their homes seeking safety .	taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack in an emailed statement and claimed heavy casualties among the afghan security forces .	afghan army and police forces have sustained heavy losses in the field against the taliban following the departure of international combat forces at the end of last year .

top environmental regulators for four republican presidents told congress on wednesday what many republican lawmakers wo n't : action is needed on global warming .	in a congressional hearing organized to undermine republican opposition to president barack obama 's environmental proposals , senate democrats asked the heads of the environmental protection agency for richard nixon , george h.w. bush , george w. bush and ronald reagan to discuss the risks from climate change and what should be done about it .	some republicans dispute the science of climate change and have worked to unravel obama 's steps to address it .	action on capitol hill ?	where even a bland , bipartisan energy efficiency bill could n't get passed in may ?	has been in a deep freeze . "	we have a scientific consensus around this issue .	we also need a political consensus , " said christine todd whitman , the former new jersey governor and first epa administrator under president george w. bush , who resigned her post after disagreeing with the white house 's direction on pollution rules .	whitman was joined by william ruckelshaus , the nation 's first epa administrator under president richard nixon , william reilly , who led the epa under president george h.w. bush , and lee thomas , who was administrator under reagan .	the strategy by democrats was reminiscent of other high-profile hearings on climate change that created fanfare but resulted in little action .	in march , democrats staged an all-nighter on the senate floor to talk climate change .	in 2009 , former vice president al gore and former house speaker newt gingrich sparred before a house committee over climate change .	climate scientist james hansen in 1988 told the senate the planet is warming and pollution is to blame .	the epa chiefs ' testimony apparently did little to bridge the divide .	coal miners packed the hearing to protest a new epa plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from power plants .	before any testimony , top republicans on the senate environmental panel said the rule would kill jobs for no environmental benefit .	that view contrasted sharply with the opinions of the four epa administrators , who said the obama administration had worked hard to make the proposal flexible and workable , using authority provided by congress .	the former epa administrators told lawmakers that global warming was similar to other serious environmental issues they confronted , such as industrial pollution , dangerous pesticides or water contamination .	but tackling those issues enjoyed broad public support . "	inherent in all of these problems was uncertain science and powerful economic interests resisting controls .	the same is true of climate change , " said ruckelshaus , who also led the agency under reagan . "	in all of the cases cited , the solutions to the problems did not result in the predicted economic and social calamity . "	the four epa chiefs also said that they are not alone in the republican party . "	there are republicans that believe the climate is changing and humans have a role to play .	they just need some political cover , " said whitman , in an interview before the hearing .	reilly was even more direct . "	there is a lot happening on climate , " he said , citing efforts by states and corporations to tackle the problem . "	it 's just not happening in washington .

months after it was sold , a south dakota maker of motorcycle trikes is back in business .	terree matson-mccoy , the general manager of lehman trikes , said the spearfish company recently sent a shipment of new machines to distributors in the northeastern united states .	the company is converting six motorcycle models into three-wheeled trikes for harley-davidson , honda , kawasaki and suzuki , she said .	lehman suspended its operations in march because of business problems and a slow economy , the black hills pioneer reported ( http://bit.ly/owyh2h ) .	in june , champion trikes , a company based in garden grove , calif. , said it would be taking over the company and resuming its operations .	matson-mccoy said the industry 's prospects are improving , because older motorcyclists are switching to trikes and more women are taking up riding .	she said she had been eager to resume motorcycle trike production . "	so many people in the industry are excited to have us back , " she said .	craig arrojo , the president of champion trikes , said he expected to have about 50 workers at the reopened plant in spearfish .	he said the earlier suspension was not " because of quality of products .

a swollen des moines river crested friday near a cracked levee that failed two years ago near downtown des moines , and officials cautioned that weekend rains could cause the river to rise again .	the river crested at 26.05 feet , 3 feet above flood stage but less than the 31.6 feet it reached in 2008 when a levee ruptured and allowed flood waters to inundate the city 's small , working-class birdland neighborhood .	officials spotted a crack in the levee thursday night , but the u.s. army corps of engineers said it had stabilized with no sign of further erosion .	no evacuations have been ordered , but storms were forecast to return sunday .	officials will closely watch the levee ?	and the forecast ?	over the weekend , city public works director bill stowe said .	the river is expected to drop to flood stage on monday , but heavy rains could force saylorville lake , the reservoir designed to protect the city from flooding , to release more water into the river . "	if we get substantial rain in the des moines river basin , it could mean the uncontrolled release of water from saylorville could continue through next week , " stowe said .	tom heinold , the army corps ' flood-risk management coordinator , said even if the river rises again it likely wo n't reach the levels it hit friday . "	our best models show that even if we have a 2 to 3 inch rain , the peak that would follow several days after that would not get to the elevation we see now , " heinold said late friday afternoon .	heinold said no changes have been seen in the birdland levee since thursday night . "	it appears to be stable , " he said .	the birdland neighborhood has twice flooded because of the levee 's failure , in 1993 and 2008 .	design plans to rebuild the levee have been completed , but construction has n't started .	the water seeping through the levee friday was flowing into a lagoon .	as the level of the lagoon rises , the pressure on the barrier will increase and slow the release of water through the crack , heinold said .	if the levee fails , a secondary berm built behind it would likely hold , stowe said .	storms are forecast to return to iowa on sunday , and possibly continue through monday and tuesday .	national weather service forecasters said there 's a good chance that large parts of the state could see 2 inches or more of rain .	the most likely result of more rain would be that the river and saylorville lake would return to normal levels less quickly , said jeff zogg , a hydrologist with the weather service .	but the levee failures have occurred after the river crested and was falling , zogg noted .	the longer the water remains in contact with the levee , the more pressure it puts on the levee . "	sometimes the pressure from the water helps to keep it ( the levee ) together .	when the water level goes down , the pressure goes away and the support goes away , " he said .

eight american troops died in attacks in southern afghanistan , including a car bombing and gunfight outside a police compound in kandahar , officials said wednesday as the taliban push back against a coalition effort to secure the volatile region .	a suicide attacker slammed a car bomb into the gate of the headquarters of the elite afghan national civil order police late tuesday in kandahar , a nato statement said .	minutes later , insurgents opened fire with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades .	three u.s. troops , an afghan policeman and five civilians died in the attack , but nato said the insurgents failed to enter the compound .	the special police unit , known as ancop , had only recently been dispatched to kandahar to set up checkpoints along with international forces to try to secure the south 's largest city , the spiritual birthplace of the taliban .	the dead civilians included three afghan translators and two security guards , kandahar provincial police chief sardar mohammad zazai said .	taliban spokesman qari yousef ahmadi telephoned reporters wednesday to claim responsibility for the attack .	the insurgents , which are prone to exaggerate death tolls inflicted on afghan and international security forces , claimed 13 international troops and eight afghan security forces died in the raid .	nato and afghan troops are fanning out elsewhere in kandahar province to pressure insurgents in rural areas .	the strategy is to improve security with more and better-trained police and troops so that capable governance can take root and development projects can move forward and win the loyalty of ordinary afghans .	the taliban have responded by ratcheting suicide attacks and bombings , making last month the deadliest of the nearly 9-year-old war for international forces .	on wednesday , four more american troops were killed by a roadside bomb in the south , while one more u.s. service member died the same day of wounds from a gunbattle .	so far in july , 45 international troops have died in afghanistan , 33 of them americans .	in other attacks around the country , nine afghan civilians died in the south when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in the volatile district of marjah in helmand province , the ministry of interior said .	another homemade bomb killed two security guards traveling on a road in eastern paktika province .	two suspected taliban also died in helmand 's lashkar gar district when the roadside bomb they were trying to plant exploded prematurely , the ministry said .	homemade explosives planted in roads and pathways are a leading killer of international forces and also kill hundreds of civilians each year .

missouri gov. jay nixon believes that an electric cooperative in a rural northeast missouri county could be setting a trend for other rural areas of the nation to follow .	nixon was in new london on thursday to formally launch the ralls county electric cooperative 's fiber internet initiative .	he was joined by jonathan adelstein , administrator of the u.s. department of agriculture 's rural utilities service .	the co-op just south of hannibal is one of the first in the nation , and the first in missouri , to receive federal stimulus funding for the development of broadband internet , which remains lacking in many rural areas .	the quincy herald-whig reports that the co-op has strung 450 miles of fiber cable and is delivering high-speed internet to about 100 homes .	nixon compared the effort to another visible piece of the nation 's infrastructure that also began in missouri . "	just like missouri in 1956 was the centerpiece for the interstate system , the show-me state will be the centerpiece " for broadband , nixon said .	the ralls county co-op is using more than $ 19 million in funding it received in january 2010 .	general manager dan strode hopes to eventually have 1,200 miles of fiber providing super-high-speed internet for 4,500 customers . "	the future of communications is coming to ralls county , " strode said . "	everything looks like this will work for rural america . "	nixon noted the importance of high-speed internet for schoolchildren . "	every classroom in this region will have access to every book ever written and every class taught in the world , " said the democrat , whose administration has made rural broadband access a priority through the mobroadbandnow initiative . "	we are confident that broadband access is a game-changer . "	adelstein said that in addition to education , health care , electric utilities and business will be dramatically enhanced by better and faster internet access .	he compared the impact of widely available broadband to that of universally available electricity through the development of rural electric cooperatives 75 years ago .

when a new hospital opens at fort riley in 2014 , it will be capable of serving the entire active duty community , including family members , as well as retirees , a post official said wednesday .	col. mike heimall , irwin army community hospital commander , set that goal for the facility during a presentation to representatives of area communities . "	the new hospital will be exactly what the installation needs to meet the health needs of the current and future population on post , " heimall said . "	we will be able to provide health care to all active duty soldiers and their families as well as all retired military personnel and their families . "	the $ 404 million dollar project is estimated to be finished in the spring of 2014 and will be about 170,000 square feet larger than irwin army community hospital , said heimall .	it will also employ more people opening up job opportunities in the area health care workforce . "	the hospital staff consists of almost of 1,500 people with just about 400 of those being military personnel , " he said . "	we still need to hire about 400 more new employees to meet the needs of our growing population by fiscal year 2013 . "	it is expected to be finished about a year or so after all five brigades assigned to the base will all be home , putting the base 's population around 16,000 soldiers plus any families that follow them .	soldier 's deployment times will also be changing allowing them to be stationed here for a longer period of time .	staffing increases of the size looming at the post hospital could ripple throughout the area medical community .	but the head of the area 's largest regional hospital said he did not anticipate problems . "	they recruit people nationally to come work at the base , " said john broberg , chief executive officer of mercy regional health center . "	and by working together we are going to try to keep more services localized that will help not only our communities but the patients since they wo n't have to travel as far to get the care they need . "	each year patients receive about $ 108 million worth of services at the irwin hospital with an additional $ 39 million spent off post .	of the additional $ 39 million spent off base about $ 10 million is spend between manhattan and junction city , heimall said . "	all of that money spent off post is mostly for specialists , " he said . "	with the new hospital we are going to try to recruit more specialists so the rest of the $ 39 million will be spent here in the flint hills . "	the biggest specialist needs not just for ft. riley but for the entire region are neurologists and internal medicine doctors .	but since only soldiers and family members of active and retired soldiers have access to the health care provided on post , many people from the surrounding communities are worried that they wo n't see the benefits of the new military hospital . "	what would most likely happen is that if we can recruit these specialists to the area they would set up offices on and off post , " said ty warner , executive director of the flint hills regional council . "	everyone that is coming to the area whether for nbaf or other job opportunities is just as worried about healthcare as everyone out here on base . "	if we can get more specialists to come to the area , along with the public transportation and the economic development that 's going on , would make the flint hills that more of an attractive place to live , " warner said . "	we just need to make sure we capitalize on these opportunities . "	an ap member exchange
gov. sam brownback 's administration already has developed talking points to deflect anticipated criticism of the newly enacted massive income tax cuts should kansas face significant budget problems next year .	critics said their fears about the aggressiveness of the cuts were confirmed by the conservative republican governor 's budget director in july , when he told state agencies to draft proposals for slicing up to 10 percent of their spending .	brownback and his allies argue that the tax cuts will stimulate economic activity , generating new tax revenues to more than offset what the state gives up .	the administration is fashioning a narrative that suggests budget cuts may be necessary because the nation 's economy may remain stagnant .	europe 's financial crisis also looms as a potential threat .

markets clawed back lost ground tuesday on hopes that greece is heading toward a conclusion of debt-reduction talks with private creditors and that it may secure its second bailout package this week .	late monday , following the agreement by a large majority of countries in the european union to sign a new treaty designed to stop overspending in the eurozone , greece 's prime minister lucas papademos indicated that progress was being made . "	it is likely that the market will initially cheer an agreement should it be reached reflecting reduced concerns that greece will default disorderly in march , " said lee hardman , an analyst at bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj .	though greece remains the epicenter of europe 's debt crisis , leaders are pushing ahead with other plans to tie economies together .	the new treaty , commonly known as the fiscal compact , was agreed at a summit .	only britain and the czech republic opted out of the deal that is meant to make it more difficult for countries to run up massive debts , like the ones that are currently roiling the 17-nation eurozone .	the hope among participants is that the tighter rules will restore confidence in their joint currency and convince investors that all of them will get their debts under control .	for now , investors appear to be giving european policymakers the benefit of the doubt especially as there are hopes a second bailout of greece will agreed alongside a debt-reduction deal between the country and its private creditors , possibly as soon as this week .	in europe , the ftse 100 index of leading british shares was up 0.9 percent at 5,719 while germany 's dax rose 1 percent to 6,508 .	the cac-40 in france was 1.2 percent higher at 3,305 .	wall street was poised for a solid opening ?	dow futures and the broader s&p 500 futures were both up 0.5 percent .	the improvement in sentiment was evident in the currency markets too where the euro was up 0.4 percent at $ 1.3193 .	the euro often garners support when investors look to take on more risk .	despite the more optimistic backdrop tuesday , europe 's debt woes remain the main worry in the markets .	a growing fear is that portugal may also need to get private creditors to reduce their debts , even though europe 's leaders say greece 's debt-reduction deal is a one-off .	portugal 's borrowing costs have been rising consistently to record highs over recent days as the economy shows few signs of improving " the market also has portugal in its spotlight as regards the potential default risk , and the portuguese 10-year yield opened just above the 18 percent level this morning , " said neil mackinnon , global macro strategist at vtb capital .	earlier in asia , solid japanese industrial data helped stocks rally .	tokyo 's nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent to 8,802.51 after data showed december industrial activity rose 4 percent over the previous month .	hong kong 's hang seng gained 1.1 percent to 20,383.3 and seoul 's kospi was up 0.8 percent at 1,955.79 .	china 's benchmark shanghai composite index was up 0.3 percent at 2,292.61 ahead of wednesday 's release of a key manufacturing index .	investors are hoping for a loosening of credit curbs if it shows activity is slowing amid lackluster global demand .	oil prices tracked equities higher ?	benchmark oil for march delivery was up 98 cents to $ 99.76 per barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange .	joe mcdonald in beijing contributed to this report .

administration secretary justin johnson said the results -- about 5.3 percent ahead of target -- were primarily due to better than targeted receipts in personal income taxes and corporate income taxes .	johnson said the strong performance helped rebuild the revenue shortfall from august .	the september results have pushed the cumulative year-to-date general fund receipts above the target by $ 4.9 million , or nearly 1.5 percent .	first-quarter revenue receipts for fiscal year 2016 now exceed the prior fiscal year 's results by a little over 4 percent .	transportation fund revenues also exceeded the monthly target by about 9 percent , and education fund receipts were 5 percent ahead .

hundreds of protesters converged on city hall again , as authorities said no video captured what happened to a baltimore man inside a police van where officers heaved him into a metal compartment after pinning him to a sidewalk .	the cause of his fatal spine injury remained unknown .	a troubling detail emerged thursday , however : freddie gray was not only handcuffed and put in leg irons , but left without a seat belt during his trip to the station .	unbelted detainees have been paralyzed and even killed by rough rides in what used to be called " paddy wagons . "	it even has a name : " nickel rides , " referring to cheap amusement park thrills .	gray , who was black , suffered the spine injury under mysterious circumstances after he was handcuffed and put in the van .	the 25-year-old died in a hospital a week after his april 12 arrest and his death became part of the national debate about the deaths of black men at the hands of police .	police brutality against prisoners being transported was addressed just six months ago in a plan released by baltimore officials to reduce this misconduct .	department rules updated nine days before gray 's arrest clearly state that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or " other authorized restraining devices " for their own safety after arrest .	gray was not belted in , said attorney michael davey , who represents at least one of the officers under investigation .	but he took issue with the rules . "	policy is policy , practice is something else , " particularly if a prisoner is combative , davey told the associated press . "	it is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small , and this one was very small . "	commissioner anthony batts said there are no circumstances under which a prisoner should not be wearing a seatbelt during transport . "	he was n't wearing a seatbelt and that 's part of our investigation , " batts told the associated press on thursday .	batts also said another man who was in the van during the tail end of gray 's ride told investigators that gray was " was still moving around , that he was kicking and making noises " up until the van arrived at the station .	but batts was careful to say that the investigation includes " everything the officers did that day . "	meanwhile , protesters marching in support of gray briefly scuffled with police , shouting at them and throwing objects .	police said on their twitter feed that at least two people were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and destruction of property .	the protesters also surrounded a police transport van , similar to the one gray was put in after he was arrested .	police formed a barrier around the van and it was able to leave the area .	the march carried on .	the protest has lasted for a couple of hours , shutting down rush hour traffic .	protesters have grown increasingly agitated .
patrick redig talks about midwest peregrine falcons like they 're his children .	his passion for the falcons began in adolescence , so it saddened him when he learned they were on the verge of extinction . "	not only could i not conceive of the peregrine coming back , i had no conception that i would be involved , " said redig , the university of minnesota raptor center founder and director emeritus .	the midwest peregrine falcon nearly went extinct in the early 1960s , but the contributions of university professors over the past few decades helped restore the population through both natural and urban nesting sites , the minnesota daily reported ( http://bit.ly/xpmkuj ) .	beginning in 1982 , redig and the late harrison " bud " tordoff , former bell museum of natural history director , collaborated to breed the falcons in captivity and release them .	now , the peregrine population has surpassed the number of falcons that existed before they became endangered . "	no matter how you look at it , the peregrine falcon is just one of the most amazing creatures on the face of the earth , " redig said peregrine falcons are lightweight , bird-eating raptors that can reach speeds of more than 200 mph when diving in the air for prey , said amber burnette , a raptor center program associate .	they nest on high cliffs and tall buildings , including sites in downtown minneapolis and st. paul , as well as on campus , burnette said .	the widespread use of pesticides like ddt , which was banned in 1972 , nearly wiped out the entire peregrine population in north america ?	east of the rocky mountains and south of the arctic by the early 1960s ?	redig said .	in the 1970s , a group of falconers and professors from cornell university established the peregrine fund to crossbreed subspecies of peregrines , but redig said they lacked the resources to be successful .	in 1982 , redig and tordoff took matters into their own hands .	they bred the falcons in captivity and released them along the mississippi river , but great horned owls killed all of the peregrines .	after three years without success , redig said they decided to release the falcons from tall buildings in cities . "	that was just an absolute watershed event , " redig said . "	it turns out peregrines love buildings . "	the falcons began claiming the buildings as their nesting sites , prompting redig and tordoff to build sites for them in minneapolis locations and eventually expand throughout the midwest .	about 40 pairs of peregrines lived in the midwest before being wiped out by ddt .	the goal of the restoration work was to breed a population about half that size .	in 2011 , there were more than 300 pairs in the midwest , according to the midwest peregrine society .	they were taken off the u.s. endangered species list in 1999 . "	we 're probably at carrying capacity right now , " redig said .	redig has created and maintained a database of the falcons , accumulating 6,635 total branded peregrines in the midwest since the project began .	he said tracking the peregrines has resulted in information about falcon patterns , longevity , productivity , survival of young and which falcons are genetically fit .	the project redig and tordoff began now has hundreds of people involved , said jackie fallon , vice president of field operations for the midwest peregrine society .	fallon , who became involved in the late 1980s , maintains about 45 nesting sites throughout minnesota and wisconsin . "	there 's just been so many different people that have been involved and excited to have the peregrines back , " fallon said .	breeding and releasing falcons , known as hacking , can be expensive , redig said .	hacking falcons costs about $ 2,500 per bird .	over the years , it has totaled more than $ 3.2 million to hack 1,286 falcons .	most of the money came from private donations , which resulted from tordoff 's fundraising .	tordoff also did field work with banding falcons and maintaining nesting grounds , redig said . "	i would say he was the heart and soul of the whole thing , " redig said . "	he made a lot of stuff happen . "	fallon said tordoff spent thousands of hours in the field and watched birds into his early 80s .	he died in 2008 at age 85 . "	( tordoff ) was a huge mentor to me , " she said .	the success of redig 's and tordoff 's work led others to consider if it could be replicated for other species , said robert zink , a bell museum breckenridge chair in ornithology .	zink said the peregrine was a rare case because it prefers urban landscapes , which is a rarity among endangered species . "	it 's not clear whether this provides a model for other species that are n't so human-adaptable as the peregrines are , " zink said .	but redig said the story of the peregrine 's recovery might distort the complexity of endangered species restoration because the problem , ddt , was already eliminated .	other repopulation attempts have n't been as successful .	redig said lead poisoning from leftover hunting ammunition is still largely responsible for endangering the california condor .	redig has worked on trying to restore their population as well .	until hunting big game with lead-based ammunition is more regulated , redig said , the condor can not become a self-sustaining population .	ultimately , redig said the survival of an endangered species relies on the community at large . "	people create the problem and people can fix the problem , " redig said . "	but they got to decide that they want to fix it first . "
students in a shuttered michigan school district that could n't pay its teachers could soon be back in the classroom after the state agreed wednesday to provide funding for the rest of the school year .	the michigan department of education said in a statement that state superintendent mike flanagan has approved the buena vista school district 's deficit elimination plan and is urging the school to reopen its doors as soon as possible .	the district 's roughly 400 students have n't been in their classrooms since may 3 . "	we are ecstatic that our students will be able to return to school and that staff members will be able to return to their jobs , " buena vista superintendent deborah hunter-harvill told the associated press . "	i think it makes us a stronger community that we have been able to get through this process . "	hunter-harvill said the district is aiming to get students back in school as early as friday .	but she said getting the schools up and running again will hinge on discussions with the local teachers ' union .	the district 's board of education is expected to meet thursday night to discuss the details .	the schools laid off all 27 of its teachers and all but three other employees on may 7 , and announced it would n't be able to make payroll on may 24 .	sharp drops in enrollment contributed to the district going into debt in 2011 , with its deficit reaching $ 1 million last july .	under michigan law , the state has to withhold aid when a school district has a deficit ?	unless the district has an approved plan for getting out of debt .	buena vista 's plan is largely dependent on staffing cuts , and if the district can not get out of debt , other board-approved cuts will have to be made , according to a letter from the state .	additional details about the plan were n't disclosed .	joe ann nash , president of the buena vista education association , the teachers ' union , said she is looking forward to having all the students and teachers back in the classroom .	the state put a freeze on the district 's aid because it could n't come up with a deficit elimination plan that actually helped to pull the district out of its debt .	but the district 's board of education approved a plan tuesday night that the state was able to sign off on .	the state also has been withholding money since april to recoup about $ 580,000 for a juvenile detention education program that the district no longer operates .	the state had planned to keep recouping that money through part of july , but it said wednesday that it would now manage the use of the funds to ensure that buena vista can make payroll for the rest of the year .	u.s. rep. dan kildee of flint , who represents the district where the buena vista schools are located and has repeatedly called on the state to reopen the schools , said he was pleased about wednesday 's decision to release the funds . "	this is certainly a promising development and it is my hope that the kids and teachers will immediately return to their classrooms and finish their school year , " he said in a statement .	earlier this week , the state and the school district developed a " backup plan " in case the school had to remain closed for the rest of the year .	under that plan , the district would have run a " skills camp " using federal dollars to teach the students math , reading and writing .	buena vista students will be able to receive free school breakfast and lunch at the school until regular classes resume .	since tuesday , the saginaw school district director has been providing breakfast and lunch at buena vista high school .

an elementary-school substitute teacher , a children 's shoe store worker and two dozen others were part of a perverse underground that swapped graphic photos and videos of children being sexually abused , the manhattan district attorney said tuesday .	the 26 arrests announced tuesday marked an unusually sweeping case of its kind for a local prosecutor , said parry aftab , the founder of wiredsafety , an organization that advises people on using the internet safely .	the men , ranging from a banker to a bartender and a corporate lawyer to community college students , " traded images of child sexual assault the way that others trade baseball cards , " district attorney cyrus r. vance jr. said .	using an online file-sharing system authorities declined to identify , the men collected and traded " truly sickening " images of boys and girls , some apparently as young as a year old , being forced into sex acts , vance said .	authorities said they found tens of thousands of images during a five-month investigation that included federal and even canadian authorities .	the substitute teacher , joshua ruiz , had explicit photos and videos and chatted online with other people about engaging children in sexual activities , telling one he had had sexual contact with a relative under 15 , prosecutors told a judge tuesday .	when another online correspondent discussed the idea of a sexual encounter with a small girl , ruiz said he " would love to be a part of it if you let me , at least just to watch , " prosecutors said .	ruiz , 32 , pleaded not guilty tuesday to promoting and possessing a sexual performance by a child .	his lawyer did n't immediately return a call afterward .	the city department of education said ruiz had no criminal record when hired in september 2008 .	after filling in at a number of schools , most recently on manhattan 's west side , he was removed from teaching after his arrest last month , the department said .	ruiz also works as a piano teacher , prosecutors said .	he is free on $ 15,000 bail .	glen barfield , an architect , chatted and exchanged explicit images online with a 16-year-old boy in canada , ultimately getting the boy to perform a sex act while he watched via webcam , prosecutors said .	they said they and canadian authorities had found the boy and notified his family .	barfield , 39 , has pleaded not guilty .	he and his lawyer declined to comment tuesday .	corporate lawyer moshe gerstein had about 5,000 images of child sexual assault in his home computers , prosecutors said ; gerstein , 35 , has yet to enter a plea .	he and his lawyer did n't immediately return phone and e-mail messages tuesday .	miguel caraballo , a dishwasher at a child-themed restaurant , kept his collection sorted by the children 's ages , with some folders for children as young as 1 , prosecutors said .	caraballo , 29 , has pleaded not guilty ; his lawyer did n't immediately return a phone message . "	these are not just people who accidentally found this material " or clicked on a link to it by mistake , assistant district attorney david szuchman said .	the men range in age from 18 to 63 ; some have children of their own , prosecutors said .	they include deli and drug store workers , a security guard and a building superintendent , a high-school student and others .	the charges against them vary , but they generally face charges of promoting or possessing a child sexual performance , which can carry up to seven years in prison .	under the relevant new york laws , " sexual performance " refers to any visual representation that includes sexual conduct ?	actual or simulated ?	by a child under 17 . "	promote " does n't necessarily mean to publicize or advertise ; it can also mean to circulate , provide or acquire .

the first boeing 787 landed wednesday in tokyo where launch customer all nippon airways will prepare the long-delayed aircraft for its inaugural commercial flight .	the plane took off from everett , wash. , tuesday morning to cheering workers after a three-year delay in bringing the new wide-body jetliner to market .	chicago-based boeing missed the initial may 2008 delivery target and had repeatedly delayed its introduction because of problems in development .	the plane goes into service on oct. 26 with a special charter flight from narita international airport to hong kong .	ana will begin using the 787 on regular domestic routes on nov. 1 .	the new jet is the first commercial airliner built using carbon fiber ?	a strong , lightweight , high-tech plastic ?	rather than the typical aluminum skin .	it is quieter and uses about 20 percent less fuel than a comparably sized aluminum aircraft .	airlines have ordered more than 800 of the planes that will compete with the airbus a350 .	ana , the world 's eighth-largest airline by revenue , considers the 787 an important part of its global expansion efforts .	because of its extended range , ana plans to use it on a number of new long-haul routes that were not commercially viable because passenger numbers were n't sufficient to justify larger aircraft such as the boeing 747 .	the 787 cabin will have bigger windows and larger overhead compartments .	ana also says passengers will be more comfortable because air pressure during flights will be equivalent to an altitude of 6,000 feet instead of the conventional 8,000 feet .

once stored away in boxes with no sign of daylight , iowa state university 's old marching band uniforms are seeing new life this semester .	after being retired in 2010 when isu changed its official logo , nearly 1,000 polyester wool-blend uniforms are now being reincarnated as tote bags and laptop cases .

revel is going in reverse .	atlantic city 's newest casino took less money from gamblers in september than it did in august .	the 6-month-old casino resort won $ 16.8 million last month , down from $ 20 million in august .	atlantic city 's 12 casinos collectively saw their september revenue fall by 6.3 percent to $ 276 million compared with september 2011 .	so far , revel has not been the catalyst that many in atlantic city had hoped it would be .	the gambling market has been shrinking here since 2007 .	revel ceo kevin desanctis said the revenue decline was due to an unlucky month at table games ; slots were basically flat compared with august .	the table losses were not due to a handful of high-rollers hitting it big , but rather by a large number of players doing well , he said . "	it seems like everybody that came into revel and played went away happy , " he said . "	some months you 're just going to hold more than others . "	since it opened in april , revel has ranked 8th out of atlantic city 's 12 casinos in terms of revenue , a ranking it retained in september .	in april , it won $ 13.4 million , followed by $ 13.9 million in may , $ 14.9 million in june , and $ 17.5 million in july .	desanctis said revel continues to do well with its leisure and group stay customers , which he said are just as important to its bottom line as gambling customers are .	but he said the casino needs to do better at slots and table games . "	we clearly have some things we need to improve , " he said . "	we have to get much better in gaining market share .	we 're just not doing it yet . "	collectively , atlantic city 's 12 casinos won $ 198.4 million at slots last month , down 3.2 percent from a year ago , and $ 77.6 million at table games , down 13.6 percent .	only one casino , the golden nugget atlantic city , posted a revenue increase .	it was up 7.7 percent in september to $ 11.5 million .	the tropicana casino and resort saw the biggest year-over-year monthly decline , 29 percent , to $ 21.5 million .	bally 's atlantic city was down 22.6 percent to $ 24.5 million .	trump plaza hotel and casino was down 18.8 percent to $ 8.9 million , the lowest total of any atlantic city casino .	its parent company , trump entertainment resorts , has been shopping trump plaza to potential buyers for more than a year without success .	the showboat casino hotel was down 15.3 percent to $ 19.4 million ; harrah 's resort atlantic city was down 12.9 percent to $ 32.7 million ; and the trump taj mahal casino resort was down 8.3 percent to $ 27.9 million .	caesars atlantic city was down 7.2 percent to $ 33.3 million ; the borgata hotel casino & spa was down 5.9 percent to $ 55.3 million , which was still by far the highest total in the city ; and the atlantic club casino hotel was down 1.9 percent to $ 11.8 million .	for the first nine months of the year , casinos won $ 2.4 billion , down 4.8 percent from the same period in 2011 .	the city 's convention and visitors authority reported that the number of occupied hotel room nights over the summer increased by 11 percent compared with summer 2011 .	the increase was due in large part to the additional 1,400 rooms revel brought to the market this year and the closure of the casino hotels for three nights in august 2011 due to hurricane irene .

"	you make something like this and the really fun part is bringing it to a place and watching the kids come by and looking at the thing and seeing their eyes light up . "	like many people , hall picked up the hobby as a child .	however , girls and baseball came along and the miniature tracks and cars were placed in boxes and stuffed under the bed or in a closet .	he did n't pick it up again until about 1972 during a military deployment in germany .	the model railroad hobby is perfect for the lone wolf who retires to the garage for hours , or for the social enthusiast who enjoys collaboration .	in other words , hall said , it has something for everyone . "	it 's an escape , " hall said . "	therapy , " said another club member .	along with the full train displays , the 20th annual wiregrass model railroad show boasted more than 130 product tables with vendors as far away as texas coming to sell all things related to the hobby .	more than a thousand people were expected to come through the doors , and it is believed to be the largest model railroad show south of atlanta .	the show resumes sunday .	the wiregrass steel wheels division of the national model railroad association , a nonprofit group , uses the show 's proceeds to support various chapter projects in the wiregrass area .

police have taken several steps in their fight against prescription pill abuse in kentucky over the last decade , but now they are facing new challenges .	the state has more treatment facilities than it did when the issue came to the forefront 10 years ago after several high-profile arrests in eastern kentucky , but it does n't offer enough for all the people who need them , the lexington herald-leader reports .	another addition to the fight is operation unite , which was set up in 2003 by republican u.s. rep. harold rogers to fight drugs in his southeastern kentucky district .	while the federal task force has made several arrests in that region , local police say they are seeing more prescription pill activity in central kentucky .	lexington police chief ronnie bastin says officers there have begun to seize more prescription pills . "	the game has changed , " bastin said .	police said a suspect charged in january with a triple slaying in lexington had been to florida to get pills with the victims .	in nearby boyle county , sheriff marty elliott said police are investigating a man suspected of importing prescription pills from other states and describes the problem as worse than a decade ago . "	prescription pills are destroying a lot of lives , " he said .	it was around 2001 that prescription opioid abuse surpassed heroin and cocaine use in kentucky and the state still ranks near the top nationally in the rate of abuse .	shawn clusky , a former pill abuser who now helps others kick their additions in pike county , said he believes treatment and education are the keys to overcoming the drug problem . "	people used to use oxycontin , and now they 're using roxicet , and next they 'll be using opana that 's starting to come out , " said clusky . "	you need to focus on treating the people who are addicted now and educating the people who are n't addicted . "	clusky said he was among the first wave of people to get hooked on oxycontin in the late 1990s in eastern kentucky .	he stayed hooked on drugs until he was arrested in 2006 at the age of 25 for selling pills .	he received probation , but then failed a drug test and was sent to westcare rehabilitation center in pike county .	he credits the center with getting him drug free and now works there mentoring others .	the center , which opened in 2005 , has graduated between 500 and 600 men and has grown from 35 beds to 88 .	drug courts , which have grown over the last decade and give people a chance to stay out of jail if they stay clean , has also helped in the fight against prescription pill abuse , police say . "	there 's just so many success stories we never had " a decade ago , smoot said .	even so , the amount the state spends for substance-abuse treatment from its general fund is declining amid budget woes and the rate of overdose-related deaths is increasing , according to statistics released by the state cabinet for health and family services .	federal drug czar gil kerlikowske , who visited the state last month to highlight the nation 's problem with prescription drugs , promoted measures such as education and use of prescription-monitoring programs to fight abuse , but he said treatment is also key .	meanwhile , churches and other non-profit groups are adding recovery programs , and the kentucky housing corp. started recovery kentucky , which now has more than 1,700 beds at 14 centers around the state ?	half reserved for people on probation or coming out of prison .	although the centers are n't licensed as treatment providers , they operate with a 12-step program and mentoring for substance abusers .	lawmakers approved a measure this year intended in part to reduce the state 's prison population and use some of the savings for drug treatment .	however , it would take doubling or tripling of the current funding to meet the state 's needs , said robert walker , a university of kentucky associate professor and researcher at uk 's center on drug and alcohol research . "	i think the scope of the problem has just gotten so huge that any of our resources for dealing with it are pretty darn limited , " walker said .

former gov. dolph briscoe jr. , who presided over texas during the oil and gas boom years before a stunning upset in 1978 , died sunday , according to his family .	he was 87 .	briscoe had been hospitalized in poor health in january and had returned home only recently , family spokeswoman ann arnold said .	a rancher and a banker , the two-term democratic governor first elected in 1972 often was praised by friends and supporters for his personal integrity .	during his six years as governor , texas enjoyed increasing oil and gas revenues , and briscoe kept his campaign pledge of no new taxes . "	the necessity of fiscal responsibility in all levels of government is second only to world peace in our survival , " he once said .	briscoe lost to attorney general john hill in the democratic primary in 1978 .	hill lost in the general election to bill clements , texas ' first republican governor since reconstruction .	as briscoe departed , he recommended state taxpayers get a $ 1 billion refund from the $ 2.8 billion " surplus " at the end of his administration , but the refund never materialized .	years after the bitterness of the 1978 political campaign wore off , the conservative democrat still contended he could have defeated clements .	he claimed his conservative supporters were apathetic in his democratic race with hill , whom he 'd tried to paint as an ultraliberal .	briscoe considered a comeback race for governor in 1982 , but instead supported attorney general mark white , the democrat who went on to defeat clements .	after serving as governor , briscoe turned his attention to his ranch and business operations in south texas ?	where he 'd inherited the ranching business from his father , dolph briscoe sr. ?	but always remained on the political scene .	not surprising for a man whose great-great grandfather on his mother 's side , also named briscoe , had signed the texas declaration of independence . "	things get dull at times , " briscoe once said . "	i miss it .	sometimes you miss it like you miss somebody hitting you over the head with a hammer , but you still miss it . "	briscoe hosted hillary rodham clinton in 1996 when she made a campaign trip to uvalde to pick up briscoe 's endorsement for her husband , president bill clinton , a week before the texas primary .	briscoe and the then-first lady drew parallels with the 1948 visit of bess and harry truman , who came calling on former vice president john nance garner in uvalde .	briscoe also attended campaign events for republican gov. george w. bush before he was elected president in 2000 .	from the time he was valedictorian of the uvalde high school graduating class in 1939 , briscoe was accustomed to being top man .	he was elected to the texas house from uvalde in 1949 and served as a legislator for eight years , bragging that he never had an opponent .	after leaving the legislature , briscoe was designated the state 's outstanding conservation rancher , one of the state 's five outstanding young texans by the junior chamber of commerce and mr. south texas .	he served as president of the texas and southwestern cattle raisers association , the south texas chamber of commerce and the texas chamber of commerce .	he also was senior chairman of the board of directors of first state bank of uvalde .	in 2008 , the university of texas at austin named its center for american history for briscoe , who donated $ 15 million to the center .	briscoe 's first bid for the governorship was an unsuccessful one in 1968 , when preston smith won over nine other democrats .	briscoe announced for the 1972 democratic race , immediately hammered opponent lt. gov. ben barnes for being the presiding senate officer when the chamber passed two bills involved in the sharpstown stock fraud scandal , which involved loans allegedly to be made by the sharpstown state bank in houston to top texas democrats in return for favorable banking legislation .	those recipients were to buy stock , then redeem the shares at inflated prices .	barnes never faced charges but his career was tarnished by the scandal .	briscoe easily led the party primary voting , with frances " sissy " farenthold second and barnes a distant third .	briscoe defeated farenthold in a hotly contested runoff and nosed out republican hank grover by less than 100,000 votes in november .	briscoe won re-election in 1974 , carrying 247 of 254 counties .	he became the state 's first four-year chief officer because of a 1975 law changing the governor 's term length .	throughout his public career , briscoe refused to reveal his full wealth , filing reports showing only what public officials were required to disclose .	but several published accounts cited him as the state 's largest landholder , with more than 1 million acres owned or leased .	the same reports estimated his worth at more than $ 50 million .	briscoe and his wife , janey , were the 1999 recipients of the john henry faulk award for civic virtue presented by the freedom of information foundation of texas .	janey briscoe died of heart problems at age 76 in october 2000 .	dolph briscoe 's survivors include a son , dolph briscoe iii ; two daughters , janey briscoe marmion and cele briscoe carpenter ; and five grandchildren .	funeral arrangements were pending .
south carolina 's electric cooperatives are donating $ 60,000 to send more than 100 aging veterans to washington to see the monument to their service in world war ii .	the 20 cooperatives planned to announce friday they were paying the entire bill for the 12th flight set up by the organization honor flights south carolina , founded by columbia restaurant owner bill dukes .	the announcement was set for friday afternoon , at a celebration held by the cooperatives for their employees in columbia . "	we are funding the whole thing , " said cooperative spokesman van o'cain . "	we have room for about 100 to 110 veterans , depending on the number of wheelchairs involved . "	o'cain said the gift from the cooperatives also pays for the normal $ 500-per-person fee donated by those who volunteer their day to escort the elderly veterans , who often need assistance getting on and off the flight and the buses that take them on the daylong tour of memorials in the district of columbia . "	our goal is that everyone on board the flight will be able to make it at no cost , " o'cain said .	the cooperatives , which serve about 1.5 million people from 46 counties in the state , are looking in particular for veterans from rural areas who may not have been able to take past flights .	the april flight originates in columbia .	others have flown from the greenville-spartanburg area , myrtle beach and charleston .	dukes said the gift will allow for one flight in april and another may 23 .	the veterans see the memorial dedicated to their service in world war ii as well as the korean , vietnam and iwo jima memorials .	their tour also includes a stop at arlington cemetery and the tomb of the unknowns .	volunteers appear at both departing and arriving airports , cheering the veterans and waving flags and banners to give them patriotic greetings they might not have received during their years of service , dukes said .	honor flight of south carolina and its sister organizations have flown about 2,000 veterans to the nation 's capital since the first flight in november 2008 , dukes said .	the trips were inspired by dukes ' own visit to the monuments with his father , a world war ii veteran .	south carolina 's office of veterans ' affairs reports there are about 413,000 military veterans in south carolina , and officials estimate about 35,000 of those served during world war ii .	the dukes father-son visit in 2008 to the national world war ii memorial was a time of remembrance and reflection for both , said the columbia businessman .	the younger dukes served in the air force for four years in the 1960s .	dukes said the eagerness to travel and the capabilities of the aged veterans manages to surprise the veterans ' children . "	for some of these veterans , it is the first time they have ever been on an airplane , " dukes said .	physicians and nurse escorts go over each veteran 's medical records ahead of time to ensure they will be able to handle the excursion , and to find out what medications or assistance they might need , such as oxygen tanks .	airport officials work in advance with the group to make sure all security issues are dealt with ahead of time , and the transportation at the airport is arranged in advance .	veterans and their families will be able to register for the flights at a special website set up by the electric cooperative association , o'cain said .

the debate at franklin and marshall college also revealed that all four candidates support either a moratorium on or an end to the death penalty .	wolf , state treasurer rob mccord and former state environmental protection secretary katie mcginty agreed a moratorium on the death penalty was in order while studying its value , and u.s. rep. allyson schwartz said she opposed it .	their reasons included that it 's imposed with bias against the poor and minorities , it 's costly , it 's questionable as a crime deterrent and it 's occasionally imposed against innocent people .	schwartz said she would be " willing to sign a piece of legislation that would end the death penalty in pennsylvania . "	the man they 're vying to challenge in the fall election , republican gov. tom corbett , was the target of the most of the attacks , especially for his opposition to a tax on the natural-gas industry and an expansion of medicaid and his support for 2011 's budget-balancing cuts in education aid .	wolf , however , was n't far behind in being targeted , and he acknowledged that being the front-runner had put a bull 's - eye on his back .	questions at the debate were posed by journalists and included ones on ethics and leadership style .	the event featured a particularly sharp exchange when wolf , who runs a building materials distribution business in york , responded to assertions by schwartz , saying , " there 's a lot of nonsense there . "	schwartz had questioned wolf 's financial support for the legal fund of a jailed former lawmaker who 's a friend and derided his refusal to take a salary or perks when he served as the secretary of revenue under then-gov .	ed rendell . "	i 'm not sure this style actually is what we 're looking for , " wolf told her . "	this is the same style of negative attack politics that actually gets you to the point where we have the dysfunction we disparage in washington and harrisburg . "	schwartz was asked to defend her attacks on wolf , in the context of her ability to be a leader in harrisburg .	she responded that holding people in government to a higher standard is n't an obstacle to cooperation .	wolf suggested that , as a successful businessman , he 's different from the others .	schwartz , mccord and mcginty stressed their experience in working in government , perhaps in an effort to contrast themselves with wolf 's more limited experience in government .	mcginty pointed to her efforts as rendell 's environmental protection secretary in winning approval from a republican-controlled legislature in 2004 to make pennsylvania the first industrial state to enact renewable-energy standards .	as a result , pennsylvania became the no. 1 state in jobs in wind turbine manufacturing , she said .	mccord , perhaps suggesting wolf is too naive or inexperienced , said getting important work done in government involves toughness and a willingness to respect other points of view . "	i will highlight , though , that that is not the same as saying , ' let 's send mr. rogers to washington ' and everybody will just say , ' well , i 'm a nice guy so everything will work perfectly , ' " mccord said .	corbett is unopposed in the may 20 primary .

federal environmental officials said wednesday they have ordered a tire recycling facility on tribal land in riverside county to stop receiving additional waste and to get rid of stacks of tires and flammable materials that pose a serious fire risk .	the u.s. environmental protection agency issued the order tuesday against consolidated tire recyclers inc. , which operates on land owned by the cabazon band of mission indians in mecca , an agricultural community about 150 miles southeast of los angeles , near the northern tip of the salton sea .	a phone number for consolidated tire recyclers could not be located .	the order is similar to one the epa issued last month against western environmental inc. , a soil recycling facility also located on cabazon land in mecca .	that order , which required western environmental to temporarily stop accepting truckloads of contaminated soil , effectively shut the facility down while local , state , tribal and federal officials deal with a stench traced to its property .	u.s. sen. barbara boxer was set to visit mecca on thursday to discuss environmental pollution and the cleanup that 's under way at the soil recycling plant .	in a statement wednesday , she said she supported the epa 's decision to order the removal of the flammable materials .	the epa took the action against consolidated tire after an inspection early last month found 90,000 stacked tires that were an immediate fire risk .	the visit was a follow-up to an epa inspection last fall that found problems at the site , said amy miller , manager of the agency 's resource conservation and recovery act enforcement office .	a week after the may follow-up inspection , a fire erupted at consolidated tire but was contained .	the tribe has also issued an environmental order against consolidated , miller said .	the epa 's order requires the company to stop receiving waste tires , to reduce the size of its current piles of tires , to remove flammable materials from the tire pile area and to upgrade the fire suppression system .	if it does n't comply , the company could face fines of up to $ 7,500 a day .	consolidated recycles giant tires and turns them into crumb rubber that 's used to fuel a power generation plant .	miller said the action against consolidated was unrelated to the investigation into the stench emanating from western environmental .	workers there were to have completed covering up 40-foot-tall piles of contaminated soil by wednesday and are developing a long-term plan to identify the source of the " rotten egg " smell there and eliminate the odor , miller said .	a third business , a facility that takes green waste and turns it into energy , is also operating on cabazon lands , but there have been no reported problems with that company , miller said .
one of the scariest parts of bypass surgery ?	having your heart stopped and going on a heart-lung machine while doctors fix your clogged arteries ?	is safe even in the elderly and does n't cause mental decline as many people have feared , two landmark studies show .	bypass surgery is one of the most common operations in the world .	there is great debate about the best way to do it , and patients often are given a choice .	usually doctors stop the heart to make it easier to connect new blood vessels to make detours around blocked ones .	but some patients later complain of " pumphead " ?	mental decline thought to be from the heart-lung machines used to pump their blood while their hearts could not .	so surgeons started doing " off-pump " bypasses on beating hearts .	nearly one quarter of bypasses are done this way now .	but that brought a new complaint : results on the blood vessels seemed not as good .	the new studies were aimed at testing all these factors in a rigorous way to see which method was best .	dr. andre lamy of canada 's mcmaster university led a study of 4,752 people in 19 countries .	they were randomly assigned to have bypasses with or without the use of heart pumps .	after one year , there were no big differences in the rates of death , heart attack , stroke or kidney failure in the two groups .	slightly more people who had bypasses without a heart-lung machine needed a follow-up procedure to open clogged arteries but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone .	mental sharpness and quality of life also was similar in the two groups .	that suggests that whatever decline occurred was temporary or a result of anesthesia or something other than the way the operations were done , said dr. timothy gardner , a surgeon and an american heart association spokesman . "	i 'm actually somewhat surprised " the methods proved equally good because the operation is so much harder to do on beating hearts , he said . "	it seems pretty conclusive " that either way is fine .	that was true even in people 75 or older , a group most worried about going on a heart-lung machine .	the second study tested the two bypass methods in 2,539 of these elderly patients in germany .	again , the methods proved equally safe and effective a year later .	the studies were discussed monday at an american college of cardiology conference in san francisco and published online by the new england journal of medicine .

it 's 10 minutes till 7 on a tuesday morning , and the employees of greenberry fabrication are getting ready for work .	but before they fire up their welding torches or start cutting sheet metal , they have to do their warm-up exercises .	with no prompting required , four dozen beefy dudes in orange vests and safety glasses launch into a five-minute stretching routine that would not look out of place in a ballet studio .	they hold each pose for about 30 seconds before moving on to the next , systematically working the kinks out of shoulders , legs and backs . "	we call it our stretch and flex , " explains larry hyland , the company 's site safety manager , as the workers go through their morning ritual at greenberry 's lewisburg shops . "	we 've got a series of stretches we got from various occupational medicine groups , just to help limber 'em up . "	does it really help prevent injuries ?	hyland is convinced . "	i firmly believe it reduces the number of small strains and sprains people incur during their work , " he said . "	i just do n't get reports of a lot of minor aches or ' i tweaked my back . '	i just do n't hear about those . "	greenberry fabrication is a division of greenberry industrial , a full-line industrial general contracting firm that was founded in corvallis in 1974 and is now based in vancouver , wash. .	the daily stretching sessions are a key part of a companywide safety program that recently earned greenberry industrial a national award from the associated general contractors of america .	the morning flex and stretch is followed by a " tailgate meeting " to go over potential safety issues associated with the day 's tasks .	comments and questions are encouraged from everyone on the crew .	workers also get a trifold job-safety analysis checklist that 's supposed to be filled out each day .	it 's known as a radar card , with the acronym spelled out on the front : ?	recognize the risk . ?	assess the situation . ?	develop a plan . ?	act safely . ?	report on progress .	there 's a three-step procedure for identifying each task associated with the job , any potential hazards and safe work practices for addressing those issues .	every friday , greenberry managers hold a companywide conference call to discuss safety issues .	all the top brass sits in , including ceo jason pond .	he also takes part in the ongoing safety trainings his employees get . "	it 's top-down , " said greg goracke , president of greenberry 's construction division . "	it 's a proactive culture , not a reactive culture . "	the comprehensive focus on safety is a big selling point in the industrial construction and fabrication business , where a contractor 's track record can affect worker 's compensation insurance rates on large-scale projects , goracke said .	it also helps build employee loyalty in a trade where on-the-job accidents can have devastating consequences .	goracke said pond and other top managers are constantly reminding their employees to look out for themselves and their co-workers . "	everybody 's got someone to go home to at night , " he noted .	the preoccupation with safety permeates every aspect of greenberry 's operations .	want proof ?	check out the parking lot at the lewisburg shops , where employee vehicles ?	every single one of them ?	are backed into their slots because that reduces the chances of a fender-bender when pulling out .	and the payoff is more than just awards .	the company has logged more than 4 million work hours without a lost-time accident .	at the lewisburg location , that translates into more than 3,250 injury-free days , a fact that is flashed in red led bulbs on a reader board mounted on the side of building . "	i would n't call it a competition , but it is a point of pride , " goracke said of the company 's safety record . "	it 's become a culture now .	i think that 's the whole thing . "
gov.-elect asa hutchinson wants to hire arkansas ' next economic development director in the same way that many state colleges lure their football and basketball coaches : by finding a way around government salary caps in an attempt to attract the best in the business .	hutchinson on monday announced a national search for a candidate who can attract global businesses to arkansas .	he said the person hired should make around $ 200,000 ?	around 40 percent more what is currently paid . "	we have received some inquiries nationally but it did n't take long to recognize that we 're not going to be competitive where we are now to attract the type of candidate that we need , " hutchinson said at a news conference .	hutchinson announced last month he would not retain grant tennille , a gov. mike beebe appointee who makes $ 139,706.11 per year .	he would n't criticize tennille 's work but instead listed what he 'd like to see next : someone with experience putting together packages to attract industry and an understanding of how global firms choose sites between states .	one criticism of arkansas has been its lack of an already trained workforce , including a percentage of college graduates that 's among the lowest in the nation .	to address that issue , the new administration also named a director of workforce services ?	daryl bassett ?	while announcing that a new deputy economic development director ?	danny games ?	would aid in the search for his boss . "	a lot of people talk about this : that arkansas does n't necessarily have the skilled workforce to bring some of these companies in , " hutchinson spokesman j.r. davis said . "	so you have to work on getting those workers the skills they need to take on some of these jobs . "	hutchinson said the money arkansas pays its economic development director pales compared to those in alabama , florida and texas and that legislators must find a way to boost salaries , even if laws must be changed . "	i 've spoken to both the legislative leaders ... about the need to amend the law to allow the arkansas economic development foundation to provide a salary supplement to the currently taxpayer-designated salary , " hutchinson said .	it 's a method currently used to hire coaches for teams at the state 's major schools .	at the university of arkansas , for instance , football coach bret bielema and basketball coach mike anderson are restricted to state salaries of $ 178,695 .	but private funds push their compensation over $ 3 million and $ 2 million , respectively . "	i suspect it would need to get in the $ 200,000 range " for an economic development director , said the governor-elect , who takes office jan. 13 .	hutchinson said he has not targeted anyone for the job , saying it was wide open .	his spokesman said raiding another state , however , would be a possibility . "	i do n't think it 's off-limits , " davis said .

a suspected drunken driver fleeing police crashed through barricades set up for a major festival in texas early thursday , slamming into a crowd outside a nightclub and killing a dutch man on a bicycle and a local woman on a moped .	twenty-three people were injured .	the incident stunned revelers at the annual south by southwest music , film and interactive gathering that draws tens of thousands to austin each year , and where nsa leaker edward snowden had spoken via live video conference from moscow three days earlier .	the motorist drove down a crowded street and ran into people in front of a nightclub around 12:30 a.m. , said austin police chief art acevedo .	he eventually crashed and tried to make a getaway on foot , but a police officer shocked him with a stun gun and took him into custody , acevedo said .	the victims were a woman from austin and a man from the netherlands , acevedo said .	a man who was on the moped is in good condition , he said .	no names have been released .	the driver , whose name also has not been released , faces two counts of capital murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault with a vehicle .	acevedo said it was an " intentional act , " and that the suspect has been booked and formal charges will be filed thursday afternoon .	two people were in critical condition thursday morning with life-threatening head injuries and three patients remain in serious condition , said dr. christopher ziebell , the emergency department director at the university medical center-brackenridge said .	he also said the driver was treated for minor injuries .

"	we are going to do our best for them , but these are some of the worst injuries that we see and not everybody with these kinds of injuries is going to survive . "	the toll could have been much higher .	the street had been packed with revelers just minutes earlier , but officials had cleared the area to create a fire lane .	austin police shut off traffic to a part of downtown for five days during the festival , turning normally busy roads into a large pedestrian mall to help festivalgoers reach dozens of music venues .	police said the incident started when an officer on a drunken-driving patrol tried to stop the silver toyota sedan at a gas station a few blocks away .	the car took off , weaving between parked cars then driving at high speed the wrong way down a one-way street .	the driver rammed through police barriers ?	three wooden pieces held up by metal poles ?	set up on red river street on the northeast edge of the entertainment district near the mohawk nightclub , where multiple acts were to perform wednesday night .	the bands x and teen had just wrapped up , and rapper tyler the creator was scheduled to perform at 1 a.m. .	an officer had to jump out of the way of the driver , acevedo said at thursday 's news conference .	the festival will continue because of the thousands of visitors in town , sxsw managing director roland swenson said thursday morning .	a spokeswoman for the festival said there would be schedule and venue changes .	acevedo said earlier thursday there were no plans to change safety protocols at the festival due to the accident .
eurozone ministers sent greece an euro8 billion ( $ 10.7 billion ) christmas rescue package tuesday to stem an immediate cash crisis yet failed to resolve fears that the common euro currency might be doomed .	stock markets around the world rose earlier in the day , hoping that intense pressure from the bond markets would finally force the 17-nation eurozone into quicker and more robust action .	but even as italy 's borrowing costs skyrocketed to a euro-era record , the 17 finance ministers only found a veneer of credibility to coat the euro 's rescue fund with more leverage .	they failed to increase the bailout fund to match earlier predictions and kicked other major financial issues ?	like a closer fiscal union ?	over to their bosses , the eu leaders meeting next week in brussels .	the ministers did agree to use the fund to offer financial protection of 20 to 30 percent to investors who bought new bonds of troubled eurozone nations , an effort to help those countries get back to borrowing on global markets again . "	we made important progress on a number of fronts , " jean-claude juncker , the eurozone chief , insisted late tuesday . "	this shows our complete determination to do whatever it takes to safeguard the financial stability of the euro . "	the eu 's monetary chief olli rehn said eurozone nations needed to work on many financial issues at once to ease global pressure on their currency . "	there is no one single silver bullet that will get us out of this crisis , " rehn told reporters .	but the question of how to beef up the leverage capacity of european financial stability facility from its current euro440 billion ( $ 587 billion ) to a hoped-for euro1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) was not resolved .	the fund is supposed to be a firewall that protects european nations from the financial chaos of their neighbors .	fund chief klaus regling remained vague on how beefed up it was after tuesday 's meeting in brussels , but assured reporters it was more than big enough to deal with europe 's immediate financial debt problems . "	to be clear , we do not expect investors to commit large amounts of money during the next few days or weeks , " regling said . "	leverage is a process over time . "	dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said investors had appeared less eager than originally anticipated . "	it will be very difficult to reach something in the region of a trillion .	maybe half of that , " he said .	italy remained an enormous concern .	carrying five times as much debt as greece , italy was battered for the third straight day in the bond markets , seeing its borrowing rates soar to unsustainable levels of 7.56 percent .	investors appear increasingly wary of the country 's chances of avoiding default ?	and making matters worse , the eurozone 's third largest economy is deemed too big for europe to bail out .	the ministers still insisted italy 's new prime minister would come through , saying he has promised to balance italy 's budget by 2013 . "	we have full confidence that mario monti will be able to deliver this program , " juncker said .	the eurozone ministers also called on the international monetary fund for more resources to help further protect europe 's embattled currency .	the imf has only about $ 390 billion available to lend , which would n't be anywhere near enough to rescue italy .	the eurozone ministers agreed to seek new ways to increase the resources of the imf through bilateral loans that could be used to protect eu nations facing financial trouble .	many economists say the 17 nations that use the euro have little choice but to have closer coordination of their spending and budget policies . "	if the eurozone is to survive , there needs to be more fiscal union , " said eswar prasad , an economics professor at cornell university .	but he suggested the imf could work with institutions like the european central bank .	funneling money through the imf would be more politically palatable for the ecb than directly aiding individual countries .	french finance minister francois baroin said it was " evident " that the eurozone was moving towards greater fiscal convergence and better coordination of budgets .	he said , far from indicating a loss of national sovereignty , these moves would guarantee countries ' sovereignty by helping them bring down their debt burdens . "	reducing our debts is the best way to guarantee our sovereignty , " he told reporters .	eurozone countries have enormous debts that must be refinanced ?	with euro638 billion ( $ 852 billion ) coming due in 2012 alone , 40 percent of which needs to be refinanced before may , according to barclays capital .	a failure of the euro would lead to drastic consequences around the world .	bank lending would freeze , stock markets would likely crash , european economies would go into a freefall and the u.s. and asia would take big hits to their economies as their exports to europe collapsed .	belgian 's finance minister saw the prospects of a two-speed europe , where if no common progress can be made among the 27 eu nations " you can not block those that share the same currency " from making decisions on their own .	the head of germany 's exporters association , meanwhile , urged an even more radical solution : having greece and portugal leave the eurozone .	bga president anton boerner called it the only way those two nations can spur the growth needed to overcome their crippling debts .	analysts were doubtful that new cash for greece would bring the financial relief that europe craves . "	the marginal impact of these bits of ' good news ' should be limited at best and investors will still cast a nervous eye towards this week 's bond auctions , " said geoffrey yu , an analyst at ubs .
the arkansas house will consider a bill that would have the state insurance department create the framework for a health insurance exchange as part of the federal health overhaul .	the bill by rep. fred allen , which failed by one vote last week , passed the 20-member insurance and commerce committee on monday by an 11-7 vote .	allen argued that without passage , the federal government would create and run the health insurance exchange and the state would lose local control .	opponents argued that the state could wait another year and still meet federal deadlines .	but insurance commissioner jay bradford says the state needs to have the framework in place by january 2013 and that the legislature could not consider the bill in next year 's federal session .

first came milton-based dogfish head craft brewery .	its steady success over the past 16 years put delaware on the craft beer map .	in the years since dogfish head 's founding , smaller breweries have sprouted across kent and sussex counties : the tiny 16 mile brewery , tucked off south bedford street in georgetown ; dover 's fordham and old dominion breweries ; and the evolution craft brewing company in delmar .	with upstate represented by a pair of iron hill breweries , stewart 's brewing company in bear and the upstart twin lakes brewing company , you might begin to think that beer is all we drink here in delaware .	heck , the state 's tourism board even created an official delaware wine & ale trail guide last year to help suds lovers track down dela-made brews .	with all those hops swirling in our tiny state , it should n't come as a surprise that wilmington has made the plunge and will celebrate delaware 's growing craft beer world , starting this weekend .	the first wilmington beer week will kick off with a citywide toast at 9 p.m. saturday as 10 restaurants and 14 select craft breweries from three sponsor distributors - standard , united and nks - combine for a week of pubs and pints . "	it 's only been the last few years that the local craft scene has really started to take off , " says jerry duphily , publisher of out & about magazine , the chief sponsor of wilmington beer week . "	we look at it as an opportunity to take advantage of a trend that 's really hot . "	duphily says the idea for wilmington beer week grew out of city restaurant week , which restaurateurs began to boost typically slow summer business .	next year , the weeklong celebration of beer will probably expand to include more casual pubs and taverns , like those found in trolley square .	but for the inaugural year , the event will take place mostly at sit-down dinner spots , with a slew of beer dinners and meet-and-greet events with brewers scheduled .	( go to wilmingtonbeerweek.com for the full lineup . ) "	it 's not a keg party , " duphily says . "	we wanted to get if off the ground with fine dining establishments . "	next year , duphily says the event could expand from 10 participating restaurants to possibly as many as 40 .	while wilmington beer week might be new , the general idea is not .	last month , the always-growing annual philly beer week featured 1,000 beer-related events stretched over 10 days .	and closer to home , newark is hosting its eighth annual downtown newark food & brew festival on july 23 .

officials from connecticut 's electric utilities said tuesday that they had begun reviewing their preparations and responses to the recent october nor'easter and the remnants of hurricane irene , each of which left hundreds of thousands of customers in the dark for days .	dave boguslawski , vice president for transmission at connecticut light and power , told members of gov. dannel p. malloy 's so-called two storm panel that the utility is working on a self-assessment and has asked the north american electric reliability corporation to review cl&p 's system .	utility officials already have identified some areas for improvement , such as working with towns more closely to open up roads blocked by downed trees and wires and speeding up the process of bringing in out-of-state crews and contractors to help with restoration . "	with the weather that 's coming and predicted to have more , we need to bring in crews even faster than our current ability , " acknowledged robert hybsch , vice president of customer operations at cl&p .	malloy 's committee is expected to provide the governor with recommendations for policy changes and possible legislation in december .	it 's one of numerous studies underway , including a hearing held by the general assembly 's insurance and real estate committee , which is reviewing the insurance industry 's response to the two storms .	each storm left hundreds of thousands of power customers in the dark for days ?	some for as long as 11 days .	and in many communities , they also left relationships with local officials frayed . "	we need real communication from cl&p , " said somers first selectwoman lisa pellegrini , whose town did not have the electricity entirely restored by cl&p until 12 days after the october storm hit . "	if it 's going to take two weeks , tell us it 's going to take two weeks . "	as with irene , some town officials complained they could not get straight answers from cl&p , the state 's largest utility , about when power was going to be restored .	they also described a lack of real-time information about outages ; cl&p liaisons who were helpful but had little to no information ; cl&p liaisons who could n't be reached ; a lack of tree and power line crews designated to particular communities ; confusion about whether the power was restored in certain neighborhoods ; and a lack of understanding by cl&p about local officials ' priorities for power restoration , information they were given during irene . "	i understand these are horrific situations .	in my opinion , ( the power ) was out much longer than what was necessary , " said tolland town manager steve werbner , who said he received physical threats from angry residents after cl&p failed to meet its goal of restoring electricity to 99 percent of customers eight days after the october storm .	after he told cl&p about the threats , werbner said tolland got three more liaisons , a high-level manager and all the crews it needed .	hybsch stressed that both storms hit the state very hard .	there were an unprecedented 16,101 " trouble spots " during the aftermath of irene .	following the october nor'easter , there were 25,500 " trouble spots . "	the pre-halloween storm was particularly damaging because many trees still had leaves on their branches , which were pulled down by the heavy , wet snow .	besides bringing in out-of-state crews sooner , hybsch said cl&p is reaching out to a national organization to open up a discussion on ways to improve the mutual-aid process .	cl&p also recommended that a tagging process for downed communication wires be created .	hybsch said the electric utilities typically get all the calls for downed wires .	but often those are not electrical wires , but cable or telephone wires , ultimately slowing the electric utilities ' overall restoration response .	hybsch also suggested that all connecticut cities and towns use standardized data that can be used to assess damage and the state come up with a comprehensive vegetation management plan .	additionally , he said cl&p is willing to work with towns and the state to conduct a statewide emergency restoration drill .	cl&p president and coo jeffrey butler , who appeared at numerous televised briefings with malloy following the recent snow storm , did not attend tuesday 's hearing .	during the meeting , representatives from wireless providers spoke about proposed legislation that would require generators to be installed at cellphone towers .	michael malenich , the director of network engineering for new england verizon wireless , said 90 percent of verizon 's sites have backup generators or the ability to bring in temporary generators .	he said it is a company policy .	but john emra , the regional vice president for external affairs at at&t questioned whether such legislation would be legal and feasible for his company , which has towers located on rented property .	he called it a " one-size-fits-all mandate .

@ by larry copeland usa today minneapolis - the morning rush hour traffic on interstate 35w is crawling .	the highway , which connects downtown minneapolis and its northern and southern suburbs , is the busiest road in the state .	when traffic snarls here , back-ups spread across the region .	a year ago , peggy birler , 45 , would have been right in the thick of it , spending up to an hour driving alone to work .	today , birler has a much shorter commute : she drives less than a mile to a park & ride lot , boards a bus for a 10-minute trip downtown , @zipping along in a bus-only lane , then walks 1 1/2 blocks to her office . "	when i drove in , it was just too much , with the congestion and everything , " says birler , marketing manager at dunham , a mechanical and electrical engineering firm in downtown minneapolis . "	i was a little nervous about taking the bus .	now , i would n't go back to driving . "	getting people such as birler to choose public transit , carpools , biking , telecommuting or other alternatives to driving to work solo is a major part of a campaign to relieve congestion on i-35w and other roads here .	the state is spending $ 500 million , including $ 133 million in federal money granted to cities running innovative projects , on a broad effort to ease logjams on i-35w .	officials here say it 's working .	i-35w used to be " a road you wanted to avoid , " says nick thompson , who manages congestion-relief efforts for the minnesota department of transportation . "	there was congestion any day of the week , any time of the day .	now , this is the next-generation freeway . "	commuter use of three park & ride lots serving the highway has increased by 16 percent , 19 percent and 25 percent ; trips on i-35w are an average 10-15 minutes faster , and the agency has achieved free-flowing traffic in express lanes on the highway 98 percent of the time .	the i-35w project is part of a regional approach that emphasizes creative management of the existing transportation system , rather than expanding it , and seeks to make alternative commuting options widely available .	the goal : provide residents with a reliable , on-time commute option every day .	spurred by a bridge collapse on i-35w in 2007 that killed 13 motorists and injured 145 , minnesota also has fundamentally changed its transportation funding system , approving billions for roads , bridges and transit ; the state also gave metropolitan governments the power to implement sales taxes for transit improvements .	the congestion-easing efforts have helped make the twin cities , along with seattle , a national leader among cities working to keep traffic moving , says tim lomax , a congestion specialist at the texas transportation institute at texas a&m university . "	those two are at the forefront of what 's going on , " says lomax , co-author of the annual urban mobility report , which ranks congestion trends in 90 cities . "	the things that stand out in my mind are the use of information , very detailed information that drives their decisions about day-to-day operations and long-term projects .	they are not only thought leaders but action leaders . "	the cost of congestion snarled traffic is a frustrating reality for the modern driver .	it 's also a walloping blow to the nation 's economy .	congestion costs the united states $ 87.2 billion a year in gasoline and lost productivity , according to lomax 's most recent report .	that 's 2.8 billion gallons of wasted fuel and 4.2 billion hours of wasted time .	many transportation analysts agree that the usa ca n't build its way out of congestion .	when a new road is built , usually at great cost , it quickly fills with traffic .	congestion is a fact of life in large urban areas , lomax says , but roads do n't have to be congested all day .	the best way to deal with congestion is smart traffic management .	that involves controlling how many cars are on a highway at a given time through tools such as flexible tolling , in which drivers pay a toll to use special lanes during congested periods , and ramp metering , in which a traffic signal controls the pace of vehicles merging from an entrance ramp .	it also includes quickly clearing wrecks and other incidents ; providing transit options and getting drivers to use them , and synchronizing traffic signals , not only on primary roads but also on parallel corridors that drivers use as alternatives .	most cities use a combination of these methods .	among the steps taken to cut congestion here : -- the twin cities try to ensure that transit riders and carpoolers avoid daily traffic tie-ups .	the region has 300 miles of bus-only lanes , in which the right shoulder of highways is opened for buses during peak traffic ; that 's more than the rest of the usa combined .	minnesota also recently added " priced dynamic shoulder lanes , " in which the left shoulder of highways is restricted to buses , carpools and single-car occupants who pay a toll .	@ -- the state rebuilt some key streets in downtown minneapolis , widening sidewalks , eliminating on-street parking and adding a second bus lane , which allows buses to pass stopped buses .	since december , those changes have enabled buses on the affected streets to increase operating speeds by 60 percent , says bob gibbons , spokesman for metro transit , which provides 90 percent of local bus service here .	-- the region , which has had just one light rail line since 2004 , is expanding its network .	a central corridor connecting downtown minneapolis and downtown st. paul is expected to begin service in 2014 ; a third line , connecting minneapolis and suburban eden prairie , was approved in may .	-- minneapolis emphasizes alternative forms of commuting .	just 35 percent of workers downtown drive to work alone , about half the national average ; 40 percent use transit , 20 percent vanpools or carpools and 5 percent bike or walk , says dan maclaughlin , executive director of the downtown minneapolis transportation management organization , a non-profit partnership between the city and the business community .	-- minndot is trying to cut congestion by encouraging employers to offer workers flexible schedules that allow them to work from home .	the impact is tiny but growing : more than 30 employers in the twin cities now offer telework options .	seattle cuts collisions across the usa , about 25 percent of congestion is caused by collisions .	seattle , which has one of the nation 's most comprehensive traffic management systems , aims to reduce backups by cutting the number of accidents .	seattle next month becomes one of the first u.s. cities @to use a european-style active traffic management system , in which signs above each lane flash variable speed limits , whether a lane is open ahead and up-to-the-minute traffic information .	the signs , installed on the northbound lanes of interstate 5 , one of the state 's most heavily traveled corridors where crashes cause up to 70 percent of congestion , will display speed limits from 40 mph to 60 mph , depending on traffic conditions .	this will allow drivers to slow down well before they reach bottlenecks , thus reducing rear-end collisions and keeping traffic moving , although more slowly . "	in germany , belgium and england , they 've seen a 30 percent reduction in injury crashes with the system , " says patricia michaud , a spokeswoman for the washington state department of transportation .	the department installed roadway traffic sensors , data-carrying fiber optics and new traffic cameras on a 9-mile stretch of i-5 in south seattle .	information on traffic conditions is fed into a traffic-management center and overhead lane signs respond automatically ; the process is monitored 24 hours a day by traffic engineers .	the state 's wide-ranging effort includes 230 miles of lanes restricted to vehicles carrying multiple occupants , ramp metering and use of traffic cameras and variable message signs , says craig stone , director of the toll division of the state department of transportation .	other efforts : -- travel times have improved on 14 of 18 surveyed commuter routes .	-- thirty-two of 48 high-occupancy vehicle routes running parallel to the most crowded lanes show improved travel times .	-- the time it takes to clear collisions , disabled vehicles and other congestion-causing incidents has been cut from an average 18 minutes to 12.9 minutes .	-- tow companies hired by the state can receive a $ 2,500 bonus if they respond to major crashes within 30 minutes and clear them within 90 minutes .	moved by tragedy the collapse of the i-35w bridge over the mississippi river during the evening rush hour on aug. 1 , 2007 , prompted the state legislature in 2008 to authorize a transportation funding package that will generate $ 6.6 billion over 10 years for roads , bridges and transit projects .	it included an 8.5-cent increase in the state gas tax - the first rise in 18 years - and granted seven counties in the twin cities metropolitan area the authority to impose a quarter-cent sales tax for transit projects .	the tragedy also boosted efforts to pursue alternative commutes by employers , maclaughlin says . "	the business community came up with a bunch of creative ways to get their people downtown .	the catastrophe motivated people to really work on this issue , and that has carried over . "	merete wells , 25 , a senior associate with the minneapolis public relations firm carmichael lynch , takes advantage of an unusually creative option offered by her company : a " shoe incentive . " "	they will give you $ 50 toward the purchase of a new pair of shoes a couple of times a year if you walk to work , " wells says . "	it 's a nice little incentive . "	she used to drive to work from st. paul .	however , when her old volvo started to wear down , she decided to move closer to work instead of buying a new car .	now , instead of a 30 - to 45-minute commute in summer , which stretched to 60 to 90 minutes in winter , she walks 10 minutes to work .	many minneapolis workers now view alternative commute incentives as an employee benefit , says kirsten spreck , director of corporate real estate at thrivent financial for lutherans , a faith-based financial services organization .	almost all of its 1,200 minneapolis employees participate in the incentive program , which offers $ 50 - to $ 100-a-month credits in pre-tax dollars , which the employees can use to pay for parking , a transit pass , and carpool , motorcycle , biking or walking costs such as shoes .	david levinson , a civil engineering professor at the university of minnesota , cautions that everything being done here is " just pieces to a puzzle .	i would n't say they solve the congestion problem by any means .	only a small percentage of the workforce actually works downtown . "	across the region , only about 2 percent of all work trips are on transit . "	that sounds pretty bad , and it is , " he says . "	but nationally , it 's less than 1 percent . "	while there 's still much room for improvement , the twin cities ' efforts are winning national praise . "	the aggressive operations focus that minndot has is reflected in projects like the bus shoulder lanes , which a lot of places are n't contemplating because it 's out of the ordinary , " lomax says . "	it 's a simple idea that 's pretty complex to get done .	but the benefits are significant . "
the varied terrain found in eastern kentucky has given a group of search and rescue dogs a chance to experience different types of territory as they train for emergencies .	the kentucky search dog association brought wilderness tracking dogs and cadaver dogs to train in floyd county .	wymt-tv ( http://bit.ly/1miwv41 ) says more than a dozen dogs and their handlers spent time training there recently .	the trainers say the area is perfect for practicing .	heather suedkamp says the dogs and handlers can be called to lakes , strip mines or wooded areas , so the terrain is ideal for training .	the visit also allowed a chance to work with the floyd county search and rescue squad .	suedkamp says it 's a chance to use their knowledge of water rescue along with the group 's experience with dogs .
cruise ship passenger tax money that sitka receives is down , and that has officials concerned .	around 120,000 passengers stepped off of cruise ships in the southeast alaska city last year .	municipal officials expected $ 5 for each one as the city 's share of alaska 's $ 34.50 state cruise ship passenger tax .	but , when the check arrived from the state , it showed that fewer than 83,000 passengers in sitka were assessed the tax .	it turns out that not every guest aboard a major cruise ship stopping at an alaska port is taxed .	that 's because the tax is assessed only for passengers who spend 72 hours or more per voyage in state waters .	the alaska department of revenue says a third of the cruise visitors who stopped in sitka did not qualify .

fbi officials in buffalo will discuss their investigation into vandalism that damaged an amtrak train traveling through the cattaraugus indian reservation .	a 2 p.m. news conference is scheduled for thursday .	the fbi on july 9 offered a $ 10,000 reward for information after a passenger train struck railroad ties positioned across the csx tracks on the seneca nation reservation .	no one was injured but the train 's air lines were damaged .	investigators noted they 'd seen " no mail ?	no rail " signs nearby , apparently referencing the prevent all cigarette trafficking act , a new federal law that threatens many seneca businesses by preventing them from shipping cigarettes through the mail .	seneca leaders have condemned the vandalism .
authorities are investigating after a man 's body was discovered in the arkansas river in pope county over the weekend .	pope county sheriff aaron duvall says the body was found in the river saturday near the sweeden island park area .	duvall tells the courier ( http://bit.ly/1o0uz1z ) that there was no identification on the body , but authorities did recover a pair of blue jeans and a cell phone .	duvall says the body will be sent to the arkansas medical examiner 's office in little rock for identification .	but the sheriff says there 's no indication that the body belongs to michael shane caldwell , who 's been missing since a jan. 12 traffic stop and was last seen trying to swim away from arkansas state police in the arkansas river .
david freed , the republican candidate for pennsylvania attorney general , said friday that he would be an advocate for expanding the use of video recording for law enforcement .	in an interview with the associated press , freed said videos can provide crucial evidence to convict suspects of crimes , for example , or reaffirm a police officer 's statement claiming to have pulled over a motorist for drunken driving because the vehicle was weaving . "	i like ( criminal ) processing being videoed .	i like in-car videos .	i like the video and audio on the police officer because there is no question then about what happened , " he said . "	you can play those in court , and it 's the best evidence you can have . "	during the hourlong interview , freed said he sees no reason for the next attorney general to review the department 's handling of the jerry sandusky child sexual abuse case .	he also outlined plans to fine-tune the agency 's focus and said he owns a handgun .	freed , 41 , is running on his experience ?	seven years as cumberland county 's elected district attorney and eight years before that as a county prosecutor .	while acknowledging that his democratic foe , kathleen kane , is a former seasoned prosecutor in lackawanna county , he said his management experience as a da gives him a broader perspective .	the camp hill resident hopes to become the next in a line of republican attorneys general that has been unbroken since the post became an elected office in 1980 .	his father-in-law , leroy zimmerman , was the state 's first elected attorney general and served two four-year terms .	freed defended the use of investigating grand juries in complicated cases such as the one that resulted in last month 's conviction of sandusky , a retired penn state assistant football coach , on 45 counts for sexually abusing 10 boys during a 15-year span .	gov. tom corbett was the attorney general when that office launched its investigation in 2008 , and critics including kane have called for an investigation of why sandusky was not charged sooner .	the attorney general 's office has defended the pace of the sandusky investigation as a reflection of prosecutors ' methodical approach .	asked whether he was satisfied with the investigation , freed said , " the effectiveness of the case ... speaks for itself with the conviction . " "	i will never be able to answer the questions of whether things were done for political purposes .	those questions are for other people to answer , " he said .	if elected , freed said he would establish two new units ?	one focusing on cyber-crime and a special victims unit that would include a victim advocate to expedite action on cases district attorneys refer to the attorney general because of potential conflicts or other problems .	freed said he also plans to empanel a task force to scrutinize the use of bath salts and other synthetic drugs .	asked whether he is a gun owner , freed said he owns one handgun and keeps it at his office . "	i do n't carry it with me .	... the only time that i use it is to qualify with it , do some target shooting every year , " he said .	freed said he supports a bill to overhaul the state 's wiretapping law for the first time in 14 years , calling it a reasonable proposal that would help law enforcement .	a version passed by the house , among other things , would allow people to record conversations without other parties ' consent if they believe it might provide evidence of a serious crime .	freed said the current law , which requires mutual consent , bars incriminating recordings from being admitted as evidence even though modern technology makes recording easier than ever .	the proposal would " catch us up with current technology , " he said . "	the possibility is certainly out there that people can record themselves being victimized on their ... smartphones and that could be valid evidence that we 're artificially unable to use . "
a former senior officer in burundi 's army told the associated press that he and other army officers have formed a rebel movement known as the republican forces of burundi to remove nkurunziza from power .	the new rebel group 's main objective is to protect burundians who are being killed because they are protesting the violation of the country 's constitution by nkurunziza who extended his time in power , said lt. col. edouard nshimirimana , who was in charge of military transmissions and communications before he defected in september .	burundi has been rocked by turmoil since april when it was announced that nkurunziza would run for a third term in office .	nkurunziza won elections in july but the violence has since escalated .	the rebel force was behind the recent attacks on three military camps , where they captured enough weapons to fight burundi 's army , said nshimirimana , who trained at iscam , a military school in burundi , and was commander of the 17 battalion .	at least 87 people were killed in bujumbura in december when rebels attacked two military barracks in bujumbura and one in mujejuru in the bujumbura rural province .	more than 400 people have been killed in burundi and some 220,000 have fled to neighboring countries since april .	violent street protests in opposition to nkurunziza staying in power boiled over into a failed military coup in may .	the leader of the coup , godefroid niyombare , is at large but a former defense minister is among 28 officials facing trial for the failed overthrow .	the other objective of the rebellion is to protect the arusha agreement that limits burundian presidents to two terms in office , said nshimirimana .	all forces against nkurunziza are united under the republican forces of burundi , nshimirimana said . "	we have no choice and the world is not helping burundians who are being killed , he said . "	we are calling on all burundians who believe in the rule of law to join us , " nshimirimana said , adding that many soldiers of various ranks who are suspected of opposing nkurunziza 's third term in office , have been harassed , arrested and in some cases killed by members of security services .	the arusha agreement ended burundi 's 13-year civil war 10 years ago and integrated former hutu rebels into the tutsi-dominated army to create a more ethnically balanced force . "	the arusha agreement was the solution to burundi 's political problems .	now that it has collapsed , the war is inevitable , " nshimirimana told ap .	the arusha agreement introduced power-sharing quotas in the government institutions and military forces , with the objective of protecting the minority tutsis by giving them a disproportionately large share of power in government .	tutsis make up about 14 percent of burundi 's 10 million people , while the hutu make up about 85 percent .	although burundi 's current unrest has been based on political divisions , there is growing international concern that the country threatens to descend into ethnic violence , such as neighboring rwanda 's 1994 genocide by majority hutus against the minority tutsi .	burundi 's army , spokesman col. gaspard baratuza , was not immediately available for comment but had earlier said after nshimirimana 's defection that burundi had a force of 30,000 army capable of defending the country .
we did n't routinely do routine things well a year and a half ago when it came to patient scheduling , " paul roberts said during a recent interview . "	but guess what ?	we figured out where our problems were , we brought in new staff , we retrained existing staff , and our programs are now leaps and bounds ahead of where we were a year and a half ago . "	roberts was named the interim leader of the medical center earlier this month following the retirement of the former director , cynthia mccormack .	mccormack was one of several supervisors here who were accused of falsifying records , telling subordinates to falsify records and withholding accurate information in order to meet a requirement that patients be seen within 14 days of scheduling an appointment .	va officials said mccormack 's departure was unrelated to the accusations .	the details of the punishments for her and five other superiors have so far been sealed due to personnel rules .	but several oversight agencies have criticized local va leadership for its scheduling practices .	the u.s. office of special counsel even issued a scathing report in july that said it could n't rule out whether any local veterans died or were harmed because of the practices .	similar scandals at other va hospitals prompted congressional calls for reforms and the resignation of then-va secretary eric k. shinseki last year .	roberts , who previously was the local facility 's assistant director , said he understands work is needed to rebuild confidence in the local facility and the va as a whole .	saying it 's " a new day , " he argued that a culture change has occurred within leadership here and in washington , d.c. roberts added his top priority for his tenure is to make sure veterans are seen and treated as fast as possible . "	we are continuously working to improve access to care , " he told the wyoming tribune eagle ( http://bit.ly/1nvbrym ) . "	we 've done a great job in the last year , but there is more work to be done . "	va data , released nov. 15 , shows that 86.1 percent of patients at the cheyenne va medical center had their appointments scheduled within 30 days .	that is below the national average of 91.9 percent .	roberts said staffing has been one of the challenges in making sure patients can be seen as fast as possible . "	what we wrestle with is some of things other health-care organizations out west wrestle with as well , " he said . "	we are in a rural environment , and we have to compete with ( larger cities ) . "	but he noted that staffing levels have jumped from 638 to 914 in the two and a half years he has been here .	roberts said this shows the va 's commitment to the issue .	roberts said even seemingly small matters , such as the medical center 's phone systems , are being overhauled . "	a year ago , we could n't figure out where our calls were going , we could n't figure out abandonment rates , we could n't figure out how long people were put on hold for , and we just did n't have the technology to do all that , " he said . "	now we do have a system that can do all that . "	roberts said about 8 to 9 percent of calls are now being dropped because veterans get frustrated or hang up for whatever reason .	he said that rate was likely double in the past , but he would still like it to get down to around 5 percent .	he stressed there also is a different mentality when it comes to red tape . "	what they are saying is we want to have policies , procedures and regulations , " he said . "	but let 's look for ones that tell us what we can do to help the veterans instead of looking at the ones that prevent us from helping someone . "	but some local veterans and veterans groups are taking a wait-and-see approach for now .	travis deti , the laramie county representative on the wyoming veterans commission , said he hopes the commission and other local veterans groups will be consulted before the next permanent director is chosen . "	from the standpoint of the commission , we would like a chance to review the candidate and their track record assisting veterans , " he said .	dale winston , commander of the local veterans of foreign wars post 1881 , meanwhile said he is impressed by some of the changes already underway , such as a new mental-health center that is planned to open in january . "	i think it 'll help the veterans a lot , especially the ones suffering from ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) , " he said . "	anything that helps our veterans , i 'm all for . "
long before smartphones turned so many of us into amateur photographers and revolutionized how we depict each other through social media , there were the works of french impressionist edouard manet .	known for portraits of friends and celebrities of his era , the painter often called " the first modern artist " came of age during the mid-1800s when photography first became available to the public .	he even kept his own collection of photos of the subjects he painted .	manet 's portraits and how they were influenced by photography are the focus of " manet : portraying life " at the toledo museum of art , the only u.s. museum to host the exhibition before it moves to the royal academy of arts in london next winter .	the show that opened this month and runs through the end of the year features 40 paintings from public and private collections , including some of his best-known works .	instead of assembling a retrospective of manet 's works , the two museums chose portraits that would open the discussion of what impact photography had on manet 's paintings . "	we 're not suggesting an exact reliance on photography , but this was a new medium in the era that he 's painting and it was very important , " said co-curator lawrence nichols .	it is the first time a manet ( 1832-1883 ) exhibit has looked solely at his portraits , said nichols , the museum 's curator of european and american painting and sculpture before 1900 .	the museum 's own collection includes manet 's portrait of a childhood friend who wrote extensively about the artist .	the works include straight forward portraits of men in top hats and women in flowing dresses .	there are others that illustrate the change in around his home in paris , revealing social unrest and the industrial revolution .	sprinkled throughout the exhibition are photos of his subjects ?	some are original and others are digitized from an album manet kept ?	to give insight into how he interpreted them the people he painted .	in one photo , the tie and beard of a man bears a noticeable similarity to one of his paintings . "	he had images in his life beyond the paintings he made , " nichols said .	about half of manet 's entire works , which rank among the greatest of the impressionist movement , were portraits or scenes from everyday life .	some of the portraits in the show evoke the photos that we see today on social networking sites like facebook ?	they 're small and straightforward yet reveal something personal about each subject .	and they reveal how we record and connect with each other .	the proliferation of images now is similar to what was happening during manet 's time when the camera made portraits ubiquitous , he said .	these are ideas that the century-and-a-half old paintings can convey to a modern audience , nichols said . "	this is very much about 2012 and what it means to conceive of yourself , to be perceived by someone else , " he said .	manet 's portraits are spread throughout eight galleries into the museum .	the exhibit neatly flows into another show featuring nearly 100 mostly black and white photographs of hollywood legends from the 1920s to the 1960s .	outside the hall , there are 700 facebook-like images of community members , museum volunteers and staff . "	these threads together make it very contemporary , " said toledo museum director brian kennedy . "	the prints and photos take us back literally through time to manet .	it covers all the various ways people use various media to represent each other . "
colgate-palmolive co. 's second-quarter net income rose more than 7 percent as the consumer products maker kept selling more of its palmolive dishwashing liquid , ajax cleanser and colgate toothpaste .	however , colgate is being hurt more than it expected by the devaluation of venezuela 's currency and said it will drag down full-year earnings more than expected .	shares fell in premarket trading .	the world 's largest toothpaste maker has maintained sales of its name-brand products even as shoppers traded down in the weak economy .	it is also expanding in developing markets including south america and boosting advertising to keep people spending .	colgate , based in new york , said thursday that it earned $ 603 million , or $ 1.17 per share , in the three months ending in late june .	that 's up from $ 562 million , or $ 1.07 per share , in the same quarter last year .	revenue rose almost 2 percent to $ 3.81 billion , up from $ 3.75 billion last year .	analysts surveyed by thomson reuters expected the new york company to earn $ 1.16 per share on revenue of $ 3.94 billion .	volume among the company 's line of products held up well in the quarter , climbing 3 percent around the world .	the outlier again was hill 's pet food division , which accounts for 13 percent of company sales .	there , volume fell 4 percent .	pricing held up well , too , alleviating a major concern for investors .	some companies have been cutting prices and running promotions to keep people buying , but that means profit margins shrink .	but colgate said pricing climbed half a percent during the quarter around the globe . "	overall , we are very pleased to have delivered solid results this quarter , despite heightened competitive activity and difficult economic conditions around the world , " chairman , president and ceo ian cook said in a statement .	also thursday , colgate-palmolive said the devalued venezuelan currency would likely be a bigger drag on full-year results than previously expected .	the company now expects that country 's currency devaluation would drag down full-year profit by 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share .	it had previously expected profit to be reduced between 6 cents per share and 10 cents per share .	colgate shares fell $ 2.87 , or 3.4 percent , to $ 80.99 in premarket trading thursday .	shares closed wednesday at $ 83.86 .

last month 's heavy flooding in northeastern minnesota caused an estimated $ 20 million in damage to duluth 's parks and left the city 's creeks too dangerous to swim in , city officials said .	all 14 duluth park trails were damaged , and restoring the trails will cost nearly $ 10 million , the duluth news tribune reported saturday ( http://bit.ly/msuovm ) .	kathy bergen , the city 's parks and recreation manager , said people can continue using the parks while they 're being restored , but they should be careful . "	even though our parks are open , things are not the way they used to be , " bergen said . "	you ca n't make any assumptions . "	bergen said it 's not safe to swim in any of the creeks because heavy rains shifted boulders , rocks and flood-related debris in the water , making familiar swimming holes shallower and unsafe to jump in and making their banks unstable . "	you could be standing on the edge of a bank and think it looks stable , and then it could collapse right under you , " she said . "	it could take months or more than a year to stabilize . "	in chester park on friday , city officials pointed out steep washouts , a destroyed cross-country skiing bridge and a pond that was washed out .	in lincoln park , a bike path was undermined , retaining walls of the historic miller creek bridge were washed out and large rocks were deposited in the creek in piles .	park work is complicated and will take time because of the different agencies involved and permits needed , said kelly fleissner , the city 's manager of maintenance operations . "	people are going to continue to use our parks until they 're fixed , " he said . "	but there are little trip hazards , edges of roads that somebody could stumble off of .	knowing we ca n't put up enough signs and ca n't have people everywhere making sure everybody is safe , we want to point these out .	if you are going to use the parks , use common sense .

justin bieber 's new anti-cyberbullying video helped his manager and a record executive resolve a legal predicament .	the video released wednesday by a new york prosecutor is part of a plea deal settling misdemeanor charges filed after a fan frenzy at a mall in 2009 .	the manager and executive were arrested after police ordered a bieber autograph session at a clothing store shut down over fears someone could get hurt .	more than 3,000 teens and younger girls had arrived by 1 p.m. for an event scheduled for 4 p.m. , leading to the cancellation .	bieber never appeared , but police said at one point while they were trying to disperse the crowd they were hindered by a message from bieber 's twitter account stating : " on my way to roosevelt field mall in long island , ny to sign and meet fans !	i 'm pumped .	see u there . "	prosecutors said police had asked bieber 's staff to send a tweet from his account to notify fans that the event was cancelled .	though they tried , island def jam record music group employees were unable to tweet on bieber 's account because the singer 's manager , scott braun , had changed the account 's password to prevent anyone from cancelling the event .	about 90 minutes after the police made their initial request , they said braun sent two tweets cancelling the event , and the crowd dispersed within 15 minutes , prosecutors said .	braun and def jam records executive james roppo were charged with misdemeanors .	the charges were later dropped in a plea agreement that permitted bieber 's record company and a management company to plead guilty to fire code violations , as well as reimburse nassau county almost $ 8,000 .	the agreement also called for bieber to record the anti-cyberbullying public service announcement video .	during the 11-minute video introduced by nassau county district attorney kathleen rice , whose office negotiated the plea deal , bieber speaks to a long island high school student about her experiences with cyberbullying .	an attorney also offers definitions on cyberbullying , sexting and other offenses and warns teens they could be subject to criminal prosecutions if they are caught . "	the internet can be used as a place to have a greater positive impact on the world , " bieber tells viewers . "	the web should be used to inspire others , not spread hate or hurt . "	rice said after the plea agreement was released that both the record company 's and bieber 's management " have learned from this incident , and since the roosevelt field appearance , have successfully implemented carefully executed safety plans at other venues .

the legislative elections had been postponed for nearly four years due to a political showdown between haiti 's executive and opposition , and they have been billed as a crucial test of the country 's electoral system ahead of a presidential vote in october .	sunday 's first round seeks to fill two thirds of the 30-member senate and the entire 99-chamber of deputies .	but a number of polling stations across the country were still waiting for ballots a few hours after voting was supposed to start at 6:00 a.m. ( 1000 gmt ) .	in sections of port-au-prince , voters who began trickling in around dawn grew exasperated after being told they could n't cast ballots because their names were n't on official voting lists " this is very frustrating .	are they trying to discourage voting ? "	gardener gerald henry complained to a reporter after election workers turned him away .	in the crowded capital , at least three voting centers were shut down by authorities after fistfights broke out , partisans attempted to stuff ballot boxes and other irregularities that were clearly visible .	at one voting center in downtown port-au-prince , groups of young men ripped up paper ballots as heavily armed police shot into the air to re-establish order .	rocks were thrown in response before authorities closed the polling station .	the vote was taking place roughly eight months after haiti 's legislature was dissolved because the terms of lawmakers expired before new elections could be held .	it 's the first election haiti has held under martelly , who has governed by decree since parliament dissolved in january .	in the absence of elections , martelly has been accused of stacking the deck in his favor by appointing mayors and other municipal officials to replace those whose terms expired .	roughly 5.8 million people were registered to vote and over 1,850 candidates from nearly 130 political parties were running .	elections in haiti are never easy and the country 's provisional electoral council has long been criticized for votes plagued by disorganization , ballot irregularities and fraud allegations .	president michel martelly , who took office in may 2011 and can not run for a consecutive term , is in the final year of a five-year term .	he has been governing without a legislature since january .	final results were not expected for several days and a significant amount of work will be needed to get the next parliament up and running after it is installed .	the first round of haiti 's presidential election and the second round of local elections are set for oct. 25 .

regulators have approved a deal allowing hawaii fishermen to attribute up to 1,000 metric tons of bigeye tuna catch to guam , said mike tosatto , national marine fisheries service regional administrator for the pacific islands .	the agreement will enable hawaii fishermen to keep catching ahi as usual and deliver their haul to honolulu .	in exchange , hawaii fishermen will pay $ 200,000 toward the development of the fishing industry on guam . "	we want to inform the public that fish will continue to be available through the holidays , " tosatto said .	environmentalists say the arrangement contributes to the overfishing of bigeye tuna in the western and central pacific . "	there 's just absolutely no way to reconcile that behavior with what the science says , which is that all fishing nations -- including the united states -- need to show some restraint .	and need to reduce catch , not increase catch , which is what the fisheries service is allowing to happen here , " said david henkin , an attorney for earthjustice .	the 26-member nation western and central pacific fisheries commission , which regulates fishing from east and southeast asia to waters around hawaii , set a limit of about 3,500 metric tons for hawaii longline fishermen this year .	the commission does n't set catch limits for territories .	but the fisheries service created a 2,000 metric ton limit for each of three u.s. territories -- american samoa , guam and the northern mariana islands -- then said hawaii fishermen may use up to half of these limits .	environmentalists argue this enables fishermen to circumvent international agreements aimed at controlling overfishing of bigeye .	hawaii fishermen met their original bigeye catch limit for 2015 , set by the international commission , in august .	they resumed fishing in october , using the northern marianas ' quota .	now they 'll be able to keep fishing until the end of the year thanks to an agreement with guam , which was finalized wednesday .	tosatto said the transition will be seamless to the fishing industry and consumers , for the most part .	several environmental groups represented by earthjustice have sued the fisheries service to stop the attribution of bigeye catch to u.s. territories .	the plaintiffs argue the practice undermines international agreements aimed at eliminating the overfishing of bigeye .	the case is pending in federal court in honolulu .

supporters of gun control in washington state are laying the groundwork for an initiative campaign to try and expand the use of background checks if a similar proposal fails to pass congress .	christian sinderman , a political consultant aiding the group washington alliance for gun responsibility , said monday that organizers have n't decided whether the initiative would take place this year or next year .	the group is engaged in discussions and plans to make a decision by the end of this month . "	we 're 100 percent committed to moving forward , unless or until something 's on the president 's desk , " sinderman said .	gun buyers must undergo background checks when they purchase a weapon from a federally licensed firearms dealer .	a bipartisan effort in the u.s. senate would expand that to cover transactions at gun shows and the internet , and lawmakers are expected to begin debating that proposal tuesday .	washington state lawmakers considered their own bill to expand background checks earlier this year , but the measure failed to get enough votes to pass the state house .	sinderman said the group has n't yet developed wording of the law but plans to use the plan developed in the washington legislature as a basis while also looking at actions in other states .	he said the group is currently assessing what resources it might have available .	supporters of the background checks say criminals and mentally ill people can easily acquire guns at gun shows or through private transactions .	opponents say those people will be able to acquire guns in other ways and background checks simply create an obstacle for law-abiding people .	the u.s. senate proposal would still exempt transactions such as a sale of a gun between family members from the background check requirement .	a lobbyist for the nra in washington state did not return a call seeking comment monday .	the group had worked earlier this year to try influencing washington state lawmakers who supported background checks , particularly focusing on republican rep. mike hope , a seattle police officer who sponsored the legislation .

former kansas prosecutor phill kline told a state ethics panel thursday that an allegation that he misled a kansas city-area grand jury investigating an abortion clinic rests on " mass confusion " about what he and his subordinates told the group .	the allegation is part of a professional misconduct complaint against kline .	it stems from actions by kline , an anti-abortion republican , during investigations of abortion providers from 2003 to 2007 while he was attorney general , and in 2007 and 2008 when he was johnson county district attorney .	kline resumed testifying in his own defense thursday .	he took the witness stand wednesday , after the state 's attorney disciplinary administrator finished presenting the case against kline .	a three-member panel of the state board for discipline of attorneys hopes to wrap up its hearings friday .	the complaint alleges kline and his staff mishandled patients ' medical records and misled other officials to further potential prosecutions of abortion providers , which he strongly disputes .	the ethics panel will recommend to the kansas supreme court whether he should face sanctions ?	although the court has criticized kline in past decisions in abortion cases .	among other things , the complaint alleges that kline and his staff in the johnson county district attorney 's office gave incomplete and misleading information to a grand jury that convened in late 2007 to investigate a planned parenthood clinic in the kansas city suburb of overland park .	the allegation came from the group 's presiding juror , who already has testified . "	this is one of the areas where there 's mass confusion , " kline testified .	kline was voted out of both the attorney general 's and district attorney 's offices and is now a visiting assistant law professor at liberty university in lynchburg , va. .	the university was founded by evangelist jerry falwell .	in october 2007 , kline filed 107 criminal charges against the planned parenthood clinic , alleging it falsified documents and performed illegal abortions , which it strongly denies .	a preliminary hearing to determine whether the case goes to trial is scheduled for oct. 24-26 .	but even as kline filed those charges , anti-abortion groups used petitions signed by voters to force johnson county to convene a grand jury to investigate the same clinic .	however , the grand jury never issued an indictment .	kline 's attorneys attempted to cast doubt on testimony from stephanie hensel , the grand jury 's presiding juror .	at issue is what kline and his staff told grand jurors as they considered investigating whether the planned parenthood clinic had reported cases of sexual abuse of children to the state , as required by kansas law .	hensel testified that kline and his staff told the grand jury that any abortion involving a child under 16 had to be reported to the state as evidence of child abuse because the state 's age of consent for sex is 16 .	that would be in keeping with legal opinion kline had issued as attorney general in 2003 , but the issue inspired a federal lawsuit and legislators eventually rewrote the reporting law .	one of kline 's former subordinates , who faced an ethics complaint himself , agreed to an informal admonishment last year , acknowledging not giving the grand jury enough information about the law but not intentionally misleading it .	but , questioned by one of his attorneys thursday , kline pointed to passages in transcripts of grand jury meetings to contradict hensel 's version of events .	he said grand jurors received " a clear and accurate recitation " of the law .	as for hensel 's version of what the grand jury was told , kline said , " i never said that .	there was a presumption , but that 's not what was said . "	the disciplinary administrator 's office has portrayed hensel as the grand jury 's spokeswoman .	testimony has shown a strained relationship between the johnson county district attorney 's office under kline and the grand jury , which retained its own attorneys , not wanting to rely entirely on kline 's staff .	one of the grand jury 's attorneys , retired district judge larry mcclain , has testified that kline 's office was " kind of demonizing " planned parenthood .	he said he also told one of kline 's subordinates , " look , i just ca n't trust you anymore . "	kline and the subordinate testified that they did n't recall any such comment from mcclain .	and , pointing to the lack of disparaging comments about planned parenthood in the grand jury transcripts , kline said he and his staff remained professional throughout .	kline 's attorneys describe the grand jury as beset by internal disagreements , and kline testified thursday that the panel was " fractured . "	no grand jurors other than hensel have been identified publicly or have testified in the ethics case .	kline and his supporters also have questioned grand jury decisions , such as negotiating with planned parenthood attorneys to obtain records even after issuing a subpoena , which was never enforced .	during a break in testimony , kline said actions by hensel and the grand jury 's attorneys " killed " the panel 's investigation of the clinic .	he and anti-abortion groups have made much of an agreement with planned parenthood 's attorneys to obtain records ?	drafted but ultimately not followed ?	that would have limited how the documents could be used , even by the district attorney . "	this procedure was not an investigation , " kline said of the grand jury 's work . "	i 've never seen anything like it in my life . "

a proposal to cut business taxes and address the so-called " delaware loophole " that opponents say permits corporations to avoid state taxes neared a final vote in the pennsylvania house of representatives on tuesday as supporters defeated a series of democratic-sponsored amendments .	the bill would reduce the corporate net income tax rate from 10 percent to 7 percent over six years , and make other business-friendly tax changes .	democrats said it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually , a prediction the prime sponsor disputed . "	we actually believe there will be a net gain in revenue in the long-run , as opposed to a loss , " said rep. dave reed of indiana , chairman of the republican policy committee .	democrats failed in seeking changes to the bill that would have included " unitary combined reporting " for businesses , which rep. phyllis mundy , d-luzerne , called " the most comprehensive approach to closing the delaware loophole and many other loopholes . "	mundy said the reed-sponsored bill would cost the state $ 2.7 billion over eight years , a figure reed said had been " brought out of thin air .

angry farmers brought two cows to tokyo , shouting and punching the air tuesday in a protest to demand compensation for products contaminated by radiation spewing from japan 's crippled nuclear plant .	the 200 farmers , mostly from northeastern japan , wore green bandanas , held aloft cabbages they said they could n't sell and carried signs saying " stop nuclear energy " outside the headquarters of tokyo electric power co. , the operator of the plant damaged in the march 11 tsunami . "	my patience has run out .	the nuclear crisis is totally destroying our farming business , " said 72-year-old katsuo okazaki , who grows peaches and apples .	radiation leaking from fukushima dai-ichi plant ?	about 140 miles ( 220 kilometers ) north of tokyo ?	has been found in milk , water and vegetables such as spinach from around the plant .	authorities have banned the sale of raw milk from some towns near the plant , as well as spinach , cabbage , broccoli and several other leafy vegetables from throughout fukushima prefecture , though most restrictions in nearby prefectures have been lifted .	but even once restrictions are removed and produce is deemed safe , farmers throughout the northeast fear consumers will shun their products .	the utility says it will take six to nine months to bring the plant into cold shutdown , a crucial step for allowing the roughly 80,000 people evacuated from a 12-mile ( 20-kilometer ) area around the plant to return home .	farmers among the evacuees also are concerned about the estimated 3,000 cows , 130,000 pigs and 680,000 chickens they had to leave behind to fend for themselves .	some have died already , and many are weak and dying . "	i 'm here in protest , and to get an apology , " said masaki yoshizawa , who had 300 head of high-grade " wagyu " cattle on a ranch about 9 miles ( 14 kilometers ) from the plant .	tepco will start depositing initial compensation payments of 1 million yen ( $ 12,000 ) per household on tuesday into bank accounts of people forced to evacuate due to leaking radiation , trade minister banri kaieda said .	okazaki , the fruit farmer , is n't eligible because his farm is 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) from the plant , but he still wants compensation , fearing a lengthy slump in demand for farm products from his region .	he says vegetable growers already have lost a great deal of money . "	i am constantly worried about this , and feel like my strength is being sapped away , " he said .	farmers , who brought the cows to highlight the milk ban and plight of animals left behind in the evacuation zone , took turns shouting their frustrations into a microphone , their words carried over a loudspeaker mounted atop a van , as lunch-hour passers-by in the busy office district stopped and gawked at the animals in the back of two trucks . "	we have no dreams .	no hope .	each day , i ask myself ' how do i live ? "	shouted kazuhiko suzuki , 70 , from fukushima . "	tepco , give us back our cows and pigs and chickens , " yelled another farmer .	meanwhile , fukushima authorities sent six veterinarians tuesday into the evacuation zone to survey livestock there .	with no time for burials , veterinarians will spray lime over any dead animals to prevent them from spreading disease , agricultural officials said .	dying or weakened animals will be euthanized only after getting the owners ' permission , but that could prove difficult , because they are scattered in evacuation centers .	in another setback at the nuclear plant , workers detected water leaking from the containment vessel of unit 1 , said hidehiko nishiyama , a spokesman for the nuclear and industrial safety agency .	tepco spokesman junichi matsumoto said a pair of robots sent in to investigate found no major leak , but nishiyama said further investigation was needed .	the development raised questions about an emerging plan to fill the containment vessel , a huge chamber shaped like an upside-down light bulb , with water to cool the reactor core inside .	some water already has accumulated there after being pumped into the reactor core to cool fuel rods .	engineers must assess whether the vessel would remain structurally sound if filled or become vulnerable to additional earthquakes .	marking the 25th anniversary of the chernobyl nuclear accident , hundreds of protesters with candles burning in white paper cups filled the plaza outside tepco headquarters tuesday evening , chanting , " nuclear power is not necessary .	let 's stop nuclear power .

the high court upheld lower rulings and rejected citibank 's argument that it should be able to request the refund outside the time limit because it said state rules carve out a limited exception to the statute of limitations .	the case goes back to a 2012 claim from citibank for a $ 30 million refund for state bank taxes paid between 1999 and 2002 .	the internal revenue service in 2012 reduced citibank 's taxable income for the earlier period , which lowered the state bank franchise tax payment since that is based on federal taxable income .	south dakota 's department of revenue rejected citibank 's claim , and the state has argued that the firm did n't request a refund until after the three-year statute of limitations passed .	citibank has argued that it complied with state regulations and filed a timely refund request after the federal tax agency finished its review of the financial group 's books , when it learned its final tax outcome .	the department of revenue told the justices during oral arguments that citibank should have asked for the refund within the statute of limitations -- even though the federal audit was n't finished -- in order to comply with state law .	a circuit court judge had dismissed the bank 's appeal of an administrative appeal in 2013 before citibank brought the case to the high court .	citibank and gov. dennis daugaard 's office did n't immediately comment .

"	i have been writing it in different ways and forms almost all of my life . "	she recalled the introductory line of an essay she wrote for high school english , which asked , " do americans think , when they shake the hand of someone with mental illness , that it 's contagious ? "	the book opens during kufahl 's early childhood , before her sister 's illness .	her recollections , full of immediate , concrete sensory images reflect a child 's sense of awe at the simplest things : the mystery of a mouse skeleton , the fantastical world of the neighbor 's hayloft , her sense of pride tied with her uncle 's role as church pastor , her father 's role of church caretaker ( custodian ) and her mother 's role as church organist .	she writes of living in poverty and yet feeling rich in nature , experience and family ties .	the first whispers of unease come through as gail , 13 years older , confides in her younger sister during visits home . "	faye , do you hear that ? "	gail would ask , attentive to voices that existed inside her mind .	the turning point for gail came when she returned home for a thanksgiving visit ?	a joyful tradition for the kufahls every year when their modest home filled with up to 50 guests and decorations galore .	seated at the thanksgiving table with everyone around her , gail , directed by voices unseen , picked up the carving knife and headed toward faye .	other hands stopped her , but no one spoke .	the dinner was over , and so was gail 's normal life .	she lived the next few decades at winnebago state hospital , heavily medicated , behind locked doors .	with the reagan administration , the pendulum swung the other way , and gail , along with so many other mentally ill innocents , as kufahl terms them , were released to live independently .	for most , that translated to a life on the streets , and , indeed , gail became a bag lady .	she re-entered faye 's life when she showed up on her little sister 's doorstep , unwashed , reeking of urine , high on drugs , her toenails uncut and curled beneath her feet .	faye took gail in for a year , doing her best to turn things around for her sister .	treatment and detox programs failed to work miracles , but faye did provide one essential ?	love . "	she died in 2007 in my arms , " kufahl said , relating the story of gail 's death years later of gangrene . "	i thought i had been a failure .	but eventually , i realized that i had done something good .	after living with me , she never returned to the streets . "	kufahl said that she now considers it a great gift to have been able to be with her sister as she died , to hold her older sister in her arms and sing to her as she slipped away .	the second part of " nutterville " explores what kufahl did with the foundation that gail gave her .	mental illness was not as well understood in the early 1960s , so after her sister 's diagnosis , the entire kufahl family came under suspicion locally as having done something to cause it .	this isolated faye further in her home community , but she was ostracized even further when she was sent to the next town to a christian high school rather than traveling to the area public school with her neighbors .	it took kufahl a long time to come into her own , and she relates some failures over the years , including marriage to a mentally ill man who ultimately sent her to a women 's shelter .	yet all along , kufahl 's early foundation strengthened her , along with the support she received from others .	she discovered where her talents lay , and she used them to help others .	in the past , she has worked with many people with some degree of mental illness , and has welcomed them into her home as they have welcomed her into theirs .	she described a previous job in which she worked for an older woman who used a wheelchair and " heard " ghosts dancing upstairs in her empty house .	the woman was n't troubled by these ghosts - even though she did send kufahl upstairs repeatedly to check if anything had been disturbed .	rather , they served to liven up her confined existence . "	she could hear ballroom dancing , and the rustle of the great ballroom skirts as they passed . "	kufahl said . "	i saw no point in alerting her son ( kufahl 's employer at the time ) .	she was enjoying herself . "	kufahl said she does not know if this woman , who was old at the time , is still living , but she likes to think that one night she might have slipped the bonds of her mortal life and swished away upstairs to join the dance .

a federal judge just two months before election day has ordered that wisconsin election officials not enforce the law limiting how much money candidates can collect from political action committees .	u.s. district judge rudolph randa on friday issued the ruling in a lawsuit brought by the crg network , a political action committee that works to elect conservative candidates .	the group argued that the limits were a violation of its free speech rights .	randa , in granting a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law , said the group was likely to succeed on that claim .	dana brueck , spokeswoman for the department of justice , which was representing the government accountability board in defending the law , had no comment .	randa stopped enforcement of the law as it applies to all candidates for state office , rejecting arguments from the state government accountability board , which enforces election law , that crg network did n't have standing to challenge it other than for candidates to the state assembly .	crg network said in its lawsuit that it tried to make donations of $ 250 to four republican candidates for the state assembly .	only one of them , rep. dan knodl , of germantown , accepted the donation , while the other three returned all or a portion of the money because they had already met their pac donation limits .	wisconsin 's campaign finance laws set those limits at $ 7,763 for assembly candidates , $ 15,525 for state senate candidates , $ 242,550 for the attorney general and $ 485,190 for the governor .	under state law , pacs are also limited from making single donations no larger than $ 500 for member of the state assembly , $ 1,000 for the senate , $ 21,560 for attorney general and $ 43,128 for governor .	crg network was represented in the lawsuit by the wisconsin institute for law & liberty .	the group 's attorney , rick esenberg , said in a statement that he was hopeful the legislature would completely revamp the state 's campaign finance laws in light of " the string of recent legal defeats .

a chastened president barack obama signaled a willingness to compromise with republicans on tax cuts and energy policy wednesday , one day after his party lost control of the house and suffered deep senate losses in midterm elections .	obama ruefully called the republican victories " a shellacking " and acknowledged that his own connection with the public had frayed .	at a white house news conference , the president said that when congress returns , " my goal is to make sure we do n't have a huge spike in taxes for middle class families . "	he made no mention of his campaign-long insistence that tax cuts be permitted to expire on upper-income families , a position he said would avoid swelling the deficit but put him in conflict with republicans .	he also virtually abandoned his legislation ?	hopelessly stalled in the senate ?	featuring economic incentives to reduce carbon emissions from power plants , vehicles and other sources . "	i 'm going to be looking for other means of addressing this problem , " he said . "	cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat , " he said , strongly implying there will be others .	in the campaign , republicans slammed the bill as a " national energy tax " and jobs killer , and numerous democrats sought to emphasize their opposition to the measure during their own re-election races .	the president opened his post-election news conference by saying voters who felt frustrated by the sluggish pace of economic recovery had dictated the republican takeover in the house .	asked to reflect on the returns , he said , " i feel bad , " adding that many democrats who went down to defeat had done so knowing they risked their careers to support his agenda of economic stimulus legislation and a landmark health care bill .	he blamed himself , in part . "	the relationship that i 've had with the american people is one that built slowly , peaked at this incredible high , and then during the course of the last two years , as we 've together gone through some very difficult times , has gotten rockier and tougher , " obama said .	criticized at times for appearing detached and aloof , obama spoke about the challenges he 's faced in engaging the american people from the often insular white house . "	when i 'm out of this place , that 's not an issue , " obama said . "	when you 're in this place , it is hard not to seem removed . "	obama also acknowledged that he must repair his relationship with private sector leaders who view him as anti-business , saying that the relationship is one that " has not been managed by me as well " as it should have been .	the president said he was eager to sit down with the leaders of both political parties " and figure out how we can move forward together . " "	it wo n't be easy , " he said , noting the two parties differ profoundly in some key areas .	on one controversial issue , the president said he saw a possibility that congress might agree to overturn the military 's ban on openly gay service members when lawmakers return to the capitol for a post-election session later this month .	the election was a humbling episode for the once-high-flying president , and the change showed during his news conference .	largely absent were his smiles and buoyant demeanor , replaced by somberness and an acknowledgment that his policies may have alienated some americans . "	i think people started looking at all this , and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people 's lives than they were accustomed to , " he conceded .	but he was n't talking surrender either .	he sought to tread a careful line , suggesting he would cooperate with republicans where it was possible and confront them when it was not . "	no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here , " he said , a clear warning to republicans that he wo n't simply bow to their demands for a sharply conservative switch in economic policy .	with his comments , obama largely followed the lead of republican leaders who said earlier in the day they were willing to compromise ?	within limits .	with unemployment at 9.6 percent , both the president and the republicans will be under pressure to compromise .	yet neither must lose faith with core supporters ?	the republicans with the tea party activists who helped them win power , obama with the voters whose support he will need in 2012 .	the president said the economy had begun a recovery since he took office but americans became wary when they saw government bailouts of failing banks and two of the big three u.s. automakers .	many republicans campaigned by calling for repeal of the health care legislation obama won from congress , but the president said repeal was a nonstarter . "	if republicans have some ideas " for cutting costs of health care or making other changes in the bill , he said he would be glad to take a look . "	there are going to be some examples of where we can tweak and make progress , " he said . "	but i do n't think if you ask the american people , ' should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole that helps seniors get prescription drugs , should we go back to where people with pre-existing conditions ca n't get health insurance ' ... i do n't think you 'd have a strong vote from people saying , ' those are provisions i want to eliminate . ' "	famously unemotional in public , obama was asked whether he needs to change his leadership style , and he responded : " when you 're in this place , it is hard not to seem removed . "	he said he needs to do more " to ensure i 'm getting out of here . "	he also pointed out that " a couple of great communicators " ?	reagan and clinton ?	also stood at the podium two years into their presidencies " getting very similar questions . "	actually , clinton 's electoral comeuppance was worse .	republicans won both the house and senate at his first midterm , but he recovered to win re-election two years later .	republicans lost seats in congress at reagan 's first midterm election in 1982 but never had a house majority to lose , and kept control of the senate for four more years .

"	this is not a typical storm , " corbett said sunday .

a new report says kentucky 's prevailing wage law increases labor costs by as much as 51 percent for some public projects .	the legislative research commission said a study of 12 public school projects increased labor costs by about $ 600,000 .	a study of 17 state government projects found the prevailing wage law increased labor costs by 6.7 percent .	democrats said the report was flawed because it did not look at whether the prevailing wage law increased the total cost of construction projects .	they argued paying workers higher wages lowers overall construction costs by increasing productivity .	a panel of state lawmakers decided not to adopt the report after a two-hour meeting that featured some heated exchanges .	republicans have generally favored repealing the prevailing wage law while democrats usually support it .

thirty years ago , a vote like the one just decided in this university town would n't have happened ; gay-rights activism had n't taken root across most of america .	thirty years from now , such votes may seem a historical curiosity in a time of equality for gays .	right now , though , the gay rights movement is at a tipping point , as epitomized by bowling green 's divisive referendum on extending local anti-discrimination protections to gays in areas such as housing and employment .	the vote was so close that it took three extra weeks to determine whether the two measures passed .	nationally , gay-rights supporters and their conservative opponents are trading victories and setbacks , and the public is deeply divided on same-sex marriage .	could the push for full equality be stalled or reversed ?	probably not , if public opinion evolves at its current pace . "	all you have to do is look at the demographics and you can see this is as inevitable as anything , " said michael klarman , a harvard law school professor who has studied the civil rights and gay rights movements .	surveys repeatedly find that young adults , far more so than their elders , support the rights of gays to marry and serve openly in the military .	a gallup poll earlier this year showed , for the first time , a majority of americans saying same-sex relations were morally acceptable .	increasing numbers of americans personally know gays and lesbians , and positive portrayals of them abound on tv and in films . "	the more gay-friendly an environment you create , the more people come out as gay , " klarman said . "	when people know other people are gay ?	family , co-workers ?	they find it harder and harder to dislike them and deny them equal rights . "	social conservatives see those trends as clearly as liberals do , though they may hope for a different outcome . "	there is a sense of inevitability of moral standards diminishing that is frustrating for many , " said the rev. scott estep , pastor of a popular bowling green church , dayspring assembly of god .	the church of 700-plus members , on the dixie highway north of town where roadside businesses give way to open farmland , is attended by leading opponents of the two ordinances , though the pastor himself made no formal endorsement of either side . "	i 'm concerned about the kind of environment my children will grow up in , " said estep , who considers homosexual behavior one sin among many .	he suggested , not despairingly , that his son and daughter " will be faced with a lot more decisions and diversity than i did . "	both sides in the bowling green campaign recognized that they were part of a bigger picture , evidenced by the involvement of national gay-rights organizers whose savvy , in the end , helped the local ordinances win approval after a bitter 16-month debate . "	we became a small battleground in a larger war , " said john zanfardino , the city councilor who introduced the ordinances in 2009 , miscalculating that their enactment would be swift and smooth .	the battleground is a northwest ohio town of 30,000 residents , plus 18,000 university students .	its county was carried by george w. bush in the 2004 presidential election and by barack obama in 2008 .	mayor john quinn is already talking about the need to heal the wounds opened by the referendum campaign . "	some of it was n't as pretty as i 'd have liked , " he said . "	i do n't want to use the word hate , but some people have very strong anti-gay feelings . "	to local conservatives managing the no campaign , the ordinances were an unneeded gesture of political correctness in a community where , in their view , blatant discrimination had n't been a problem .	they said the ultimate goal was to undermine ohio 's 2004 ban on same-sex marriage ?	part of surge of similar bans in other states ?	as a step toward legalizing gay marriage nationwide . "	it 's about trying to impose on our community a political agenda , " said real estate agent ed sitter , who was active in the no campaign . "	the militant homosexuals want their lifestyle elevated to the same level as the civil rights movement . "	though he and his allies resented the role of outside organizers on the yes side , sitter views their town-by-town strategy as formidable . "	they 're looking 15-20 years ahead , " he said . "	they 're more committed to their cause than we are . "

the highest court in massachusetts has reversed the murder conviction of a former new york banking executive who was accused of fatally stabbing his former girlfriend on the exclusive island of nantucket in 2004 .	the supreme judicial court said in its decision released on tuesday that there were flaws in the way the jury for the trial of thomas toolan iii was selected , especially since nantucket is such an insular community toolan , a former citigroup executive , was convicted of killing elizabeth lochtefeld on 2007 .	the court ruled that many of the people in the jury pool had either direct ties to the victim 's family , or close ties to potential witnesses in the case .	the slaying was the first on nantucket in more than two decades .	the sjc has ordered a new trial .

united on almost nothing , barack obama and john boehner are the two faces of america 's divided government ?	the humbled president and the triumphant house leader .	both claim to speak for the people , yet they have had little to say to each other .	this is the relationship that will drive everything .	on first appearance , both men on wednesday pledged to cooperate to create jobs .	that was the key issue in tuesday 's election .	a reflective obama acknowledged the drubbing his party took ; boehner , the speaker-in-waiting , seemed intent not to gloat .	yet the clearer reality is that these are men of vastly different agendas , styles and backgrounds .	and it was telling that just about every mention of cooperation between them was accompanied by insistence on more give by the other ?	essentially the same formula for bitter gridlock that existed before voters tilted power toward republicans . "	the new majority here in congress will be the voice of the american people , " declared boehner , whose mission includes undoing obama 's signature health care law .	obama offered an opposite analysis , saying any mandate to debate and vote again on the issues of the past two years would be " misreading the election . "	these are men who simply see solutions to problems differently , and they do n't communicate with each other very well .	that 's how boehner bluntly put it before the election , and the white house does not dispute the feeling .	boehner is a backslapper with a sarcastic wit and a penchant for getting worked up , often choking up during floor speeches or losing his temper altogether .	obama is the ivy league-educated law professor who is known for keeping his composure and publicly yielding few flashes of anger .	boehner was a prime obama target during the lead-up to the midterm elections , with the president criticizing the ohio congressman by name and setting him up as the embodiment of unwise republican ideas , past and future .	the white house went so far as to choose cleveland as the site of an early september speech on the economy because boehner had delivered an economic address in the same city two weeks prior .	the president called out boehner eight times .	and the two men have been involved in some bitter face-to-face exchanges , such as a classic white house meeting in 2008 about the financial bailout .	boehner bluntly aired the house republicans ' growing concerns over the plan , while obama ?	then a presidential candidate ?	said some lawmakers simply did n't understand the urgency of the situation , something republicans interpreted as a swipe at them .	obama did call to congratulate boehner tuesday night , but he made only a vague reference to looking forward to working together and to meeting in the next few weeks .	on thursday , obama told reporters at the white house after a cabinet meeting that he has invited boehner and top senate republican mitch mcconnell to meet with him on nov. 18 .	the meeting is also to include current house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid .	the president said he wants the bipartisan meeting to be a substantive discussion on the economy , tax cuts and unemployment insurance .	he also wants the senate to pass a nuclear-arms treaty with russia during an upcoming lame-duck session .	republicans regard obama as haughty and unwilling to engage ; boehner himself accused the president earlier this year of offering " finger-wagging lectures " instead of leadership .	and obama and boehner are not believed to have ever met one-on-one , with their dealings conducted in group meetings or through senior aides .
a delaware hospital has revealed that it investigated a 1996 complaint against a pediatrician now accused of molesting more than 100 patients , but the doctor was cleared of any wrongdoing .	a nurse reported in 1996 that dr. earl bradley may have inappropriately touched young girls in his care .	officials at beebe medical center said after bradley 's december arrest that they were not aware of any past problems with him .	they have since acknowledged that bradley was investigated by milford police in 2005 , but no charges were filed .	officials said in a statement that they were revealing the 1996 complaint now because they could do so " without jeopardizing the criminal case . "	police and prosecutors found out about the 1996 investigation after they charged him in december .	bradley faces 471 criminal counts including rape , sexual exploitation of a child and continuous sexual abuse of a child .	authorities say he videotaped the assaults of his patients , including infants and toddlers , some of whom screamed or tried to get away .	the recordings date back to 1998 .	beebe ceo jeffrey m. fried said he regrets not being able to stop bradley in 1996 . "	once you know what happened , you see what a diabolical person he was , " fried said . "	it makes your stomach turn . "	the 1996 complaint came from a nurse who worked with bradley .	she raised several concerns , chiefly about his practice of using a catheter to obtain urine samples from young girls .	the nurse questioned why bradley needed girls to undress before an exam and the way he positioned girls while he examined their genitals .	she was also concerned about his kissing and hugging of patients .	the complaint eventually reached fried , who has been beebe 's ceo since 1995 .	he said he considered it a " clinical " concern and not a complaint of a sexual nature .	an internal investigation concluded there was nothing unusual about bradley 's clinical practices , and while fried said bradley 's hugging and kissing of patients was " quirky , " the hospital did not consider it to be a violation of policy .	bradley was not disciplined .	chase t. brockstedt , an attorney who represents one alleged victim 's family , said beebe missed a golden opportunity to stop bradley . "	think of all the children who would have been spared , " brockstedt said .	fried also told the news journal of wilmington that the hospital did not disclose the 1996 complaint during the 2005 investigation into allegations of patient abuse by bradley , which ended without any charges being filed .	the hospital had received a subpoena seeking any complaints and disciplinary actions against bradley .	but hospital officials were not obligated to report the complaint because bradley was cleared after an internal review , fried said , adding that the hospital believed police were pursuing a case related to bradley 's financial troubles .	in a statement , beebe said there " has never been any attempt to hide bradley 's behavior .	there was simply no reason to do so , nor would anyone at beebe medical center protect a doctor , or anyone , at the expense of the children in our community .	remember that members of our staff and physician community continued to use bradley to treat their children and grandchildren until publicly informed of his abuse . "	bradley is being held in lieu of $ 4.7 million bail .	a status conference in the case is scheduled for may 17 .

investigators on wednesday were still trying to determine the cause of a riverside stampede that left nearly 400 people dead as thousands of cambodians lit candles and made offerings to appease the souls of those who perished .	the mass deaths occurred monday night as tens of thousands of panicked people tried to flee an island in the bassac river across a narrow bridge during a traditional festival .	what sparked the hysteric surge is unclear .	witnesses , however , have criticized authorities for causing congestion by blocking a second bridge across the river despite the huge crowds that had gathered for the festival , and for a slow and confused emergency response after the disaster .	officials say 378 people were killed and at least 755 others injured .	prime minister hun sen has described the stampede on koh pich ?	diamond island ?	as the biggest tragedy since the communist khmer rouge 's reign of terror , which left an estimated 1.7 million people dead in the late 1970s .	he has declared a day of national mourning on thursday .	on tuesday night , tens of thousands of residents across the capital phnom penh carried out rituals at their homes to appease the victims ' souls .	one woman said that people believed that after a tragedy on such a scale the souls of the dead would gather in the city and may wreak harm if not properly appeased .

france 's justice minister went before parliament tuesday to defend a hotly debated bill that would ban burqa-style islamic veils in public , arguing that hiding your face from your neighbors is a violation of french values .	michele alliot-marie 's speech at the national assembly marked the start of parliamentary debate on the bill .	it is widely expected to become law , despite the concerns of many french muslims , who fear it will stigmatize them .	many law scholars also argue it would violate the constitution .	the government has used various strategies to sell the proposal , casting it at times as a way to promote equality between the sexes , to protect oppressed women or to ensure security in public places .	alliot-marie argued that it has nothing to do with religion or security ?	she argued simply that life in the french republic " is carried out with a bare face . " "	it is a question of dignity , equality and transparency , " she said in a speech that avoided mentioning the words " burqa " or " islam . "	officials have taken pains to craft language that does not single out muslims : while the proposed legislation is colloquially referred to as the " burqa ban , " it is officially called " the bill to forbid covering one 's face in public . "	ordinary muslim headscarves are common in france , but face-covering veils are a rarity ?	the interior ministry says only 1,900 women in france wear them .	yet the planned law would be a turning point for islam in a country with a muslim population of at least 5 million people , the largest in western europe .	france is determined to protect the country 's deeply rooted secular values , and the conservative government is encouraging a moderate , state-sanctioned islam that respects the secular state .	last week prime minister francois fillon inaugurated a mosque in the paris suburbs .	lawmakers at the national assembly are expected to vote on the bill july 13 .	it goes to the senate in september .	france 's opposition socialists agree with much of the draft law , although they say a ban should n't be applicable everywhere ?	just in certain places , such as government buildings , hospitals , public transport and banks . "	we 're not going into this debate with a head-on attack , " jean-marc ayrault , who heads the socialists in the french national assembly , told associated press television news .	he said burqa-style veils " are a step backward that we want to fight . "	alliot-marie argued that the law must be applicable everywhere to be coherent ?	but she nonetheless presented a host of exceptions to the face-covering ban , such as masks worn for health reasons , for sports like fencing and at public fetes such as carnivals .	authorities in several european countries have been debating similar bans .	belgium 's lower house has enacted a ban on the face-covering veil , though it must be ratified by the upper chamber .	in france , the bill says france 's founding tenets of liberty , equality and fraternity are at stake .	the legislation would forbid face-covering muslim veils such as the niqab or burqa in all public places in france , even in the street .	it calls for ?	150 ( $ 185 ) fines or citizenship classes for women who run afoul of the law , and in some cases both .	part of the bill is aimed at husbands and fathers who impose such veils on female family members .	under the most current version of the text , anyone convicted of forcing a woman to wear such a veil risks a year of prison and a ?	30,000 fine ?	with both those penalties doubled if the victim is a minor .	france " does not accept attacks on human dignity , " alliot-marie said . "	it does not tolerate the abuse of vulnerable people . "	said aalla , president of a mosque in the eastern city of strasbourg , said he believes legislators have the right to pass laws on societal issues .	but like many french muslims , he is concerned about how police will enforce it . "	is this a law that is going to be implemented in a serene way , so as not to stigmatize the muslim population ? "	he asked .	amnesty international has urged french lawmakers to reject the bill , and a french anti-racism group , mrap , which opposes such dress , has said a law would be " useless and dangerous . "	france 's highest administrative body , the council of state , warned in march that a total ban risks being found unconstitutional .	france banned common muslim headscarves and other obvious religious symbols from classrooms in 2004 .	associated press writer rafael mesquita and aptn senior producer jeffrey schaeffer in paris contributed to this report .

the smithsonian 's vast collection of 137 million objects can come in handy at a time like this .	scientists are beginning to determine the full impact of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico and help guide its recovery .	and they will need to know about all the creatures that lived in the water before the oil began gushing ?	from the commercial shrimp to rarely seen giant squid and microorganisms .	that 's where the smithsonian comes in .	the museum and research complex in washington holds the most complete set of invertebrate species that live in the gulf of mexico .	the collection will serve as the scientific starting point for what lived there before the spill to measure the unseen impact , said jonathan coddington , head of research and collections at the national museum of natural history . "	everybody and their brother is going to be going out to the gulf and measuring stuff , " coddington said . "	a lot of the controversy is going to be about what the impact of the spill was . "	this collection will be the baseline to determine that , he said , surrounded by thousands of jars containing worms and other gulf creatures preserved in alcohol in a suburban maryland warehouse .	the collection includes more than 333,000 containers of invertebrates collected in the gulf by the u.s. minerals management service over the past 30 years .	another 39,000 jars are partially inventoried , though as many as 120,000 more have n't been inventoried .	the spill , unleashed after a drilling rig leased by bp plc exploded april 20 , has made the backlog an urgent priority , coddington said .	it could cost $ 9 million to catch up all of the smithsonian 's uncatalogued objects , he recently told a house panel .	the mms conducted environmental surveys of the waters for years , specifically to help predict the impact of future gas and oil explorations .	they began turning over the extensive collection to the smithsonian for cataloging and safekeeping in 1979 .	overall , the collection documents at least 4,000 marine invertebrate species .	recent studies have shown the gulf contains roughly 15,000 species overall and perhaps another 3,000 species still undiscovered .	on wednesday , smithsonian secretary wayne clough will testify before a house science panel about the smithsonian 's resources and research agenda .	he has said the gulf coast invertebrates are a prime example of how useful the collections are .	the most recent addition from the gulf arrived last year , and it 's a research project in itself .	a 26-foot-long giant squid housed in a large metal coffin and floating in alcohol was caught alive last year , which is rare .	usually such squid are found floating dead on the ocean surface and already rotting , said collections manager cheryl bright .	so the recent catch gave scientists a glimpse at the squid 's body chemistry , stomach contents and other data .	all that information can be compared to creatures found after the oil spill .	smithsonian scientists began putting the collection to use just days after the oil spill , creating a digital map showing where each specimen was collected from more than 5,700 sites in the gulf .	it turns out some animals had been collected near the spill site .	one spot within 20 miles of the deepwater horizon well , for example , is home to a deepwater coral that is a key reef-building species , making it fundamental to other marine life .	if that base of the ecosystem is harmed , the domino effect on other species could be devastating .	other gulf invertebrates and organisms serve as food for shrimp and birds that humans see more often .	so information from the collection could help settle conflicts about what the bp spill is responsible for . "	shrimpers are going to say , ' we 're just not seeing any big shrimp any longer . '	then we 'll go back to these collections and say the average size of shrimp prior to the spill was this , " coddington said . "	it will come out which ever way it comes out .	facts help everybody .

in the last two decembers in the district of columbia and northern virginia , federal authorities have noticed that bank robberies have boomed .	a quarter of all bank robberies in the region occurred in the month of december the past two years , the fbi 's washington field office found .	investigators saw a similar trend the three years before that , though not as high as 2012 and 2013 .	last december , there were 17 bank robberies in the district and northern virginia , or 24 percent of the 73 committed in the region the entire year .	four of last year 's 17 december robberies remain unsolved .	investigators believe the trend can be partially attributed to people who want extra cash during the holidays , fbi spokeswoman lindsay ram said friday . "	bank robbery is a desperate crime , and the holiday season sometimes represents a desperate time of year for people , " ram said . "	they 're just wanting and needing money , whether it 's buying presents or it 's the end of the year and rent is due , or if they have bills to pay off . "	the fbi has teamed up with local police to counteract december bank robberies , including sharing information with banks and the public about the trend , putting more marked police cars outside banks , and helping security directors beef up security .	among the solved bank robberies from last december include one in arlington by a crew of three men who had robbed three other banks in the region in three-month period .	the men were arrested dec. 31 moments after robbing the arlington bank .	one of the men had been waiting in a getaway car , while the other two had gone inside , ordered everyone on the floor at gunpoint and took cash from the tellers , ram said .	one of the men , alphonso stoddard of forest heights , maryland , is now serving three life sentences , partly because of prior armed robbery convictions .	james link of washington is serving a 35-year sentence in the case , and james mcneal of hyattsville , maryland is serving 15 years .	amy thoreson , an fbi spokeswoman for the baltimore field office , said maryland has seen some december spikes but not like the washington area .	that state 's busiest month for bank robberies last year was september , she said .

thousands of outfits later , with probably every hemline , color and silhouette turning up somewhere on the runways of new york , london , milan and paris , fashion insiders have started to focus on trends they think will have the most influence on style in the second half of the year .	there was a wearability to many of the clothes paraded in front of retailers , editors and stylists , which might not have made the most exciting show seasons , but could translate into solid sales . "	designers are understanding that women do n't dress in gowns , " says brandon holley , editor-in-chief of lucky magazine . "	it was all about pieces you could work with .	now the question is , what can you break down and put into your wardrobe ? "	colleen sherin , senior fashion director at saks fifth avenue , says the " big idea " that stuck with her throughout the previews was one of eclectic elegance .	it 's a more democratic style that more women will be able to participate in , she notes , because it 's not about a single must-have piece , it 's about creating an overall look that can be achieved with the individual pieces that best suit your body and life .	five trends that were strong in the four big fashion capitals : layered separates , interesting fabrics , coats , military and melancholy . ?	layered separates : forget the simple dress and be ready to add a few extra minutes to your morning routine to put together your outfit , says linda wells , allure magazine editor-in-chief .	if you like the long-sleeve sheath dress , then think about how it will look with a vest or jacket on top .	if you like more of the a-line dress shape , start gathering chunky knit cardigans and blanket coats . "	this is going to be a complicated way to dress , " wells says . "	it 's very interesting , but it 's not about running out the door in one great dress , and your coat is not just a coat , but it 's a coat with a cape over it , maybe a coat with a vest , a coat with a detachable fur ?	and a turtleneck . "	underneath all the layers were some wearable pants and trousers that , lucky 's holley predicts , will be popular .	shoppers have already shown interest in all the colored pants that have emerged as an early trend for spring . "	a lot of the pants are menswear-inspired .	it 's not ' menswear ' but it has the feeling of being separate pieces with a businesslike vibe , " holley said . ?	interesting fabrics : rich luxe fabrics in rich luxe colors such as burgundy , bottle green and teal mean a stepped-up sophistication for clothes without blingy bells and whistles .	envision brocades , jacquards and metallic tweeds . "	the gorgeous colors are flattering for so many women , and they look great in the decorative fabrications and translate into outerwear , another important trend , " says saks ' sherin .	and , she says , get some leather , especially if it 's a mixed-media coat , perhaps leather sleeves on a cashmere coat , or panels of leather on a shearling .	allure 's wells noted leather t-shirts , pants and dresses , too .	leather used like lace in the alexander mcqueen collection was pure art , she says .	the leather goes with the rough edge that seemed to guide many designers this season , she says . "	there 's definitely a bit of a tough look . " ?	coats : coats are a good investment piece because you get so much use out of them , holley says .	a coat is a workhorse in a way that a great dress or even great black pants can not be , she explains . "	you can wear your new coat many times and ( for ) many seasons . "	as a look , she favored the trench coat silhouette with a pair of slim-fit pants and a beautiful flat shoe .	sherin says shoppers will have other options , ranging from peacoats and duffels to sporty , puffy jackets .	there were fancy embellished coats and even those with gilded embroidery at dolce & gabbana . "	statement coats is something we 'll be buying into , " she says . ?	military : military touches , including epaulets , patch pockets and metallic hardware , were consistent , although there was not a literal translation of camo and khaki , says amanda brooks , who attended shows as fashion director for barneys new york .	( she announced her resignation from the post this week . )	there was a sort of yin and yang with the strength that comes from straightforward military styles that was balanced by those elegant ?	and expensive ?	fabrics . "	a simple item with a high price will be harder to sell than a simple item in high fabrics that look expensive , " brooks says , noting specifically marni 's military pockets on fur shrugs . ?	melancholy : there was an overall darkness to the collections , from the palette to the mood , says wells .	there were important flashes of embellishment that added some levity and whimsy , but wells pictured a muse in the spirit of leo tolstoy 's anna karenina . "	it was all about the romance of the ill-fated lover .	... it was not a sad statement , but a poetic , romantic sad with indulgence . "	cuts of clothes were sometimes severe and had a seriousness in the details .	it was not quite goth , wells says , but almost .	that vibe played into the covered-up sensuality that also cast its spell over the catwalks , sherin adds .	instead of plunging vs , there were high necklines , for example , but strategic use of sheer fabrics kept it all very modern , she explains . "	it was revealing and concealing at the same time . "	the beauty is in the choices , holley says . "	there was n't a single breakout look that changed everything , but what the season did better than i 've ever seen before is show wearable pieces .	we do n't need theater , we need clothes we can wear . "

tiffany & co. cut its outlook for both sales and profit for the year , citing a slowdown in demand for its jewelry not only in the u.s. but in many other countries .	the downbeat outlook delivered thursday came as the luxury chain reported that its profit for the first quarter was essentially the same as a year ago , hurt by business at home .	tiffany is considered a key barometer of health for the luxury consumer , so its report raises concerns that weakness in the stock market and an accelerating debt crisis in europe are making shoppers pull back in spending .	tiffany said that its net income amounted to $ 81.5 million , or 64 cents per share in the quarter ended april 30 .	that compares with $ 81.1 million , or 63 cents per share , a year ago .	worldwide revenue rose almost 8 percent to $ 819.2 million in the quarter .	revenue at stores opened at least a year was up 4 percent .	the measure is an indicator of a retailer 's health .	analysts had expected 69 cents per share on revenue of $ 817.1 million .	the company said that sales in the americas region , which include the u.s. , canada and latin america , rose 3 percent to $ 386 million .	and sales in europe rose a 3 percent to $ 88 million .	sales in the asia-pacific region rose 17 percent to $ 195 million , while sales in japan soared 15 percent to $ 142 million .	tiffany said that it now expects earnings per share to be in the range of $ 3.70 per share to $ 3.80 per share for the year .	it had originally expected $ 3.95 per share to $ 4.05 per share .	analysts had projected $ 3.98 per share , according to factset .	tiffany also says that it now anticipates worldwide sales to be up 7 percent to 8 percent , instead of the originally projected 10 percent .	its shares fell $ 5.05 , or 8.2 percent , to $ 56.75 per share in premarket trading .

"	we have been looking for a bill like this for some time .

katrina clark and lindsay greenawalt have much in common .	bright women in their 20s , raised by single mothers , keenly curious about the men whose donated sperm helped give them life .	clark 's search for her father succeeded after only a month , though with a bittersweet aftermath .	greenawalt is still searching , seven years after she started ?	persisting despite doubts and frustrations . "	i 've dreamt of you since i was a little girl , " greenawalt wrote to her unknown dad in a father 's day blog posting in june . "	there are so many things i want to know about you . "	greenawalt , who lives near cleveland , and clark , a college student in washington , d.c. , are part of an increasingly outspoken generation of donor offspring .	they want to transform the dynamics of sperm donation so the children 's interests are given more weight and it becomes easier to learn about their biological fathers .	one specific goal ?	a ban on anonymous sperm donations ?	seems far-off in the united states , although britain and several other european countries have taken that step .	but the voices of donor offspring are being heard more widely and clearly than ever , thanks to internet-based social networking and other recent developments .	a new film , " the kids are all right , " depicts two teenage siblings who track down their sperm-donor father and introduce him to their lesbian moms .	complications ensue , but the teens ' yearning to meet their dad is portrayed empathetically .	the film opened just weeks after the release of a provocative study by the commission on parenthood 's future , titled " my daddy 's name is donor . "	it surveyed 485 donor offspring , concluded they were more troubled and depression-prone than other young adults in comparison groups , and recommended an end to anonymous sperm donation .	the study 's authors said they sought to ignite a debate , and they succeeded ?	reaction included swirls of pro-and-con blogosphere commentary and op-eds in several major newspapers . "	the adult voices of donor offspring are a welcome counterbalance to an array of cultural forces aimed at further marginalizing fathers , " wrote washington post columnist kathleen parker . "	at the very least , as this study implores , it is time for a serious debate on the ethics , meaning and practice of donor conception . "	an increasing number of u.s. sperm banks now offer identity-release policies , in which donors agree to let their offspring contact the donor when they turn 18 .	but many donors still opt for anonymity , producing the kind of frustrations encountered by lindsay greenawalt .	a kent state university graduate who aspires to be a medical librarian , greenawalt has been searching since 2003 for the biological dad she knows only as " xytex donor 2035 " ?	the number assigned to him in the 1980s by the xytex corp. sperm bank in augusta , ga. .	she knows the man is now 49 , attended college , and ?	like lindsay ?	has brown hair and greenish eyes .	she also knows a few medical details , thanks to an update the man recently sent to xytex after greenawalt requested it .	but learning of the medical update saddened greenawalt , because no note came with it . "	he knows i 'm looking for him ?	and he does n't want to make contact , " greenawalt said , conceding that this gave her doubts about what she 'd do if she did manage to identify him .	her lengthy search has taken a toll in other ways . "	it 's been a very sore topic with my mom ?	she felt it was a personal attack against her , that she had n't been a good parent , " greenawalt said . "	it 's none of that .	it 's something we 've got to do that 's separate from how we were raised . "	since 2008 , greenawalt , 25 , has been chronicling her quest on a blog , " confessions of a cryokid . "	one of the most wrenching entries came last thanksgiving , when she addressed the oft-repeated refrain that donor-conceived children ought to be grateful they were born . "	if i had to choose between being conceived with half of my identity and half of my kinship deliberately denied from me for eternity ?	or never being born ?	i 'd choose never being born , " she wrote . "	we were created to carry a loss .	a loss that no human being should have to endure . "	the plight of donor offspring like greenawalt deeply touches katrina clark , who surprised herself in 2006 by discovering the identity of her father on the internet after a few weeks ' research .	she sent him an e-mail and got a prompt , friendly reply , with a photograph included .	since then , however , " our communication has been pretty much nonexistent " and they have not met face-to-face , said clark , a 21-year-old student at gallaudet university who admits to being frustrated by the impasse . "	maybe i pushed or pulled too much , " clark said . "	he was n't ready to be out in the open about it .	... perhaps he was embarrassed or ashamed . "	i still wonder about him , " she added . "	there 's so much about him i still do n't know . "	at one point , clark soured on the entire idea of donor conception .	now she accepts that it can be a blessing for some families , but she favors ending donor anonymity and hopes more parents will tell the truth early on to their donor-conceived children . "	the most damaging thing i 've seen is when parents wait to tell , " she said .	in an article she wrote for the washington post in 2006 , clark described the emotions that wracked her as an adolescent . "	i realized that i am , in a sense , a freak , " she wrote . "	i finally understood what it meant to be donor-conceived , and i hated it . "	she evolved into a dedicated activist , even lobbying for an unsuccessful bill that would have made virginia the first state to ban anonymous sperm donations .	the american society for reproductive medicine , which represents many sperm banks and fertility clinics , encourages parents of donor-conceived offspring to tell their children the truth about their conception .	but it does not favor banning anonymous donations , saying the children 's rights must be balanced against the interests of donors and the parents who will raise the child . "	the bottom line in the u.s. ?	we 've always been big proponents of individual rights in regard to procreation , " said andrea braverman , who serves on the asrm 's ethics committee . "	we 've always taken the approach that we get our own choices in terms of how we build and manage our families . "	parents who want to ensure their sperm-donor offspring can learn the identity of their biological father can arrange that when they select a donor , braverman said .	a past president of the society for assisted reproductive technologies , dr. jamie grifo of new york university 's fertility center , said heavy emphasis on the rights of a child would n't always work in the realm of donor-assisted conception . "	it may not be a popular point of view , but when these decisions are made by donor and a parent , the child does n't have a say , " he said . "	if the contract is for it to be anonymous , it should remain anonymous , and the child just has to deal with that . "	grifo believes that many donor offspring who do track down their biological fathers end up unfulfilled . "	they take this on as a quest to solve all their issues , the stuff we all go through in adolescence , " he said . "	some of the reunions are good .	many are a huge disappointment . "	the " good " category would include the remarkable story of todd whitehurst , now a 44-year-old physician in new york city , who donated sperm to a california sperm bank while a graduate student at stanford university .	one of the children conceived with his sperm tracked him down in 2007 , using myspace .	whitehurst soon met with that girl , who is now 17 , and two half brothers , now 12 and 15 , all three of them raised separately by single mothers who 'd used the same sperm bank .	this suddenly connected clan has gotten along so well that they keep in steady contact and have even taken vacations together , to a pennsylvania resort , to tennessee and to disney world . "	it 's been much better than i ever imagined , " whitehurst said . "	the kids never expected anything from me ?	they just wanted to get to know me , so we 've chosen to spend more time together .	it 's viewed as a bonus , an extra great thing that happened in our lives . " "	i 'm really lucky , because all three have turned out to be nice , smart kids , " whitehurst added . "	of course , i may be biased . "	one of the mothers , cheryl shuler of butler , pa. , said meeting whitehurst has been a wonderful experience for her 15-year-old son . "	gavin always was very accepting of being donor-conceived and , if he had never met his father , i do n't think he would have been pining away for him , " shuler wrote in an e-mail . "	but it was fulfilling for him to meet , not only his dad , but the rest of todd 's family as well . "	among the bonuses , shuler wrote , was that gavin now can observe a second source of his identity , reflecting the pronounced personality differences of his two biological parents . "	todd is a city person and i am very small town .	... todd is a night owl and i am in bed by 10 p.m. , " shuler explained . "	i am glad that gavin is getting to see two different sides . "	another notable saga has unfolded in australia , where myfanwy walker met her donor dad , michael linden , in 2001 after a determined search that included going public in a newspaper article .	he read the article , contacted her , and they 've remained friends ever since despite various challenges for their families .	walker , now 29 with a husband and infant son , was told by her mother at 20 that the dad who raised her had been infertile and that she was a sperm-donor offspring .	walker 's parents had recently divorced ; the revelation added to the trauma . "	when your sense of identity and self is obliterated like that , it helps to feel you can control at least some aspects of your life , " walker said . "	searching for my father was my way of feeling like i was taking control . "	finally meeting linden , and his wife , was intense ?	lots of questions and catching up . "	all of it was so strange , abnormal and upside-down , " walker said . "	michael was a stranger to me but at the same time i felt i 'd known him my whole life . "	though grateful they connected , walker and linden have publicly criticized donor conception , saying it too often impinges on the rights of the children it produces .	at one forum , linden described himself and other sperm donors as " unwitting perpetrators of what i believe is an immense and tragic denial of the human rights of our children to know their true identity . "	in the u.s. , sperm donation is a huge business , though no official statistics are compiled .	some experts estimate there are at least 30,000 sperm-donor conceptions annually ?	perhaps many more .	more than 28,000 people involved in anonymous donations ?	offspring , parents and donors ?	have registered with the donor sibling registry , a web-based network run out of colorado by wendy kramer .	she started the registry so her donor-offspring son , ryan , could find his siblings , and she says it has helped more than 7,400 people find half-siblings and biological fathers .	kramer is part of an international network lobbying to end anonymous sperm donations and improve record-keeping so that tracking becomes easier . "	it 's always the rights of the parents , the donor , the clinic , " she said . "	why is it that the rights of donor-conceived people are n't even considered in the equation ? "
the director of the oregon liquor control commission announced his retirement tuesday after seven months on the outs with gov. john kitzhaber .	steve pharo 's announcement comes two days before the liquor commission holds its first meeting with the balance of power tipped to kitzhaber appointees .	pharo has worked at the olcc for 18 years , the last six as the director .	a kitzhaber aide asked pharo to resign earlier this year and he refused , saying he reports to the five-member liquor commission rather than the governor .	in april , when kitzhaber had appointed only two of the five commissioners , they abruptly cancelled plans to vote on firing him .	a third kitzhaber appointee , former state rep. rob patridge of medford , was confirmed by the senate last month .

native americans from across the state sang and danced in opposition to bear hunts in nevada as the aroma of burning sage filled the air outside the nevada legislature building monday .	about 50 supporters of a bill to block bear hunting in the state converged on the building to protect " bear nation . "	many native americans view the bear as a sacred animal and vehemently disapprove of the state allowing hunters to kill their " relative , " said raquel arthur , representing the pyramid lake paiute tribe . "	the bear is our elder , " arthur said . "	we consider it a very sacred animal for spiritual belief and ceremonial purposes . "	she added those ceremonies are thousands of years old . "	we must stand up for bear nation because they have no voice , " arthur said to the group of about 50 supporters .	the demonstration fell on tribal day at the 2013 nevada legislature , and comes two years after the first black bear hunts were allowed in the state in 2011 .	state wildlife biologists have said the state 's bear population is growing at a rate of about 16 percent annually and can support a limited hunt .

a prosecutor said thursday she opposes letting imprisoned ex-detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick participate in a prison boot camp that could sharply reduce his sentence .	kym worthy 's office wrote sentencing judge david groner and said that the boot camp proposal is inconsistent with the sentence of 14 months to five years .	groner , the wayne county circuit judge , has authority to decide whether kilpatrick can enter the camp , which could make kilpatrick a free man before serving his minimum sentence for probation violation .	the state corrections department said in a letter this week to wayne county circuit judge david groner that kilpatrick is eligible for the voluntary , 90-day special alternative incarceration program .	the letter asks if groner objects to kilpatrick 's move into the program and seeks a response within 30 days .	groner has the option to not acknowledge the letter , which would keep kilpatrick out of boot camp , corrections spokesman russ marlan said . "	he does n't even have to respond to the letter , " marlan said . "	he does n't even have to check any box .	we do n't typically ask again . "	kilpatrick was selected for the program after a standard intake screening for new prisoners .	groner sentenced him may 25 to up to five years in prison for violating probation in two 2008 criminal cases stemming from lies kilpatrick told under oath during a 2007 whistle-blowers ' lawsuit trial .	he served 99 days in county jail and was ordered to repay the city of detroit $ 1 million in restitution .	he wound up behind bars again last month after groner determined he failed to adequately report his assets and turn over certain financial records .	groner ruled he could be released after a minimum of 14 months .	marlan has said successful boot camp completion would bring automatic parole , something worthy has said she opposes . "	this program is not consistent with the court 's findings nor with the sentence , " worthy wrote to groner thursday . "	we object to the placement of mr. kilpatrick into the ... program and respectfully ask this court to deny the request . "	kilpatrick is imprisoned at the oaks correctional facility in manistee , about 200 miles northwest of detroit .	the boot camp would be closer to home for kilpatrick at a facility in chelsea , about 47 miles west of detroit .	to get there , a prisoner can not be serving time for crimes of a particularly violent or assaultive nature , have a history of escape , or a minimum sentence of three years or more , marlan said .	the chelsea facility is surrounded by a fence with razor wire .	prisoners are doubled-bunked to a room .	it involves a highly disciplined regimen that includes military-style exercise and work assignments .	visits and phone calls are more limited , and inmates who break rules may be removed from the program . "	it was primarily for younger males , " marlan said . "	now , there is no age restriction and there are females , too .	we get some people who are not in the best shape of their lives . "	kilpatrick , a former college football player at florida a&m , has in recent years complained of a bad knee .	part of the boot camp program involves daily two-mile runs , but that could be changed " if someone is just starting and we 're concerned about their health , " marlan said .

"	later in the war , in 1864 , boyd was sent to england as a confederate courier but captured before she could complete that mission .	historians say she later escaped and went on to marry a union naval officer and live in england until 1866 , where she worked as a stage actress .	boyd eventually returned to the u.s. and died in wisconsin in 1900 while on a lecture tour touting her adventure-filled life .	the associated press reports on aug. 2 , 1862 , that the union at this point in the war is garnering thousands of prisoners .	the ap dispatch from fortress monroe , va. , said three steamships laden with a total of 3,000 rebel prisoners had just arrived , docking outside the large union-held fortress off the virginia coast .

"	it added that " the ram arkansas approached with the intention of engaging ( federal ) gunboats , but grounded at a distance of 6 miles " from the capital city before being destroyed .	the account notes thousands of troops took part in the fighting on both sides with a large proportion of officers among at least 250 dead .	the demise of the ironclad also signals defeat for the confederacy in this attempt to regain the louisiana state capital .	meanwhile , news reports indicate union forces driven away from richmond , the confederate capital , during the seven days ' battle , have virtually evacuated the bulk of their troops , guns and supplies from harrison 's landing off the virginia peninsula region .	that fighting earlier in the summer saw rising confederate star robert e. lee repulse a massive union force at the gates of richmond , assuring that the civil war would not be ended quickly .	this week in the civil war , for week of sunday , aug. 12 : fighting in missouri , arming the armies .	fighting in the wide-ranging civil war erupted in the heartland on aug. 11 , 1862 , when confederate forces attacked independence , missouri .	the confederate fighters surprised and scattered a force of union troops garrisoned at independence .	but ultimately , the union forces that had n't been killed or immediately captured were forced to surrender .	it marked a morale-boosting victory for the secessionist government based in richmond , va. .	the fighting continued days later when a confederate force of about 3,000 men attacked more union pickets it encountered in the state on aug. 15 , 1862 .	charges and countercharges ensued as the fighting raged for hours in what was also considered a confederate victory .	however , the confederate force was obliged to withdraw from the area when a larger union force began advancing toward its position .	more fighting would follow in the weeks and months ahead in the states clustered around the mississippi river and other inland waterways deemed vital to transport and trade .	also this month 150 year ago in the war , the armies were still feverishly arming and supplying their troops with all manner of goods and materiel for what is shaping up as a drawn-out fight .	the war department , in an order published in northern newspapers , called for rush bids from leather workers to be received no later than 5 p.m. on aug. 26 , 1862 , for thousands of much-needed sets of harnesses , saddles and other cavalry equipment to be rushed to several armories around federal territory .

"	several affrays and struggles occurred between the disturbers and police , " ap reported , adding critics complained of those who sought to " sneak from duty by enrolling themselves as subjects of great britain . "	ap notes that several arrests were made .	elsewhere , reports note that a union army that waged an enormous but ultimately failed offensive to seize richmond , va. , capital of the confederacy , has fully withdrawn by aug. 16 from tidewater areas to the east .	the report said several hundred of the last troops had completed the withdrawal on ships and boats in recent days and " all is quiet .

kansas lawmakers are considering a bill that may require police officers to wear body cameras , but opponents of the proposal argue that the costs may outweigh the benefits .	the senate corrections and juvenile justice committee heard testimony thursday on legislation that would require all officers to wear body cameras and continually record their activities and interactions .	the proposal mandates that portions of the recorded footage relevant to investigations , official complaints or show the use of force would be stored for three years .	archived video could then be requested by those involved in the incidents or their attorneys .	rep. gail finney , a black democrat from wichita , testified in favor of the proposal , and said many of her minority constituents have complained of racial profiling by police .	she also fears her children and grandchildren could be victims of excessive force .

"	i think by implementing a policy such as this , it would really help ensure much more goodwill between law enforcement and the community . "	following last year 's shooting death of michael brown by a ferguson , missouri , police officer , several public figures including president barack obama have backed measures to put cameras on police officers .	several cities and counties in kansas have already equipped police with body cameras , and the wichita police department announced in december that every one of its officers would be equipped with one by the end of the year .	however , lenexa police maj. dawn layman said after the hearing that while her department has found the cameras useful , she opposed mandating them for all kansas police without providing funding and other support for the endeavor .	layman said that lenexa has spent $ 900,000 on its department 's 100 cameras and an additional $ 200,000 for the storage needed to archive the footage .	furthermore , layman said her department would have to hire at least 10 full-time employees to review the captured footage assuming officers , only recorded about two hours of footage per day .	if the officers recorded continuously , as the bill would require , then the cost of managing footage would surge to over $ 1 million , she said . "	we love our body-worn cameras , they 've been good for us , but i think i have concerns about other people getting into it and having to move towards it when this is all evolving still , " she said .	republican sen. forrest knox of altoona said after the hearing that although the cameras are " an excellent idea , " they would n't fit with many rural police departments .	he said there are over 50 towns in his district with fewer than 2,600 residents and their police departments would not have the resources to manage all of the footage they capture .

"	there is a lot of merit to the idea of extending the school year and providing students with increased instructional time , " spokesman brent ghan said .	mike wood , a lobbyist for the missouri state teachers association , said increasing the number of hours instead of the number of days might be more significant .	he said the schedules used by high-performing districts could serve as a guide .

a predominantly latino church filed a religious discrimination lawsuit against lynn city officials thursday , saying authorities have been using local ordinances to illegally prevent it from worshipping in its vacant church over the past two years in violation of federal and massachusetts constitutions .	iglesia christina renacer said in a lawsuit filed in u.s. district court in boston that lynn city officials ordered it to stop renovating the church and prevented them from worshipping there in 2009 , saying the property did n't have parking space for its potential capacity of 288 people ?	even though the church has about 84 active members .	court documents say one of the most vocal church opponents is city council president john phelan , whose home is next to the property .	he and others have argued in city council meetings and zoning board hearings that the church would hurt property values and quality of life in the neighborhood , according to court documents .	iglesia christina renacer was founded in everett in 1994 and bought the lynn property in 2009 for $ 350,950 .	the church then spent more than $ 100,000 to repair it for more than a month after receiving permits from lynn 's inspectional services department .	but the agency abruptly issued a cease-and-desist order in may 2009 that stopped all interior renovations , telling the church that it must provide at least one parking space for every three seats before it could use the property for worship and religious assembly .	that requirement would compel the church to provide 96 parking spaces for its 84 worshippers .	a different church just half a mile away has the maximum projected occupancy of more than twice that of iglesia christina renacer but has about 12 off-street parking spots , said attorney noel sterett , who represents the church .	lynn officials have rejected repeated applications for exemptions usually given in cases of hardship , sterett said . "	federal law is clear that where you have a system of exceptions and discretion , that ?	unless you have a compelling interest that you are trying to protect ?	you can not deny a religious organization a hardship exemption , " he said .	lynn city officials did n't immediately return calls for comment thursday night .	a phone call to phelan 's home rang unanswered , and he did n't immediately respond to an email seeking comment .	the lawsuit claims that lynn 's opposition to the church 's religious assembly at the anchor road property violated federal laws that protect houses of worship from discriminatory treatment . "	they want to occupy their own building , " sterett said . "	this is a property that they spent over $ 350,000 for , and they want to use it , as the zoning code permits them to , as a church . "	city hearings have caused the church to incur nearly $ 50,000 in fees for applications , lawyers , engineers and architects , sterett said .	the church also has had to pay insurance costs of nearly $ 3,800 a year and mortgage payments totaling more than $ 62,600 for a property that city officials have prevented it from using , he said .	attorneys say the church 's tithes and offerings have declined as a result of the city 's opposition to its religious assembly at the property .	the inability to use the property has also caused a substantial number of people to leave the church and its average weekly attendance has declined significantly , according to the lawsuit . "	the church has lost its momentum in ministering to the residents of lynn as a result of the city 's prohibition of its religious assembly at the church property , " according to the lawsuit .	the city has used its land ordinances in a way that violates both federal and state laws protecting places of worship " is inflicting irreparable harm to the congregations . "

floodwaters from thailand 's flood-ravaged central heartland pushed farther into bangkok on monday , as residents of long-submerged provinces north of the capital started to rebuild their lives .	the water slowly advancing through bangkok 's northern and western neighborhoods is threatening the city 's subway system , two key industrial estates and the emergency headquarters set up to deal with the flooding that has claimed more than 500 lives nationwide .	evacuations have been ordered in 12 of bangkok 's 50 districts , with residents of the northern district of klong sam wa told to leave monday .	the evacuations , which also effect parts of several other districts , are not mandatory , and many people are staying to protect homes and businesses .	but the orders illustrate how far flooding has progressed into the city and how powerless the government has been to stop it .	the flooding began in late july and some provinces to the north of bangkok have been inundated for more than a month .	the waters have started to recede in recent days , revealing the massive cleanup effort that lies ahead .	for two months , anan dirath was forced to live on the second floor of his home in nakorn sawan province .	but now that the water has receded to knee level , it 's time to clean up .	he armed his two teenage children with mops , scrub brushes and garbage bags .	wading in the water , his family began scrubbing dirt off the walls and collecting the garbage around the house .	he said the dirt was difficult to wash off and he has had to scrub the paint off to get rid of it . "	oh my pretty home .	it used to be a pretty two-story home , " he said monday .	in nearby nakorn sawan town center , where the water has dried completely , the government sponsored a cleanup day last week when roads were scrubbed down to get rid of the oily mud left from the floods .	back hoes were used to carry garbage away .	the cleanup also has begun in some parts of thailand 's ancient capital of ayutthaya .	prime minister yingluck shinawatra is to visit the province tuesday to witness recovery efforts .	yingluck says a plan to be put before the cabinet on tuesday would allocate 100 billion baht ( $ 3.3 billion ) for post-flood reconstruction .	her government has come under fire for failing to predict the threat to bangkok .	residents also have been frustrated by widely differing assessments of the flooding situation from the prime minister , bangkok 's governor and the country 's top water experts and officials .	floodwaters in the city continued to flow south monday toward the still-unaffected central business district .	in chatuchak , a few miles ( kilometers ) north of there , water was nearly knee deep around mo chit skytrain station , the northernmost stop on the capital 's elevated train system .	water was also rising near three subway stops in the same area .	both mass transit networks are functioning normally , though some exits have been barricaded and closed .	chatuchak is home to the government 's national flood relief headquarters , which is housed in the energy ministry ?	a building now surrounded by water .	the relief headquarters moved last week out of bangkok 's don muang airport after it , too , was flooded .	the city 's main airport remains open .	also in chatuchak , water has begun approaching a main road near the mo chit bus terminal , a major gateway to northern thailand .

congress is finally cleaning up its unfinished budget business for the long-underway 2013 budget year with a bipartisan government-wide funding bill , even as the combatants in the house and senate gear up for votes this week on largely symbolic measures outlining stark differences between democrats and republicans about how to fix the nation 's long-term deficit woes .	the senate is positioned to approve the catchall spending bill tuesday after it cleared a procedural hurdle monday by a strong 63-35 vote .	the house , which approved a narrower version two weeks ago , is expected to quickly clear the measure and ship it to president barack obama for his signature .	on a separate track , the republican-controlled house and democratic senate are gearing up for votes this week on sharply different budget blueprints for next year and beyond .	the dueling , non-binding blueprints veer off in opposite directions at the same time president barack obama seeks to nurture a future compromise blending new tax increases with spending cuts beyond what his democratic allies are willing to offer now .	the rival house and senate budgets for the future are party-defining documents with zero chance of making their way into law as written , given the division of power in washington , where democrats control the white house and senate and conservative republicans dominate the house of representatives .	the house budget measure , if enacted into law , promises a balanced budget by the end of a decade ; the senate budget would leave significantly larger deficits but stabilize the national debt as a share of the economy , a measure that economists say is essential to avoiding a debt crisis like greece and other european nations have experienced .	house republicans are moving first with a plan sharply slashing health care for the poor , budgets for domestic agencies like the fbi and the national park service , and safety net programs like vouchers to purchase food .	senate democrats are countering with a mostly stand-pat approach that hikes taxes by almost $ 1 trillion over a decade while reversing already-enacted across-the-board spending cuts that are slamming both the pentagon and domestic agencies .	the automatic budget cuts ?	the so-called sequester ?	were designed to be so unpalatable to both sides that they would force democratic and republican members of a 2011 congressional " supercommittee " to agree on a sweeping anti-deficit plan rather than let them take effect .	but the congressional panel deadlocked .	the cuts were delayed for two months in a deal reached at the beginning of the year , but were triggered on march 1 after no agreement was reached on a budget deal .	avoiding a government shutdown this year requires a more delicate approach on a government-wide funding bill .	republicans controlling the house pushed a catchall spending measure repairing pentagon accounts devoted to military readiness and training , as well as veterans programs and several initiatives like modernizing the nation 's nuclear arsenal .	senate democrats countered with full-year , line-by-line budgets for the departments of justice and homeland security , among others .	all agencies would be subject to across-the-board cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 8 percent to the pentagon .	other agencies , including those responsible for implementing obama 's health-care plan and an overhaul of wall street regulation , would be denied increases and run on autopilot with last year 's budgets in place , subject to the across-the-board cuts .	the catchall bill advanced on a 63-35 procedural vote that sets up a vote tuesday to pass the measure and send it back to the house , which is likely to clear it later this week for obama 's signature .	passage of the huge spending measure would draw to a close a mostly overlooked battle between house republicans and obama and his senate democratic allies over the annual spending bills required to fund federal agency operations , paving the way for congress to turn away from the current budget year and resume battling over the future .	looking ahead , the latest republican plan crafted by house budget committee chairman paul ryan generally resembles prior ones , relying on higher tax revenues enacted in january and improved cost estimates for the medicare health care program for the elderly ?	along with $ 4.6 trillion in spending cuts over a decade ?	to promise a balanced budget in 10 years .	the budget counterproposal from senate democrats would repeal the sequester cuts at a cost of $ 1.2 trillion over a decade and blends about $ 1 trillion in modest cuts to health care providers , the pentagon , domestic agencies and interest payments on the debt with an equal amount in new revenue claimed by closing tax breaks .	the net result would cut about $ 600 billion from the deficit over 10 years .

a lawyer gives his client bad advice about a plea agreement , resulting in the defendant being deported or spending more time in prison than expected before being parole eligible .	if the kentucky supreme court agrees with federal prosecutors , that defendant wo n't be able to later appeal his conviction because of the lawyer 's bad advice .	the kentucky supreme court is weighing a request by the u.s. attorneys in louisville and lexington to overturn a kentucky bar association rule detailing what may be included in plea agreements .	the bar issued an ethics advisory opinion in november banning defense attorneys from advising a client about a plea agreement requiring them to waive their right to challenge the attorney 's performance at a later date .	in the same opinion , the bar ruled that prosecutors may not propose a plea agreement that requires someone to waive the right to attack a defense attorney 's performance on appeal .	in kentucky , ethics opinions approved by the high court are binding on all attorneys in the state .	the issue has arisen in florida , arkansas , virginia , florida and alabama .	in arkansas , defendants can waive the right to appeal an attorney 's performance .	others states , including florida , alabama and virginia take the opposite stance .	absent from oral arguments on thursday were any of kentucky 's commonwealth attorneys , who did not take a public stand in the ethics issue and do n't include such waivers in plea agreements .	assistant u.s. attorney terry cushing said the opinion could affect the plea negotiation process . "	there 's a give and take in the plea negotiation process , " cushing told the justices in a rare session at the university of louisville brandies school of law . "	the ultimate goal is truth and justice . "	defense attorneys told the court that including the provision in a plea agreement forces a defense lawyer into a conflict of interest ?	he has to put his own reputation against the needs of his client . "	we are the guardians of the client , " national association of criminal defense attorneys past president john wesley hall told the justices . "	we 're here to protect their interest . "	the justices seemed puzzled by the stance of the federal prosecutors .	repeatedly , the jurists questioned the need for the waiver and whether an attorney can be aware of their mistakes at the time a plea agreement is reached .	cushing told the justices that allowing later attacks on the performance of an attorney merely prolongs cases and hurts victims and their families . "	it 's about finality , " cushing said . "	victims of crime have gone through tremendous trauma when these things go through the courts . "	justice daniel venters said there is generally no way for a defendant to know if the attorney made an error until much later . "	it 's always hindsight in terms of defendants , " venters said .	justice lisabeth hughes abramson said all justices want to see cases closed , but they must be closed properly . "	you 're asking us to accept the lawyer who is singularly unaware of his own lack of due diligence to be the guardian of the defendant 's rights , " abramson said .	the case comes three years after the u.s. supreme court overturned kentucky 's high court in a case that hinged on an attorney 's deficient advice .	in that case , truck driver jose padilla was n't told he would face deportation if he pleaded guilty to hauling marijuana in the back of his truck .	the u.s. supreme court concluded that the lack of due diligence by padilla 's attorney affected the plea and padilla 's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was valid .	justice will t. scott noted that if the waivers had been in place in padilla 's case , he would have gone to prison and been deported based on bad advice .

june lehr is the grandmother three troubled youths never had .	the position can be challenging .	as a mentor through the heart river bridges of hope program , lehr is reaching out to juveniles who have been held at the north dakota youth correctional center in mandan .	one of them has re-offended and is in a women 's penitentiary in new england .	another young woman stays in touch from eastern montana , and lehr 's newest mentee is a 17-year-old male , who was recently released . "	i think , in their lives , i am the grandmother that they did n't have , " lehr said .	training of mentors is ongoing and took place most recently on nov. 22 at bismarck united church of christ .	the program was established three years ago to support juvenile offenders prone to falling through the cracks after release . "	we 're just trying to follow god 's lead , " said the rev. renee splichal larson , pastor of heart river lutheran church in mandan and mission developer for heart river bridges of hope . "	how do we be in relationships with young people when they 're out of corrections ?	it 's a lot of trial and error , trying to understand what really works . "	the program , supported by the evangelical lutheran church in america , is ecumenical in nature , and larson and nesheim work closely with partners , such as youthworks and the missouri valley family ymca .	unlike other social service programs , bridges of hope aims to build faith-based relationships with youth who are often recovering from addiction and unused to maintaining trusting relationships . "	we do know that relationships are powerful , " larson said . "	and that 's where we 're banking everything , in terms of transformation and care for the youth . "	youth sentenced to the correctional facility range from ages 12 to 20 and stay an average of seven to eight months , during which time they are provided with education opportunities , health services , addiction treatment and other coping skills .	they also have the opportunity to interact with mentors from the community . "	i felt if we could make a difference in the lives of these children , maybe we would n't have so many homeless by the age 40 or 50 , " said lehr , a home health nurse . "	if we do n't start focusing on these children , we might as well start building more jails . "
an effort to deny in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants has been narrowly defeated in the virginia senate .	introduced by republican sen. richard black of loudoun county , it was rejected 20-19 tuesday , largely along party lines in the republican-controlled chamber .	one republican , sen. john watkins of powhatan county , voted with minority democrats against the bill .	another republican , sen. jill holtzmann vogel of winchester , did not vote .	democrats argued against the measure , which they called mean-spirited and discriminatory .	republicans argued that the u.s. immigration system is dysfunctional and it is not the states ' job to fix it .	black 's bill was intended to override a ruling last year by democratic attorney general mark herring that some young people brought to the u.s. illegally by their parents qualify for in-state tuition rates .

trudging his way forward down the grassy range , army pvt. carlton causey slung his body ?	plus some 50 pounds of gear , armor and weapons ?	into the ground , simultaneously raising his m4 carbine to his right eye .	with steady concentration the young infantryman watched as a target popped up several hundred yards downrange .	causey squeezed the trigger and eliminated the threat with a series of rounds .	he and the other infantrymen in his rifle platoon quickly bounded back up , sprinted forward another 50 yards and carefully moved past another platoon as charlie company worked its way more than a mile down the fort stewart range to secure a pair of buildings during a combined arms live-fire exercise , or calfex .	it 's difficult work , even for grunts ?	infantrymen ?	such as causey whose jobs as frontline fighters demand they maintain top physical condition . "	bounding is pretty tough , " causey said after he completed the training assault on fort stewart 's bravo 18 range . "	getting up for a three - to five-second rush , get back down , and keep doing that for a couple hundred meters .	that 's tough with all the gear and the at4 ( anti-tank weapon ) flopping around back here , but once you get to the end of the bounding , it 's all worth it because you just get to shoot . "	that particular training event combined the infantrymen from the 3rd battalion , 7th infantry regiment of the 3rd infantry division 's 4th infantry brigade combat team with other army and air force assets including supporting fires from oh-58 kiowa helicopters , an artillery battery and a mortar platoon .	since early january , 4th brigade soldiers have conducted a series of dry - and live-fire exercises during vanguard focus , a training period of about 60 days designed to prepare the entire brigade for its late summer rotation to the army 's joint readiness training center at fort polk , louisiana .	although the pentagon has not identified 4th brigade for any upcoming deployment , the jrtc rotation will prepare the brigade 's light fighters for any possibility .	vanguard focus tests everyone from the brigade and battalion commanders down to the greenest foot soldiers , said 3-7 infantry battalion commander lt. col. scott shaw . "	it 's meant to train both soldiers and the battalion as a whole , " said shaw , who moved along the range as the soldiers conducted the feb. 20 calfex . "	the soldiers are participating as part of their companies .	so they 're getting individual skills training as it pertains to attacks , defenses and movement to contact operations and building field conditions and field craft . "	we 've seen just leaps and bounds of improvement since we came out here .	the soldiers are tremendously excited about what we 're doing . "	for causey , a soldier only a few months into his army career , an exercise such as calfex is exactly what attracted him to the infantry . "	it 's all a big adrenaline rush , and i really enjoy it , " causey said . "	it 's a good feeling .	you 're sucking and you 're sucking ( air ) and you 're breathing heavy after bounding and everything .	then you get down there and you get to just flip ( your rifle ) off safe and just go at it . "	it 's fun ; it 's nice .	it 's what being an infantryman is all about . "	the company-level live fire is among the most difficult tasks soldiers are asked to do during vanguard focus , said army capt. joseph lapointe , charlie company 's commander .	maneuvering three platoons across a field while firing live ammunition at targets is a challenge .	adding live rockets from aircraft and indirect fire from artillery and mortar teams only increases the difficulty .	still , lapointe said , there 's no great substitute for firing real ammunition on a mission . "	i love live fires .	it 's the best training opportunity we can do outside of deployment to get guys ready , " he said . "	every time you live fire it 's amazing .

the rate of discharge saturday was down from about 740 gallons per minute on friday .	but three days after the massive spill , the agency said it still did n't know what the possible environmental and health impacts are .	the agency said it hoped to have a thorough lab analysis of the contaminants -- which include lead and arsenic -- as soon as sunday morning . "	we 're busting our tails to get that out , " environmental protection agency regional director shaun mcgrath said . "	we know the importance to people to have this information . "	in the meantime , the epa said it had finished building two containment ponds to treat the yellow sludge .	however , the ponds are meant to immediately address the spill and cleanup efforts will likely take a long time .	mcgrath could not say whether that means days or weeks . "	this is a long-term impact .	the sediment , the metals that are in that sediment are going to settle out to the stream bottom , " he said . "	as we have storm surges , as we have flooding events , that sediment can and likely will get kicked back up into the water .	we 're going to have to do ongoing monitoring . "	about 1 million gallons of wastewater from colorado 's gold king mine began spilling into the animas river on wednesday when an epa-supervised cleanup crew accidentally breached a debris dam that had formed inside the mine .	the mine has been inactive since 1923 .	the plume reached the northern new mexico cities of aztec on friday night , farmington on saturday morning and kirtland on saturday afternoon .	the plume has been visually diluted and the leading edge of it is far less defined .	the water is reported to be muddy with an orange tinge rather than solid orange .	local government officials in new mexico and colorado have blasted the epa , saying they did n't alert communities soon after the spill and that answers have been slow in coming . "	there 's not a lot we can do .	we can keep people away ( from the river ) and keep testing .	we still do n't know how bad it is , " san juan county emergency management director don cooper said .	officials in both cities shut down the river 's access to water treatment plants and say the communities have a 90-day supply of water and other water sources to draw from .	no health hazard has been detected yet .	in addition to lead and arsenic , federal officials say the spill contains cadmium , aluminum , copper and calcium , but the concentrations were not yet known .	water samples were also tested in new mexico , but no results have been released .	in addition to new mexico , wastewater from the mine was also inching toward utah .	the animas flows into the san juan river in new mexico , and the san juan flows into utah , where it joins the colorado river in lake powell .	officials said the contamination would likely settle into sediment in lake powell .	glen canyon national recreation area officials said visitors will be warned starting monday to avoid drinking , swimming or boating on affected stretches of the lake and river until further notice .	the spill from the mine flowed down cement creek and into the scenic animas river , which is popular with boaters and anglers .	aerial photos showed the slow-moving yellow water snaking by scenic mountain roads surrounded by pine trees .	while awaiting further results on the concentration levels of the metals in the water , the epa released results saturday showing how acidic the water became after the spill .	in cement creek , near the spill , the water registered a ph level of 3.74 , which the epa said is similar to the acidity of tomato juice and apples .	further downstream , in silverton , ph levels were found to be about 4.8 , which is similar to liquid black coffee .	the epa warned people to stay out of the river and to keep domestic animals from drinking from it .	local officials declared stretches of the river off-limits in colorado and new mexico .	at least two of the heavy metals found in the waste water can be lethal for humans with long-term exposure .	arsenic at high levels can cause blindness , paralysis and cancer .	lead poisoning can create muscle and vision problems for adults , harm development in fetuses and lead to kidney disease , developmental problems and sometimes death in children , the epa said .	when the spill happened , the epa-supervised crew was trying to enter the mine to pump out and treat the water , epa spokeswoman lisa mcclain-vanderpool said .

south carolina authorities who have helped push for permission to block cell phone signals inside prisons say an officer in charge of keeping out contraband was nearly killed at his home ?	in an attack planned with a smuggled phone .	six months into his recovery , corrections department capt. robert johnson and his bosses want congress to change a 1934 law that says the federal communications commission can grant permission to jam the public airwaves only to federal agencies , not state or local ones .	the cell phone industry says the jamming methods some states want can interfere with emergency communications and legitimate cell phone use in the area .	they advocate other , potentially more expensive technology that they say can be more precise but has seen only limited use .	while authorities say johnson is the first corrections officer in the u.s. harmed by a hit ordered from inmate 's cell phone , other people have been targets .	in 2005 , a new jersey inmate serving time for shooting at two police officers used a smuggled phone to order a fatal attack on his girlfriend , who had given authorities information leading to his arrest .	two years later , a drug dealer in baltimore 's city jail used a cell phone to successfully plan the killing of a witness who had identified him as the gunman in a previous killing .	and in 2008 , a texas death row inmate used a cell phone to threaten the life of a state senator .	after that attempt , u.s. sen. kay bailey hutchison and u.s. rep. kevin brady introduced companion bills that would allow states to petition the fcc for permission to jam calls .	the senate passed its version , but the house version has languished , and supporters do n't expect it to move forward soon . "	it 's something that needs to be done , " johnson said . "	it will make the place more safe for the employees that are there and the public . "	jamming opponents say the technology could play havoc with communications between guards and paramedics , not to mention citizens near prisons . "	signals do n't stop and start at defined borders , " said john walls , a spokesman for ctia-the wireless association , which represents cell phone companies .	walls and others opposed to jamming advocate alternative ways to combat smuggled phones , including something called managed access , which uses radio frequencies to block signals from some cell phones while allowing other calls and emergency services transmissions to go through .	such technology works " like a scalpel " instead of simply blocking all calls , steve largent , ctia 's chief executive , wrote on his blog friday .	authorities activated one such system last month at the mississippi state penitentiary in parchman , and plan to expand it to two other facilities in the state .	fcc officials on hand for a demonstration last week pledged to work with other states that want to try it . "	we 're desperate , we 'll try anything , " south carolina prisons chief jon ozmint said .	south carolina got the fcc 's permission in 2008 to conduct a one-time test of a jamming system at lieber correctional institution , home to the state 's death row .	officials flipped a switch on a briefcase-sized device , which emitted a frequency that immediately shut down cell phones around the auditorium , while outside , cell service was uninterrupted .	those results more than satisfied ozmint .	maryland has tested similar equipment .	texas called off its own demonstration after state prosecutors advised prison officials the test would violate federal law .	the fcc has denied requests from the district of columbia and louisiana . "	the next hit 's being planned , and waiting for this technology is going to do nothing but cost more lives , " ozmint said .

"	investors can focus more clearly on the bright future that we believe lies ahead . "	yake upgraded his target price for biglari holdings shares to $ 500 from $ 475 , based on biglari 's weekend comments about prospects for sustained long-term growth .	the share price had dipped below $ 270 in early summer over concerns that biglari might enrich himself at investors ' expense .	he recommended a compensation plan that could reward him with more than $ 10 million a year in income simply by acquiring other businesses .	but a more modest salary-boosting pay plan was approved by shareholders nov. 5 .	the pay controversy was good for steak n shake because it " shook out money managers and investors who saw him as the second coming of warren buffett and wanted to follow him blindly , " said steven kiel , president of arquitos capital management , a virginia-based money management firm . "	the ' holders ' understand what he is trying to do . "	biglari took control of steak n shake in 2008 , cutting expenses and menu prices .	on saturday , biglari released a letter to investors reporting that same-store sales rose 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter - the seventh straight quarterly gain - after previously experiencing more than a dozen consecutive periods of negative returns .	customer traffic also rose 8.6 percent in the fourth quarter .

thousands of people streamed back to this historic southern city where new levees hastily built from clay and stone held back floodwaters that have inundated much of pakistan .	but thousands who fled the waters that inundated neighboring towns complained monday about the shortage of food and water as they camped in a vast muslim graveyard on a hill near thatta city .	hordes of people ran after vehicles distributing food and water near the graveyard , a chaotic effort that left many flood survivors ?	especially the old and infirm ?	with nothing .	some drank rainwater pooled on the ground . "	i can not run after food and survive the maddening rush at this age of mine , " said 75-year-old nasima mai , who fled with her extended family , mostly women and children . "	they throw food from the truck like animals are given food , " she said .	authorities said they were trying to provide food and shelter to the hundreds of thousands of people camped out on the hill in makli .	but as in other areas of the country , the scale of the disaster has overwhelmed both local capacity and the international partners trying to help . "	we are trying to set up a tent city in different parts of makli so that the distribution ( of aid ) could be organized , " said hadi baksh , a disaster management official in southern sindh province .	the floods started about a month ago in the northwest after extremely heavy monsoon rains and have slowly surged south along the indus river , devastating towns and farmland .	more than 1,600 people have died and 17 million more affected by the floods .	authorities struggled to save thatta on sunday , building new levees with clay and stone across a major road to hold back floodwaters that inundated the nearby town of sujawal .	many of sujawal 's 250,000 residents had already fled , but the water damaged houses , schools and other buildings in the town .	most of thatta 's 350,000 residents had also fled in recent days but began to return to the city as the danger passed , said baksh . "	we have raised the level of the ground and constructed a levee on the bypass to stop the water , and now the chances are very low that the water might run into the city , " said baksh .	thatta , which is about 75 miles ( 125 kilometers ) southeast of the major coastal city of karachi , contains several well-known mosques , including one built by shah jahan , the ruler of the mughal empire in india in the 1600s .	water levels are beginning to drop in sindh as the floodwaters flow down the indus river into the arabian sea , said baksh . "	in the coming days , the towns and villages will be out of flood danger , " he said .	but even after the floodwaters recede , pakistan will be left with a massive relief and reconstruction effort that will cost billions of dollars and likely take years .	muslim countries , organizations and individuals have pledged nearly $ 1 billion in cash and relief supplies to help pakistan respond to the floods , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , head of the 57-member organization of the islamic conference , said on sunday .	other foreign countries such as the united states and britain have also pledged millions of dollars , but many officials fear pakistan will still lack the funds necessary to recover from the worst natural disaster in the nation 's history .	associated press writer ashraf khan contributed to this report from karachi .

the city-loving night owl that has long defined the halston customer probably does n't get out into the garden much , so designer marios schwab gave her a few reminders of what it might be like out there : light , prettiness , softness .

"	i think we want to see ?	and a woman wants to dress ?	in a way that 's effortless , and that 's something we have n't seen in a long time .	we want to have something positive and the find the fancy of fashion and in dressing up , " schwab said .

cities along major rivers in iowa remained vigilant wednesday as flooding reached a peak , but the focus was turning toward clean up as waters will likely recede in the coming days .	at iowa city , the iowa river is expected to reach just above 25 feet wednesday and start falling sometime next week .	flood stage is 22 feet ; at 23 feet , the river causes moderate flooding , washing out roads and impacting some home basements and buildings .	less than an inch of rain fell tuesday and wednesday in the iowa river basin and more could come over the weekend , but not in significant amounts . "	we 're moving in the right direction , " dee goldman , the u.s. army corps of engineers operations manager at the coralville reservoir , said at a briefing wednesday .	university of iowa president sally mason told the board of regents that water was surrounding some campus buildings but had not gone into any of them because of flood barriers put in place last week .	she showed pictures of mayflower residence hall , where floodwaters were pushing up against the barriers but not breaching them .	mason also showed photographs of miles of similar barriers that were erected along the iowa river that was keeping the campus dry . "	it was truly monumental to see what can be done in three days to protect the campus , " she said .	emergency operations in johnson county are expected to be suspended on friday and the state has similarly cut back its emergency flood operations center . "	the shift is now turning toward recovery operations , " iowa homeland security and emergency management spokesman john benson said .	teams from state agencies and the federal emergency management agency are working their way from northwest iowa to southeast iowa to assess the level of damage to streets , roads , bridges , culverts , wastewater treatment facilities and city water operations .	national weather service meteorologist david cousins said the mississippi river will crest within the next couple of days at iowa locations south of the quad cities before the water begins to fall this weekend .	the river should reach its crest at 20.3 feet in burlington on thursday .	flood stage is 15 feet .
highway officials asked christmas revelers to stay off the roads tuesday as freezing rain and sleet pelted oklahoma and caused a 21-vehicle pileup that injured several people and snarled other motorists on a pair of cross-country interstates .	interstate 40 was closed for more than five hours at its intersection with i-35 near downtown oklahoma city after 10 accidents involving 21 vehicles .	both highways are major thoroughfares , but traffic was light because most holiday travelers were already at their destinations .	a powerful storm system expected to bring blizzard-like conditions to arkansas later tuesday swept into the southern plains overnight .	some parts of arkansas ' ozark mountains could get up to 10 inches of snow and blizzard conditions were possible from northeastern arkansas through the missouri bootheel and into southern illinois and indiana from tuesday evening into wednesday morning .	the pileup in oklahoma city began about 3 a.m. when a semitrailer jackknifed on interstate 40 on a bridge over the oklahoma river , state highway patrol trooper betsy randolph said .	other vehicles hit the semi , and then other semis slid into them , sandwiching the vehicles , she said . "	some of them , it took the entire top of the car off , like they slid under a semi , " randolph said .	the pileup included 10 separate crashes with 21 vehicles , including three semis , she said .	several people were taken to hospitals , but randolph did n't have details on their injuries or conditions .	the highway patrol shut down the interstate near its junction with i-35 for more than five hours and diverted traffic while troopers worked to clear the accident .	interstate 40 also was closed near clinton in western oklahoma because of overturned vehicles there and in eastbound lanes about 10 miles east of shawnee because of a jackknifed tractor-trailer .	all of interstate 40 , which bisects the state from east to west , was slick because rain was freezing as soon as it hit the pavement , randolph said .	traffic was light because most people had already reached their holiday destinations , " but the ones that are out there are having trouble staying on the road , " she said . "	we 're really discouraging travel , " she added . "	if you do n't have to get out , do n't . "
free speech cases top the u.s. supreme court 's docket as it begins a new term with a new justice and three women on the bench for the first time .	the court will look at provocative anti-gay protests at military funerals and a california law banning the sale of violent video games to children .	these cases worry free speech advocates , who fear the court could limit first amendment freedoms .	the first amendment of the u.s. constitution guarantees such basic rights as freedom of speech , religion and assembly .	the funeral protest lawsuit , over signs praising american war deaths , " is one of those cases that tests our commitment to the first amendment , " said steven shapiro , legal director of the american civil liberties union .	another case involves a different aspect of the first amendment , the government 's relationship to religion .	the justices will decide whether arizona 's income tax credit scholarship program , in essence , directs state money to religious schools in violation of the constitutional separation of church and state .	under chief justice john roberts , marking his fifth anniversary on the court , and with the replacement of justice sandra day o'connor by justice samuel alito , the court has been more sympathetic to arguments that blur the line between government and religion , as long as one religion is not favored over another .	justice elena kagan , confirmed in august , is the one new face on the court , but nearly everyone will be sitting in different seats when the term opens on monday .	like so much else at the supreme court , the justices sit according to seniority , other than the chief justice at the center of the bench .	the retirement of john paul stevens , who had served longer than the others , means roberts now will be flanked by justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy .	kagan and justice sonia sotomayor , who joined the court last year , will sit at opposite ends of the bench .	the woman with the longest tenure , justice ruth bader ginsburg , also is now the senior liberal-leaning justice with stevens gone .	though it 's never certain how changes will affect the court 's direction , president barack obama said he was looking for someone in the mold of the liberal-leaning stevens when he chose kagan .	if kagan votes as stevens did , her presence would not affect the ideological divide that has four justices on the conservative side , four on the liberal side and kennedy in the middle , though more often with the conservatives .	then , too , a justice 's first term is not necessarily a good predictor of future performance .	if anything , getting a read on kagan in her first year may be even harder because her former job as obama 's solicitor general already has forced her to take herself out of 24 of the 51 cases the court has so far agreed to hear .	the solicitor general is the top lawyer who argues the government 's cases before the high court .	the first case from which she is withdrawing will be argued monday , and kagan will slip out of the courtroom before roberts invites the lawyers to begin their argument .	kagan 's absences create the potential for the eight remaining justices to split 4-4 in some cases .	that outcome leaves in place the decision reached by the most recent court to have the case , but leaves unsettled the issue the high court was set to resolve .	a second arizona law , imposing penalties on businesses that hire illegal immigrants , also is before the court this term .	at issue is whether the state law intrudes into an area , immigration , that really is the federal government 's responsibility .	the result at the supreme court could signal how the court might resolve another suit working its way through the federal courts over the arizona immigration law that puts local police officers on the front lines of enforcing federal immigration law , said brian wolfman , a georgetown university law professor .	several cases that pit consumers against business also revolve around when federal law trumps state action .	in one case , parents of a child who suffered severe , lasting damage from a vaccine want to use state law to sue a drugmaker , even though congress has established a special court to hear disputes over vaccines .	the business community is asking the court to rein in the use of class actions in suits and arbitrations in state courts .	plaintiffs often can force large settlements without a trial if they succeed in pooling the claims of everyone who might be affected .	wal-mart stores inc. , backed by many business groups , wants the court to toss out an enormous class-action sex discrimination suit over allegations that it pays women less than men and promotes women less frequently .	the case could involve millions of women who once worked at the world 's largest private employer .	in recent years , the start of a new term has been accompanied by speculation over who might soon retire .	the same nine justices served together from 1994 to 2005 , an unusually long period of stability .	since 2005 , four new justices have joined the court .	the oldest justice is ginsburg , at 77 .	scalia and kennedy are 74 , while justice stephen breyer is 72 .	ginsburg has said she intends to stay on the court for five more years or so , and the other three septuagenarians have given no indication they are leaving anytime soon .

new york city mayor michael bloomberg endorsed fellow republican-turned-independent lincoln chafee in his run for governor thursday , saying people are tired of partisan politics and want solutions that chafee can deliver .	chafee , who left the republican party in 2007 , a year after losing his u.s. senate seat , is facing a heated four-way race for governor that includes democratic general treasurer frank caprio , who 's raised far more money than any other candidate in the race .	bloomberg , a billionaire and three-term mayor , called chafee the right man for the job and spoke about the chafee family 's history of public service in rhode island .	chafee 's father , john chafee , was a longtime senator and governor before his death in 1999 . "	he 's got the common sense and the integrity to stand up , tell people there 's no free lunch , tell people there 's no simple solutions to complex problems , and that they 're going to have to pull together and work hard , " bloomberg said shortly before endorsing chafee at an invitation-only event in a hotel in downtown providence .	bloomberg , once a democrat , also left the republican party in 2007 .	chafee , who said he asked for bloomberg 's endorsement , called bloomberg 's switch to independent " one of the hardest things you can do in politics .

"	it 's not good , " chafee said . "	if you 're going to govern by having secret meetings in a strip mall across the border , that does n't bode well for frank caprio 's campaign . "	caprio on thursday denied any offers were made to robitaille and said he said he welcomes communication with all of his opponents . "	we had a nice discussion .	we need to keep a line of communication open , " caprio said . "	with the twists and turns of the campaign you never know when you might need to contact each other to discuss an issue . "	chafee said he had never been asked by caprio to meet privately .

where others see decay , leslie pasmore sees sanctuary .	she has spent the past nine months converting a vacant , weed-strewn urban lot into a haven for birds .	after watching goldfinches , orioles and cardinals feed on weeds in the lot next to her home on 5th street in columbus ' weinland park neighborhood , she launched the campaign . "	those birds sounded so sweet , " she said . "	then , all of a sudden , the city brought this bobcat over with these big chains under it , and , in a matter of seconds , it was all clear .	i was so upset . "	pasmore went to the city and the weinland park community civic association with an unusual plea : do n't mow the vacant lot .	she suggested turning the lot into a bird sanctuary .	with their help , she received permission from the owner , wagenbrenner development , to do work on the site .	during several gatherings in the summer , pasmore and her helpers cleaned the lot , planted bird-friendly plants and trees , hung bird feeders and posted a painted plywood sign : " bird sanctuary of the 5th street neighborhood . "	the weinland park food and wellness committee , and the godman guild association spread the word and recruited volunteers .	lowe 's donated dwarf apple and plum trees .	local matters , a columbus nonprofit group that promotes local food growth , helped pasmore plan the garden and solicit donations .	the grange insurance audubon center contributed plants .	trish dehnbostel , a program manager with local matters , sees the sanctuary as part of a larger effort to maximize the value of empty urban lots .	she has talked to wagenbrenner about planting community gardens on more of the company 's weinland park lots .

"	i 'm always begging for birdseed , " she said . "	and money ! "	quipped julia orban , chairwoman of weinland park 's food and wellness committee .	gail laux , executive director of the ohio bird sanctuary in mansfield , praised pasmore 's efforts and noted that schools and other organizations have created similar butterfly or bird foraging areas on their grounds . "	it sounds like they have a great start by planting plants that generate food and shelter , " she said . "	it 's very exciting .	every little bit helps . "	pasmore is already enjoying the early fruits of her labors . "	i 've seen yellow goldfinches ; robins ; cardinals ; woodpeckers ; orioles ; some crows ?	but they do n't like what we have ; chickadees ; titmice ; mourning doves ; sparrows ; and , of course , squirrels , " she said .

a former state trooper thought he was putting his violent past behind him when he pleaded guilty to killing a black man during a civil rights-era protest in west alabama in 1965 .	but the fbi was n't part of james bonard fowler 's plea agreement and it has n't closed its investigation into that fatal shooting or another involving fowler a year later . "	our investigation is not affected , " chris allen , spokesman for the fbi 's cold case initiative , told the associated press on thursday .	that 's not what the 77-year-old fowler wanted when he pleaded guilty monday to a reduced charge of second-degree manslaughter and agreed to serve six months in jail .	fowler said his health was declining and his goal was to apologize to the family of jimmie lee jackson and put the matter behind him . "	i regret it every day , " he told the family .	after the plea , defense attorney george beck said , " justice has been served .	it puts to rest a long chapter of civil rights history here in perry county . '	beck said the fbi 's cold case inquiry never came up in plea talks . "	i was hoping that would quietly go away , " he said in an interview thursday .	however , beck and district attorney michael jackson said the fbi was not involved in the plea negotiations , and its investigation of old cases from the civil rights era is not bound by the plea agreement . "	that is totally separate , " the district attorney said .	jimmie lee jackson , 26 , was shot on feb. 18 , 1965 , when a voting rights march in marion erupted in violence .	witnesses said he was trying to protect his grandfather and mother from being clubbed by state troopers .	but fowler maintained jackson hit him on the head with a bottle and he fired to protect himself .	michael jackson , no relation to the victim , became the first black district attorney in perry county in 2005 and reopened the case at the request of constituents concerned that justice was never done .	the next year , the fbi launched its cold case initiative with a solemn mission : re-investigate long dormant cases from a period in america 's history when blacks and whites were killed in the south 's bloody fight to maintain segregation .	its list of 108 cases included jimmie lee jackson , as well as fowler 's shooting of nathan johnson in alabaster .	johnson , 34 , was arrested by fowler for suspicion of drunken driving on may 8 , 1966 .	fowler said he shot johnson because the suspect grabbed johnson 's billy club and began hitting him .	in both cases , state public safety officials serving under the direction of segregationist gov. george c. wallace investigated fowler 's arguments for self-defense and they agreed .	in the ensuing years , however , jimmie lee jackson was honored on historical markers and in civil right museums as a martyr of the movement .	johnson was largely forgotten .	his death did n't even rate a mention in fowler 's state personnel file .	so far , the fbi 's initiative has determined that more than half of its 108 cases ca n't be prosecuted because the prime suspect is dead .	in some others , the suspect was tried and acquitted on local charges and ca n't be tried again because of double jeopardy issues .	but others remain open , including the two involving fowler . "	the federal investigation is looking to see if a federal violation occurred .	those are often difficult to find because we have to use federal laws in effect at the time , " allen said .	just because the investigation is ongoing , " that does n't meant there is going to be a second half to this story .	it 's too early to say , " allen said .	the southern poverty law center in montgomery , which investigates hate crimes , has helped the fbi with its cold case initiative , but its leader is not hopeful of seeing any further action against fowler .	president richard cohen said the statute of limitations on civil rights violations was five years in 1965 , and federal prosecutors would have to find another crime without a statute of limitations if they tried to bring charges . "	i do n't think we should tell the justice department to call off the dogs , but i do n't think we should hold our breath , " he said friday .
a group of volunteers that helps abused and neglected children going through the jackson county court system will aid 1,000 children this year , the first time in its 30-year history that number has been served .	the milestone is " good news , bad news " for casa , or court appointed special advocates , said martha gershun , the group 's executive director .	it means casa has been able to help more children but also shows how demand for its services is growing , she said . "	it 's a horrible thing that so many kids need help , " gershun said . "	but it 's a good thing that casa is there to help . "	casa still represents only one-third of the children in the jackson county court system , the kansas city star reported ( http://bit.ly/1c74jrl ) .	the number of abuse and neglect cases referred to jackson county family court has increased 38 percent since 2008 , according to court records .	a struggling economy and decreased funding in missouri for social programs is likely fueling the increase , gershun said .	casa volunteers work one child or a sibling group to help them get the best outcome for the difficult situation .	they meet with the child , family and teachers and share information about the child with a family court judge or commissioner , who decides the child 's best interests .	that work helps fill in gaps for courts , attorneys and social workers who often are too busy to concentrate on one case , said jackson county family court administrative judge justine del muro .

rumors had swirled among anti-immigration activists near a u.s. border patrol station in southern california that the agency would try again to bus in some of the immigrants who have flooded across the u.s.-mexico border .	by friday afternoon , dueling anti- and pro-immigration rallies had assembled .	people in the crowd of 200 outside the station in murrieta waved signs and sometimes shouted at each other .	one banner read : " proud legal american .	it does n't work any other way . "	another countered : " against illegal immigration ?	great !	go back to europe ! "	it was not certain , however , that any buses would arrive on friday .	because of security concerns , federal authorities have said , they will not publicize immigrant transfers among border patrol facilities .	by late afternoon , many demonstrators were leaving .	murrieta police lt. jon flavin later said police arrested five people after a fight between two women in the crowd .	the city has become the latest flashpoint in the intensifying immigration debate when a crowd of protesters waving u.s. flags blocked buses carrying women and children who were flown from overwhelmed texas facilities amid an influx of immigrants .	in recent months , thousands of children and families have fled violence , murders and extortion from criminal gangs in guatemala , el salvador and honduras .	since october , more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained .	the crunch on the border in texas prompted u.s. authorities to fly immigrant families to other texas cities and to southern california for processing .	federal authorities had hoped to process some at the station in murrieta , about 55 miles ( 90 kilometers ) north of downtown san diego . "	this is a way of making our voices heard , " said steve prime , a nearby resident . "	the government 's main job is to secure our borders and protect us ?	and they 're doing neither . "	immigration supporters said the immigrants need to be treated as humans and that migrating to survive is not a crime . "	we 're celebrating the 4th of july and what a melting pot america is , " said resident raquel alvarado .	the city 's mayor , alan long , became a hero to those seeking stronger immigration policies with his criticism of the federal government 's efforts to handle the influx of thousands of immigrants , many of them mothers and children .	however , city officials tried to clarify long 's comments , saying he was only asserting that the local border patrol station was not an appropriate location to process the migrants .	the statement thursday by city manager rick dudley , suggesting that protesters had come from elsewhere in southern california , expressed regret that the busloads of women and children had been forced to turn around . "	it made this extremely compassionate community look heartless and uncaring .	that is not the murrieta that we all know and love , " he wrote .	long said by telephone friday that forcing the buses to turn around was neither planned nor called for . "	it 's not reflective of our city .	this controversial topic has turned us upside down , " long said . "	it just happened to land on our doorstep , and we want to be part of a solution . "	the border patrol is coping with excess capacity across the southwest , and cities ' responses to the arriving immigrants have ranged from welcoming to indifferent .	in nogales , arizona , the mayor has said he welcomes the hundreds of children who are being dropped off daily at a large border patrol warehouse .	residents have donated clothing and other items for them .	in new mexico , however , residents have been less enthusiastic .	at a town hall meeting this week , residents in artesia spoke out against a detention center that recently started housing immigrants .	they said they were afraid the immigrants would take jobs and resources from u.s. citizens .

"	we 're still working , " futrell said . "	we 're not through in the courts . "	in july , the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals rejected an appeal for sells and also refused a request for more than $ 60,000 to investigate evidence showing he should have received a sentence less than death .	sells was condemned for the new year 's eve 1999 attacks on the girls as they slept in a home near del rio , about 150 miles west of san antonio .	authorities said sells knew harris ' father through a church and had visited the home several times .	the survivor , surles , had been visiting from kansas at the time .	from her hospital bed , she was able to help police put together a sketch of the attacker , which helped lead to sells ' arrest days later .	she later would testify at sells ' capital murder trial , where jurors took just over an hour to convict him .	futrell said sells ' legal team would ask the u.s. supreme court this month to review sells ' case and whether the help sells received from attorneys at his trial and during earlier stages of his appeals was deficient .	sells , an oakland , calif. , native , worked as a barber , mechanic , laborer and carnival roustabout , hopping trains to get around the country .	investigators have said he 's confessed to using guns , knives , a bat , shovel , ice pick and his hands to commit more than a dozen murders and has claimed responsibility for 50 to 75 deaths .	some of those admissions , however , have not panned out .	besides in texas , he 's also been investigated for involvement in murders in missouri , illinois , oklahoma , kentucky , tennessee , west virginia , arizona and nevada .	at his trial for the del rio attacks , his lawyers argued he was pressured by detectives to make the statements .	in 2003 , he pleaded guilty to strangling a 9-year-old san antonio girl , mary bea perez , and accepted a life prison sentence .	in 2005 , he confessed to the 1987 slaying of suzanne korcz , 27 , a hairdresser from amherst , n.y. , a suburb of buffalo .	he was not tried for that slaying because prosecutors said he already was on death row in texas .	prison records show sells earlier served time in both missouri and wyoming for theft .

the lafayette airport commission has slowed down the process of building a $ 90 million passenger terminal to examine closely how to carry out what will be a yearslong , complex project .	the advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1hhyyzy ) the commission members were scheduled this week to decide whether to deploy a construction method that differs from the traditional way government projects are built .	called construction management , cmar brings the construction company in on the project during the design phase so pitfalls can be avoided in later phases .	cmar 's promoters also tout its faster completion time ?	in lafayette 's case , consultant walt adams has said it could knock a year off the project 's duration .	the commissioners also discussed and possibly approve a new contract for adams , who has championed the cmar method since he started advising the commission in december .	but instead of approving the measures , vice chairman paul guilbeau and the other commissioners chose to discuss and decide both issues at a later date : the project method will be vetted by the commission 's terminal committee , and adams ' contract will be run through the legal committee .	there is no date set for the committee meetings . "	we need to make sure these things get vetted through the proper channels , " airport executive director steve picou said thursday .	picou said the lack of action did not bring the project to a standstill .	the commission , he said , will solicit proposals from design firms in the near future then decide on a construction method later .	in january , the commission 's seven members unanimously chose picou to be the executive director of lafayette regional airport .	picou 's selection came about a month after a december election where lafayette parish residents voted to tax themselves 1 cent for each dollar they spent on taxable goods within the parish .	the tax started april 1 and will end nov. 30 , with estimated proceeds of $ 35 million to be dedicated to building a new terminal , expanding the parking area and other improvements .	the remainder of the total cost will be financed with a blend of state and federal airport grants and borrowed money .
the wyoming governor 's office is looking into possibly requiring petroleum companies that drill for oil and gas in wyoming to test the local groundwater for any pollution before they sink a drill bit into the ground .	the goal would be to make it easier to pinpoint the source of any groundwater contamination that turned up during or after drilling .	that could help any homeowners with contaminated well water to find out if oil or gas drilling in their area caused the problem or if the water pollution came from some other source .	gov. matt mead looks to implement a groundwater testing requirement by the end of this year , said his natural resources adviser , jerimiah rieman . "	most of the large operators do it but not all operators do it .	it really can protect citizens , protect the state , protect the industry , " rieman said monday .	either the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission , which oversees oil and gas development in the state , or the wyoming department of environmental quality , the state agency that enforces pollution laws , would adopt and implement the regulation .	the governor 's office is looking to new regulations in colorado as a possible template .	the colorado oil and gas conservation commission on jan. 7 approved requiring companies to sample up to four water wells within half a mile of a drilling site before drilling .	two more rounds of testing would occur between six and 12 months and five and six years after drilling .	no other state requires groundwater monitoring before and after drilling .	the governor 's office is wrapping up its look at what colorado has done and other states are considering .	next , it will assess whether the commission or deq would be the better agency to enforce groundwater testing in wyoming , rieman said .	in northeast wyoming , some people have blamed drilling for coal-bed methane for lowering their water table .	wyoming might require companies to note the volume of water flowing in water wells near oil and gas wells . "	we might add that element in after we look at it a bit further , " rieman said .	in theory , baseline groundwater testing could have helped landowners in the pavillion area who blame recent gas drilling for petrochemicals in their well water .	a 2011 u.s. environmental protection agency report found chemical traces in the groundwater that it linked to hydraulic fracturing .	state regulators and encana , which operates the pavillion gas field , dispute the conclusion , which has not yet been formally review by outside experts .	hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , involves pumping pressurized water mixed with sand and chemicals underground to crack open fissures and improve the flow of oil and gas .	the pavillion gas field is one of encana 's few wyoming properties with domestic water wells nearby .	most of the company 's wyoming projects are on public land with few people living nearby , encana spokesman doug hock pointed out . "	in colorado , a lot of the issue obviously revolves around drilling near people who have water wells and domestic water use , " hock said .	even so , encana is looking at baseline groundwater monitoring ahead of plans to drill hundreds of new gas wells in sublette and fremont counties , he said . "	bottom line is , it 's something we support .	we think it 's a best practice and i think it 's in the best interest of both operators and the public , " hock said .	the key is making sure that the public can look at the results of groundwater tests and that companies do n't just keep it to themselves , said richard garrett , a lobbyist for the wyoming outdoor council . "	just because they 've tested , themselves , does not necessarily give us a great deal of confidence .	we like the fact that they 're doing it but we think that better transparency helps everybody , " garrett said .	the petroleum association of wyoming has been asking its members what they think about the possible requirement , said association vice president john robitaille . "	we have heard back from several that they do this voluntarily already , several that do it at a request , and others that pretty much are a case-by-case basis , " said association vice president john robitaille .	comments on the proposal are still coming in from some oil and gas companies , he said , and the association will share their thoughts about the rules as they 're being developed .

"	hill , whose response to the documentary was published in the new york times , said rose seemed to be saying black athletes from two-parent families who went to duke were lackeys for whites - which is what the term " uncle tom " has come to mean .	the documentary 's characterization of duke 's players was " a sad and somewhat pathetic turn of events , " hill wrote .	@ even worse than that , it is a message to young blacks that rose needs to not just take back but also denounce .	i say this as someone who has a lot more in common with the childhood that drove rose to utter that opinion than the early life hill lived .	rose was one of four kids raised in poverty by a single mother .	he grew up poor in detroit and never met his father .	i was in the third grade in baltimore when my parents died .	i have precious few memories of either of them .	their deaths resulted in my siblings and me being split up .	members of my mother 's family divided us up among them based on how much of that burden they could afford to shoulder .	one of my brothers and i were sent to live with an aunt who had six children of her own .	soon after we arrived , her husband left the two-bedroom public housing unit we crowded into .	i spent the next 20 years of my life in subsidized housing .	hill grew up well off in a virginia home with two successful parents .	his father , calvin hill , was an nfl star running back .	his mother was a lawyer .	he lived a comfortable , upper middle-class life that led him to duke university .	rose emerged from his impoverished childhood to attend michigan , which is hardly a third-rate degree mill .	since the first airing of his documentary , rose has offered a tepid explanation of the uncle tom label he brandishes .	he says that 's what he thought of the black duke players in the 1990s , not what he thinks of them now .	that 's not good enough .	he needs to say he was wrong at age 18 to have thought that of duke players .	he ought to say that toxic label should be reserved for people who truly sell out the race , not those whose success opens real doors of opportunity for other blacks .	in the college basketball teams they played for , there is little real difference between rose and hill .	each belonged to a prestigious , mostly white higher education institution .	what rose really needs to say about the blacks who played alongside him at michigan and against him at duke - as i 've learned in my life - is that the road to success has many on-ramps .	contact wickham at dewaynewickham ( at ) aol.com .
poland 's new president formally took control of the nation 's military sunday and unveiled a plaque to the victims of the plane crash that killed his predecessor and 95 others .	bronislaw komorowski , who as the country 's president bears the role of commander in chief , took control of the armed forces in a ceremony on army day , the august 15 holiday that honors a stunning polish victory against russian bolsheviks in 1920 .	in a ceremony at warsaw 's central pilsudski square , komorowski knelt at a military banner and kissed it as he was surrounded by soldiers .	the event was marked by other military pomp , including a parade , the playing of trumpets and the firing of cannons .	komorowski was sworn in as poland 's new president more than a week ago , making him the fourth democratically elected head of state since poland threw off communism , and the successor to lech kaczynski , who was killed in the plane crash in russia .	a bitter political and religious dispute is raging over how to memorialize kaczynski and the other victims .	the focus of controversy has been a large wooden cross in front of the presidential palace that kaczynski 's supporters have surrounded around the clock for many days .	they want to keep the cross there until a major memorial is built to the victims and have prevented authorities from moving it to a nearby church .	komorowski and many secular-minded poles object to the cross because they say a public building is not the right place for a religious symbol in a country that by law is defined as secular .	on saturday some supporters were removed to make way for sunday 's parade , though the cross was left in place .	nevertheless , the protesters reacted by erecting a second cross across the street from the palace .	komorowski has taken steps in recent days to try to appease the self-described " defenders of the cross . "	earlier this week he had a plaque to the victims ?	engraved with a small cross ?	put up on the presidential palace .	on sunday he unveiled yet another plaque at the field cathedral of the polish army to the plane crash victims , who included some of the country 's top military brass .

the archdiocese of seattle said wednesday it wo n't change its mind about rehiring a gay vice principal who was encouraged to leave a seattle-area catholic high school after school officials learned he had married his same-sex partner .	catholics protesting the departure of mark zmuda , a popular teacher , coach and vice principal , also turned in a petition to eastside catholic high school and the archdiocese on wednesday .	the petitions turned in wednesday were gathered by faithful america , a national christian organization , which called on the archdiocese to reinstate zmuda .	another petition started on change.org by the senior class president has gathered more than 30,000 signatures since late december .	it wants to change the catholic church 's stance on gay marriage .	the archdiocese responded with a statement saying they stand by the decision to replace zmuda . "	the recent personnel decision by the board and administrators of eastside catholic regarding mr. zmuda was made after a great deal of prayer and consultation , " archbishop j. peter sartain wrote . "	in no way was their goal to be discriminatory to anyone but to be faithful to their mission as a catholic school . "	the school board of trustees wrote to parents detailing the events leading up to zmuda 's departure on dec. 20 and invited them to attend a parent meeting next week .	the letter explains that all employees of the private school are required to sign an agreement that their public behaviors would at all times be consistent with the values and teachings of the catholic church .	the church does not recognize gay marriage , the letter pointed out . "	when mr. zmuda married his same-sex partner , the school administration was left with no acceptable alternative that would allow him to remain eligible for employment at eastside catholic school , " the letter to parents said .	senior class president bradley strode , 17 , of bellevue , said the students want to effect change within the wider catholic church , with an ultimate goal of altering the catholic church 's stance on gay marriage .	the student protest began as a sit-in at the school and has since spawned outside rallies both near the school and near the archdiocese in seattle .	this had been zmuda 's first year as an administrator at the school with nearly 700 high school students and more than 250 middle school students in sammamish , a seattle suburb .	another gay educator at eastside catholic , who recently announced she was engaged to her same-sex partner , said last week that the school had given her a new employment agreement as an independent contractor .	stephanie merrow , a part-time musical coach who is choreographing this year 's spring musical , was told by school administrators that her marital status does not matter .	she said her contract did not mention catholic teachings .	contact donna blankinship at https://twitter.com/dgblankinship eastside catholic : http://www.eastsidecatholic.org/ faithful america petition : http://act.faithfulamerica.org/sign/eastsidecatholic/ change.org petition : https://www.change.org/petitions/united-states-conference-of-catholic-bishops-change-the-roman-catholic-church-s-stance-on-gay-marriage
new jersey 's largest city may cut workers ' hours and even eliminate the purchase of items such as toilet paper if needed to close a $ 70 million budget deficit .	newark mayor cory booker announced wednesday that 1,450 non-uniformed city workers would begin a four-day work week on sept. 27 ?	which would represent a 20 percent pay cut .	he also would close the city 's pools aug. 2 and take other measures unless some type of agreement can be reached between his administration and the city council .	the proposal came after the council deferred action on the creation of a municipal utilities authority , which is a key part of booker 's budget .	he said that left him with a $ 70 million budget hole to plug .	booker has proposed a $ 600 million budget , which includes the possibility of laying off as many as 350 police and firefighters .	he does n't want to resort to huge tax increases to offset the deficit , because he fears higher taxes would cripple the city 's economy .	and when he brought up the potential elimination of toilet paper and other items the city contracts for , he was trying to make sure that people " saw the big picture " about the city 's finances , his press secretary said thursday . "	he used the toilet paper as an example , that we 're scrutinizing everything in the budget no matter how small .	but instead of financial issues , we 've been getting questions today about what brand the city uses and how much it has on hand , " esmeralda diaz cameron said thursday evening . "	the mayor wants to make sure that people realize this ( the budget ) is a very serious matter that has to be properly addressed . "	city council members , though , feel that booker is trying to put the onus on them instead of dealing with the matter himself .	during a news conference thursday , some council members accused the mayor of using " fear tactics " and " poisoning the dialogue " with his posturing on the city 's finances . "	this ( the budget ) is the mayor 's issue .	we advise and consent on the budget .	it 's the mayor 's job , " council president donald payne jr. said . "	press conference after press conference , he says the council is not doing its job . "	they also faulted booker for not holding town hall meetings on the mua proposal and announced their own schedule of meetings on the matter , with the first planned for monday night .	speaking later thursday , payne said the council also was concerned about " the vagueness " of booker 's mua proposal , such as how it would operate and where the money for it would come from .	he also said the budget as a whole fails to address the city 's " structural deficit .

washington liquor sales are showing signs of continued strength after the state moved to a privatized system .	state figures released tuesday show that sales by volume were up 12 percent in august compared to the year earlier .	that increase came despite prices being up 10 percent .	tax revenue was also up by about $ 4 million in the month .	washington voters approved the privatization shift last year , and private liquor sales began in june .	sales initially dropped in the first month , something state officials attributed to businesses and residents stocking up before the transition .	sales have now been up by double digits in both july and august .	washington 's chief economist , steve lerch , said he expects sales and revenues to remain higher than before privatization but he says there is still uncertainty in those projections .
gov. nikki haley said wednesday that while she 's looking for a conservative fighter to replace u.s. sen. jim demint , no one would be as conservative as him .	she also told reporters she periodically asks former first lady jenny sanford , who has been named as a finalist , for advice on her job performance .	the republican governor has sole authority to appoint demint 's successor until voters pick one in 2014 to fulfill the final two years of his term .	demint , a tea party favorite known to buck party leadership , announced last week he would resign jan. 1 to lead the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank . "	there is no question that i 'm looking for a conservative person to fill those shoes , but we are never going to find someone as conservative and staunch as jim demint , " haley told reporters after a budget and control board meeting . "	what i do think we 'll find is someone who very much understands the state of south carolina . "	haley gave no indication of when she would choose demint 's successor .	state law sets no timeline on her decision .	on wednesday , state rep. rick quinn pre-filed legislation that would require a special election for any future u.s. senate vacancies .	in a statement , the republican said he felt voters should play more of a role in selecting someone to fill such an important office .	haley has reportedly narrowed her choices to five .	the list includes former first lady jenny sanford , who endorsed and campaigned with haley during her 2010 four-way primary .	haley said she has stayed in touch with sanford since taking office . "	at times i 've asked her opinion on things , or if i see her somewhere , i 'll just say , ' do you have advice for me ? ' "	haley said . "	i do that with any former governor i see , as well , and so she 's one of those people i look at .	she 's lived it .	she 's been through it .	she 's a confidante that i 've always looked to to just tell me what i 'm doing wrong and tell me what i 'm doing right . "	sanford became hugely popular as her ex-husband 's political career nose-dived .	the mother of four sons divorced former gov. mark sanford after he infamously disappeared over father 's day weekend in 2009 and returned from argentina to confess an affair .	a source close to the governor said tuesday that the other four on haley 's list are u.s. reps. tim scott and trey gowdy , former two-term attorney general henry mcmaster and catherine templeton , the director of the state 's public health and environmental control agency .	haley declined to comment on other potential picks .	she said her decision process involved looking at candidates ' philosophical beliefs and determining how they would vote on upcoming decisions .	she also wants to make sure they want to seek the office past her two-year appointment .	haley has ruled out sending herself to washington or running for the seat herself in 2014 . "	with the fiscal cliff , with the debt issue , with everything we 're facing in state government , how are those people going to respond and how are they going to agree with what jim demint would 've done ? "	haley asked . "	and are they going to fight ?	we need some more fighters in washington right now . "	haley said political experience was not a factor . "	it 's not about time in office , which is the wrong way of looking at the government , " haley said .	gowdy and scott were both re-elected last month to their second terms in congress .	gowdy was formerly a solicitor .	before a single term in the state house , scott was the charleston county council chairman .	mcmaster was the state gop chairman before voters elected him attorney general .	though jenny sanford has never been in elected office herself , she ran her ex-husband 's campaigns and was known to be his chief political consultant .	templeton was an attorney specializing in fighting labor unions before haley picked her to run the state 's labor and licensing agency .	with haley 's blessing , templeton was then chosen in february to lead the much larger department of health and environmental control .

a legal fight has broken out between the school district and city council over funding for schools in mississippi 's largest city .	the clarion-ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/qbpqbv ) that the jackson public school district filed a lawsuit against the jackson city council accusing the city of refusing to raise enough taxes to cover a budget request by the school board .	council members were given copies of the suit earlier this week .	the suit , filed in hinds county circuit court , challenges the council 's sept. 14 decision to raise taxes by 2.5 mills on the school system 's behalf .	the school board says that tax rate wo n't be enough to cover a budget request of $ 88.9 million .	the tax rate was proposed in support of an $ 86.1 million budget the jackson school board first approved in june .	but since then , jps , under the new leadership of superintendent cedric gray , amended its total budget request to $ 88.9 million .	the new request , which includes operating funding as well as bond repayments , does not specify how many more mills would be needed to support it .	in recent years , the district 's millage has been set at 74.99 mills .	the city attorneys at the time advised the council not to approve a tax hike that would cover the full request because the public was not properly notified .	under state law , school districts can not raise taxes without publishing their intent to do so in the newspaper .	the success of the suit will depend on whether the alleged problems with public notice are sufficient for the city to duck its legal responsibility to levy taxes on the school board 's behalf .	under state law , the council is required to levy enough taxes to fund the full amount requested by the school board .

vermont inmates at a private prison in michigan with which the state has a contract , as well as in-state prisons in newport and st. johnsbury , recently were allowed to begin using the new email system , said mike touchette , director of facility operations for the corrections department .	inmates can go to a kiosk to use the system or can buy an electronic tablet that allows them to communicate with the system , which is run by jpay , a private company providing the prison email service .	jpay also offers a video service -- at $ 9.95 for a 30-minute session .	inmates also can download songs and electronic books .	touchette said kiosks have been installed in all seven of vermont 's prisons ; most are still awaiting completion of the wiring , he added .	at the st. johnsbury prison , superintendent alan cormier said , the electronic communications are especially helpful to inmates with families out of state .	and he said the games , music and videos inmates can get through the system can cut down on boredom . "	from a safety and security standpoint , if they 're occupied and not bored , we have a safer facility , " cormier said .	the system is different from email services offered to the general public outside the facilities in several respects , touchette said .	one is cost ; senders pay 40 cents per email .	the tablets are different from the standard ipad , as well -- they are more robust and tamper-proof , he added .	the costs , which are higher in some of the states that have introduced video visitation , trouble some inmate advocates , who say they can burden often low-income families .	defender general matt valerio , whose office includes a prisoners ' rights office , said as currently designed , the system will not be used for communications between inmates and their lawyers , because it is monitored by corrections department personnel .	touchette said the monitoring is to guard against illicit content .	one sender of an email to an inmate attached a photo in which " she exposed her breasts to the inmate , so that was terminated , " he said .	suzi wizowaty , executive director of vermonters for criminal justice reform , a group that advocates for prisoners ' rights , called the new email system a welcome development . "	i 'm really pleased that it exists , " she said . "	i 'm getting emails from people that are really enlightening about what 's going on .	... it 's quicker .	sending a letter from a jail can take a really long time .	here i 'm able to get information about an immediate situation , like two men were just taken to the hospital as the result of a fight . "	the new tools are not without their critics , who cite the costs , the fact that some jails are pushing to eliminate in-person visits in favor of video conferencing , and technical difficulties .	the video systems often are " very glitchy , " said bernadette rabuy of the massachusetts-based prison policy initiative , an inmates ' rights group . "	it 's pretty obvious when you try them that they 're far worse than the experience of a through-the-glass visit , " she said .	wizowaty has been a critic of vermont 's use of private prison contractors , and she said that skepticism extends to the private companies providing the new electronic services . "	i think it 's a new way for corporations to make money , " wizowaty said . "	i do n't think there 's any altruism in it . "	but , " not everything that makes money is bad .	this does turn out to have a benefit to inmates and their families , because it does enhance communication , and that 's a good thing . "

the chester river that winds past chino farms outside chestertown is one of hundreds throughout the chesapeake bay watershed that receives fertilizer , agriculture and sediment from the farms it passes , bringing it eventually to the chesapeake bay downstream .	federal agriculture officials hope the chester river watershed will also become a model for stopping the cycle of pollution that has robbed the bay of its vitality .	they were at the farm friday to announce the river 's watershed along with two others in pennsylvania and virginia had been chosen as pilot projects for restoration efforts throughout the six-state watershed .	while farmers throughout the watershed have been working for years to limit the runoff from their lands , the officials said the pilot projects were an intensification of that effort in response to a presidential executive order last year mandating a federal bay restoration strategy .	hans schmidt , a queen anne 's county farmer and vice president of the maryland association of soil conservation districts , said the project included efforts to reach out to all landowners and farmers in the river 's watershed , including what he called smaller " farmettes " that may have just a few horses or other animals .	schmidt said the project would use computerized mapping software and other techniques to try and reach all landowners " and find out where the holes are " in current restoration programs .	farmers and federal agriculture officials also repeatedly noted during friday 's events that suburban and urban runoff is the only source of pollution that is increasing in the bay watershed , while the agriculture sector has taken steps to cut the pollution it sends to the bay .	they said farmers were willing to voluntarily work to limit bay pollution , a sign of concern over increasing regulation and the threat of sanctions in the restoration strategy .	earl f. " buddy " hance , maryland 's agriculture secretary , challenged landowners and farmers to " step up " and work to further cut pollution . "	we do n't need regulation .	we can do this through voluntary practices , and our farmers will do the right thing , " hance said .	robert mcaffee , the nrcs ' chesapeake coordinator , said the pilot project and the projects for the smith creek watershed in virginia 's shenandoah valley and the conewago creek watershed near hershey , pa. , showcased the voluntary nature of the effort . "	there 's a time and place for regulation , but at the same time we have voluntary practices and we have farmers that are willing to work with us and get those practices on the ground , " mcafee said .	beth mcgee , a senior scientist with the chesapeake bay foundation , which has sued the federal environmental protection agency over the slow pace of bay restoration , said she liked the way the chester project tied measurement of water quality improvement over time to the practices being implemented .	however , mcgee said she was concerned about whether the pilot projects could be expanded throughout the six-state watershed and said monitoring , accountability and regulation were needed . "	if we can model this throughout the watershed , great , but i suspect we 're not going to have the resources to do that , " mcgee said .

( ap ) ?	a west virginia democrat who narrowly lost a congressional race last year has decided against seeking a rematch .	mike oliverio came within 1 percentage point of winning the state 's 1st district seat in the u.s. house of representatives .	he filed pre-candidacy paperwork in september for a 2012 run , but on friday said he 's changed his mind .	the 48-year-old former state legislator said in a statement that he 'll instead resume the role of an active citizen .	federal filings show that oliverio 's campaign fund raised nearly $ 11,000 in the last three months but also listed $ 27,000 in debts .	republican rep. david mckinley won last year 's race .	also a former state lawmaker , the freshman enters 2012 with an $ 848,000 campaign balance .	mckinley 's remaining potential challengers include democrat susan thorn and independent raymond davis .

after the hip-hop party was over , the cheering supporters back in their tents and the speaker trucks parked for the night , newly minted presidential candidate wyclef jean sat down to talk business ?	promoting haiti 's and defending his own .	the potential front-runner in haiti 's nov. 28 election told the associated press that he supports the u.s. and u.n. vision for rebuilding haiti 's economy after its magnitude-7 earthquake ?	a plan that encourages private investment in factories , agriculture and other areas .	he also hit back at critics of his own personal finances , including allegations over his use of post-quake charity funds and the revelation he personally owes $ 2.1 million in back taxes to the united states . "	we can provide a way to get ( haitians ) out of the mess they 're in .	and the way that that 's going to happen ( is ) education , job creation and investment for haiti , " jean said in the wide-ranging interview thursday evening .	he spoke in a port-au-prince hotel room as aides , his wife and 5-year-old daughter looked on .	the haitian-born , brooklyn-raised singer is attempting a difficult and potentially dicey transformation : from multimillionaire international recording artist to leader of one of the world 's poorest and most dysfunctional countries ?	and doing so through a pivotal and difficult election .	among the best known figures in his native country , jean ?	who left as a child ?	speaks american-accented creole to crowds and new york-accented english at home .	his estimated annual income of up to $ 18 million is more than 13,000 times more than the average haitian sees in a year ?	assuming that person even has a job .	if he wins the presidency , the ex-fugee frontman said he would encourage donors to invest heavily in education .	he also endorsed the economic vision promoted by former u.s. president bill clinton , the u.n. special envoy who is in haiti this week .	those plans include creating jobs in the garment export industry , boosting tourism and building the capacity of haitian farmers to reduce the nation 's chronic dependence on imports . "	president clinton is focusing on the garment industry and all that .	i think that 's great .	but also agriculture is involved , " jean said . "	we can work both components at the same time . "	among other potential investment targets he mentioned mining , an industry whose ramping up amid the rising price of gold and other minerals has sparked controversy in the neighboring dominican republic .	jean 's leap from entertainer to prospective head-of-state is also leading to some interesting transitional moments .	after previously listing his age as 37 , as a candidate he suddenly jumped to 40 years old .	on thursday he traded his urban hip-hop style for a dark suit , better to hide the rubble dust and handprints as he crowd-surfed to open his rally .	the worldwide attention that his presidential bid attracts also means scrutiny and criticism ?	turning the campaign into what jean called a " combat sport . "	he responded directly thursday to a revelation published this week on the u.s.-based website the smoking gun concerning his unpaid u.s. taxes . "	first of all , owing $ 2.1 million to the irs shows you how much money wyclef jean makes a year , " he said , pledging to publish an accounting of his finances online and to repay the money he owes .	the singer also fumed when aides told him that actor sean penn , who has been managing an earthquake-survivor camp in the haitian capital since the spring , had accused jean of not spending enough time in haiti after the quake and misappropriating $ 400,000 of the $ 9 million his charity , yele haiti , raised after the disaster . "	i just want sean penn to fully understand i am a haitian , born in haiti and i 've been coming to my country ever since ( i was ) a child , " he said . "	he might just want to pick up the phone and meet , so he fully understands the man . "	jean stepped down from his chairmanship of yele on thursday ahead of his run for office .	the organization has been accused of pre-quake financial improprieties that benefited the singer .	before campaigning can begin , jean must be cleared to run by haiti 's eight-member provisional electoral council .	among the requirements he must fulfill are proving he has never renounced his haitian citizenship by holding another ?	namely , u.s. ?	passport ; and that he has been a resident of haiti for the last five years ?	which by most accounts he has not .	the campaign will argue that jean 's status as a haitian ambassador-at-large , a post he was awarded in 2007 , exempts him from having not spent more time in the country of late .	if approval comes , haiti 's particular brand of byzantine and often brutal politics will really begin .	jean 's charisma and popularity in port-au-prince 's vast slums could draw comparisons ?	some favorable , others not ?	to the popular but divisive former president jean-bertrand aristide , who was flown into african exile aboard a u.s. plane during a bloody 2004 rebellion .	on thursday , jean took the stage at his rally as supporters sang a traditional pro-aristide song , replacing the exiled leader 's name with jean 's .	asked what prompted that particular tune , jean replied he had n't picked it .	the singer ultimately sees himself as an advocate for haiti 's struggling youth .	officially running under the banner of the viv ansanm party ?	whose name means " live together " ?	jean is more heavily promoting his youth movement called " fas a fas , " meaning face-to-face . "	even if i lose , i win , " he said . "	it gives us an opportunity to be a voice to speak to government about what happens . "

at the colorado mountain ranch one recent day , throngs of children scattered across the property .	some rode horses while others performed gymnastic flips or explored nature through hikes .	summer camp was in full swing .	yet a little more than three years ago , questions loomed as to whether this kind of activity ever would take place again at the more than 60-year-old educational camp for kids and young adults off gold hill road .	when the fourmile fire ravaged the foothills west of boulder on labor day in 2010 , many feared the colorado mountain ranch had been lost to the blaze , which was , at that time , the most destructive wildfire in colorado 's history .	as the third anniversary of the fourmile fire nears , business at the colorado mountain ranch -- which lost 35 structures , but did not burn completely -- has recovered , but plenty of work remains , said jojo morrison , creative director .	officials are starting to develop the new thunderbird lodge , which will replace the children 's activity center that was lost in the fire .	the ranch 's owners hope the new facility -- which could be built in a habitat for humanity-style effort through donated supplies and labor -- will help re-launch the property as a year-round facility for outdoor programs , morrison said .	additionally , officials have started the process to obtain 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit status in a move aimed at sustaining the ranch for future generations . "	some parents have said , ' oh , that 's great .	you were n't affected by the fire , ' " morrison said . "	we 're glad it 's not showing as it once did , but we do n't ever want to forget where we came from and what we 've been through . "	as the fourmile fire raged , the initial videos , photos and stories related to the colorado mountain ranch were bleak .	helicopter fly-overs showed fields of black and ash .	trees and buildings were consumed .	vehicles -- including a couple former school buses -- were charred .	owners mike and lynn walker helped save 10 structures , including the main lodge , cabins and the office .	the walkers lost their family house to the fire , but have made a new home in a couple of rooms inside the main lodge .	during the following months , the walkers and volunteers cleaned up the property and used the felled trees to build a new barn that housed tack and tools donated by others .	most of the insurance money was put toward the barn . "	we needed our horse program to be functional , " morrison said .	with that critical piece of the program in place to help get the camp on steady footing , colorado mountain ranch officials now are moving forward on the next step : rebuilding the children 's activity center that burned in the fire .	efforts are underway to develop the thunderbird lodge , an enclosed building that not only will house activities such as gymnastics , theater and music , but also help the ranch transition into a year-round operation by allowing for a large , indoor space suitable for meetings , morrison said .	thunderbird lodge , at two stories and 2,850 square feet , will be larger than its predecessor , reduced to a 40-by-40-foot foundation slab .	the thunderbird lodge project has an estimated value of $ 300,000 , but morrison said she believes the building would come together in fashion similar to a habitat for humanity project with donated materials , labor and funds . "	our goal is to build a building , " she said . "	how that happens is to be found out . "	spurring the initiative for the new thunderbird lodge was solarglass co. , a boulder-based firm that replaced the windows in the camp 's main lodge to assist in winterizing efforts , morrison said .	solarglass plans to donate the windows for the building , she said . "	so many people have told us they wanted to give back , " she said . "	... not everyone has $ 300,000 , but they can pick up a hammer . "	the ranch has continued some of its activities , such as gymnastics , by constructing a makeshift , partially open-air structure consisting of felled trees , a tarp and a plastic orange barrier fence . "	it 's great when we can be outside , but you never know what the weather 's going to be like , " she said .	if the thunderbird lodge comes together by next year as planned , its presence -- combined with that of winterized cabins -- could allow the ranch to become more of a year-round operation , morrison said , noting that officials already have received calls to host winter weddings and corporate retreats .	john tayer , president and chief executive officer of the boulder chamber , said the operation could serve as a regional draw . "	obviously ( the fourmile fire ) was a tragic circumstance for so many individuals and businesses , but having said that , we live in a resilient entrepreneurial community and it does n't surprise me that we would see ( people ) either recreating businesses or developing new business concepts in a community where innovation flourishes , " tayer said . "	to me , it 's all part of just the character of this community . "
venezuelan officials kept silent friday on the arrest earlier this week of two nephews of first lady cilia flores on u.s. drug trafficking charges .	the south american country 's opposition leaders , meanwhile , made the news the focus of their rallies to mark the launch of the campaign season for crucial dec. 6 congressional elections .	the men related by marriage to president nicolas maduro were arrested in haiti on tuesday on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the united states .	they are being held in new york without bail .	the opposition hammered on the scandal on friday during nationwide events celebrating the official start of the fight for control of congress -- a battle that polls indicate the government may lose badly .	opposition leaders said the arrests had shocked the nation and showed the need for change after 16 years of socialist rule .	the most hard line party in the opposition coalition , popular will , referred to the arrests in its slogan for the campaign launch : " today we start the shift from narco state to a better venezuela . "	u.s prosecutors have investigated several high-level venezuelan officials for drug and corruption charges , but this week 's arrests marks the first time maduro 's family has been directly implicated .	even many government critics were surprised because they tend to see maduro , the hand-picked successor to late president hugo chavez , as incompetent but not especially corrupt .	neither maduro nor any other governing official has commented on the arrests , and national media has largely blacked out the news .	one of the country 's largest daily newspapers reported on the drug bust , but left out any connection to the first family .	instead , state television has been broadcasting footage of government giveaways , with poor residents lining up to receive laptops , appliances , and keys to newly-built apartments .	on friday , maduro filled his twitter feed with images of chavez , as well as warnings to his followers not to trust biased media .	on twitter , venezuelans posted memes and jokes poking fun at a weekly television show flores hosts titled " celia with her family , " and mocking the administration for banning a telemundo soap opera the week of the arrests on the grounds that it glorified the lifestyle of drug traffickers .	the opposition coalition held a press conference to denounce the " monstrous censorship " the case revealed , and promised to launch an official investigation once it wins control of congress .	opposition governor and former presidential candidate henrique capriles demanded an official response , though he did not really seem to expect one . "	the case shows how rotten this government is , " he said .

there 's no shortage of speculation about his whereabouts , but there is a dearth of credible information . "	there 's an 80 ( percent ) to 90 ( percent ) chance he 's in the south areas of libya , " claimed abdul rahman bussin , a military spokesman for the transitional government , who said that people from the nomadic tuareg tribe were protecting him .	the country 's new leaders have vowed that gadhafi will be brought to justice for the crimes committed during his 42 years in power .	the international criminal court issued a warrant for his arrest in june .	the tuareg people live in a vast desert area on the long , porous borders shared by libya , algeria and niger .	a representative for the tuareg tribe , mousa al-koni , denied that his people were helping the ousted leader .	but he said that gadhafi and members of his family could be hiding in the isolated region , which is surrounded by mountains . "	they can even build up a small city -- or a small country -- in this area without anybody really realizing , " al-koni said .	al-koni also claimed that gadhafi sent his son khamis to this area in july to set up a radio station and make preparations in case the regime had to flee .	there also have been suggestions that gadhafi may have fled through libya 's southern border to a hospitable regime elsewhere .	gadhafi had close ties with president hugo chavez of venezuela and saudi arabia has a history of hosting ousted leaders .	african countries also have been named .	the toppled dictator had in recent years shifted his attention from the arab world to using his oil wealth to gain influence within african union countries .	but many libyans believe he remains in the country . "	gadhafi would ... want to rely on trusted networks of tribal and ethnic support for movement and concealment , something which would get harder if he crossed any of the land borders , " said shashank joshi of the royal united services institute , a london-based think tank .	gadhafi 's remaining support in libya is strongest in the cities of sirte and bani walid , where forces loyal to him are still holding out against revolutionary forces .	in recent years , he richly rewarded the tribes that lived in these towns .	sirte , a city on the mediterranean coast , is his birthplace and is home to his own tribe , the gadhafa tribe .	fighters stationed on the outskirts of the city were divided on whether their former leader might be inside the city they were attacking . "	i am sure he is in sirte , " claimed ismail ben sawd , a businessman turned revolutionary fighter .	another said that he had heard reports that the former leader was there but was skeptical that gaddafi would remain in the city .

bachelor 's degrees wo n't be available at colorado community colleges any time soon .	a house committee on monday killed a bill that would have allowed two-year colleges to offer select four-year degrees .	the senate had approved the legislation , which would 've opened the door for community colleges to offer bachelor of applied science degrees in fields like dental hygiene or mortuary science .	proponents argued those fields are n't taught at colorado 's four-year colleges and universities .	supporters also said the bill would provide students in rural areas better access to four-year degrees .	but legislators seemed concerned the state 's higher education budget could not support adding degree programs at community colleges .	an estimate on the bill 's potential costs was n't given .	lawmakers called for greater collaboration between community colleges and four-year universities to meet students ' needs .
dna evidence can be the turning point for a post-conviction appeal , but whether or not it still exists years later is often no guarantee .	a bill that has passed the house and is awaiting action in the senate would require dna collected in any felony case charged as a violent or sex offense to be preserved through the length of the offender 's sentence , including post-prison community custody .	in cold cases , where no one has been charged or convicted , the dna would have to be maintained throughout the statute of limitations for the crime .	under current law , there is no requirement to preserve dna evidence after a conviction , though defense attorneys can seek a court order to do so . "	people find it astonishing that this evidence can just be thrown away , " said lara zarowsky , policy director for the innocence project northwest at the university of washington 's law school .	rep. tina orwall , the sponsor of house bill 1069 , said she was indeed surprised to learn there were n't standard protocols across the state .	orwall , a democrat from des moines , had previously sought an 18-month moratorium on the destruction of dna evidence in some criminal cases .	the measure she introduced last year would have also created a work group to recommend permanent , statewide standards for preserving dna material .	it was later amended to remove the moratorium but still never came up for a vote in the house .	orwall said she and other lawmakers met four times for workgroups on the issue between june and january to discuss this year 's approach . "	at the end of the day , we do want justice , " she said . "	we do n't want innocent people in prison and we do n't want violent offenders on the street . "	zarowsky said most states have varying laws on how long to preserve biological evidence and that washington is one of several that do n't automatically preserve dna for serious felonies .	in washington , once convicted , defendants must file motions to have evidence preserved for use during possible appeals .	because preservation rules may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , or even agency to agency , zarowsky said there is no guarantee that dna evidence will be available for testing if cases are appealed .	she said that her group reviewed about 70 potential cases between 2011 and 2013 and found that in the 25 that would have been viable dna cases ?	including murder and rape prosecutions ?	biological evidence was destroyed in eight cases and lost in one .

republican national committee chairman michael steele rolled through new hampshire for a pair of rallies friday , though none of the top-of-the-ticket candidates he praised joined him at the events .	senate candidate kelly ayotte and house candidates frank guinta and charlie bass all said they had previous commitments that prevented them from joining steele as he brought his " fire pelosi " bus tour to concord and bedford .	instead , the candidates were represented by state gop chairman john h. sununu , who called bass 's challenger in the 2nd district , ann mclane kuster , " probably the most radically liberal candidate for congress in the country today , " and said he was confident guinta would " retire carol shea-pelosi , " using the gop 's favored nickname for 1st district rep. carol shea-porter .	steele spoke in more general terms , telling a small group of volunteers in concord that they ca n't expect others to do the hard work in the days leading up to the nov. 2 election to turn out the vote for republicans .

"	you look at some of the positions ( ayotte ) opponent holds on social issues , on economic issues , i would argue that the vast majority of new hampshire independents , if they really focus on that are going to think twice about voting for her because she is not what you consider the prototypical new hampshire republican , " plouffe told the associated press . "	she 's a sarah palin republican and quite proud of it .

"	i just felt very comfortable with her , " justin 's mom said .	there 's no minimum age limit for hunting in washington state , said dave ware , game division manager for the state department of fish and wildlife .	the main requirement is that a hunting safety class be completed , which includes a " field day " that requires a student to demonstrate proficiency in handling a firearm safely , he said . "	it 's up to parents to decide what the kid is capable of doing , " ware said .	hunting seasons and limits vary between different parts of the state and according to type of weapon , ware said .	generally , he said , the seasonal limit is one deer .	youth outdoors unlimited paid for justin to finish his hunting safety class , and arranged for several outdoor practice shoots over the summer .	the class was four days a week , three hours a night for two weeks , including practice at an indoor gun range with a .22 caliber rifle .	justin 's test results were the best of the 35 people there , his parents said .	when justin passed the class he received a special hunting license for people with disabilities , his mother said .	the gun he used in the hunt , a remington 700 , was donated to youth outdoors unlimited .	the $ 500 rifle then underwent a $ 6,500 renovation by aaron davidson of gunwerks in wyoming , also donated , to make it easier for justin to operate . "	there was no kick , " his dad said . "	it was like shooting a bb gun . "	the outdoor practice shoots involved firing at deer-size targets marked with the location of the heart , lungs and liver .	a large contingent accompanied justin on the hunt -- his parents , carpenter , her husband , her brother-in-law , and the crew for the outdoor channel .	the land for the hunt was loaned to youth outdoors unlimited for the day by a property owner near colfax .	a blind was set up .	after nearly two days of waiting , late the second afternoon , a three-point buck -- its antlers had three points on each side -- appeared up a hill about 120 yards away .	that deer then moved out of sight and a four-pointer appeared .	justin fired quickly and the four-point buck went down .	the bullet " went right through the liver and heart and out the other side , " roy ristine said . "	it was like , ' boom , ' " his dad said , describing how quickly everything happened .	afterward , " i was very , very happy , " justin said .	the buck was taken to a barn on the property to be dressed .	gutted , it weighed 163 pounds , justin said .	the meat is being processed at a butcher shop in ephrata .	the ristines are having the deer 's head mounted , called a shoulder mount .	both services are being donated .	justin gets to keep the clothing while the rifle will stay with youth outdoors unlimited for other kids to use .	justin wants to keep hunting .

arizona is one of a handful of states that do not have a lieutenant governor , but that could change if voters approve a proposition on the november ballot .	proposition 111 seeks to change the title of the secretary of state to lieutenant governor , making it more clear to voters who succeeds the governor in the event of a midterm vacancy but not changing any of the historical duties .	the proposition was proposed by the o'connor house project , a yearlong effort led by retired u.s. supreme court justice sandra day o'connor to change how the state 's government is organized and runs .	the legislature referred it to the ballot .	if successful , candidates for lieutenant governor and governor could be running separate campaigns for the primary election , then be joined as a ticket for the general election .	what would become of third-party candidates who are successful in the primary but have no ticket to join in the general is unclear .	secretary of state ken bennett said legislators would have four years to work out the details if the proposition is successful . "	i know the intent is not to disenfranchise anyone , " he said . "	and it would be found completely unconstitutional if it were done in a way that did disadvantage any candidate or group of candidates . "	supporters say the change would create " truth in advertising , " and ensure continuity in political platforms . "	we think that by installing the position of lieutenant governor , it just leaves no doubt in voters ' minds what the chain of succession is in state government , " said garrick taylor , a spokesman for the arizona chamber of commerce and industry .	numerous arizona secretaries of state have become governors with the death , resignation or removal of governors .	the most recent example is the elevation of republican secretary of state jan brewer when democratic gov. janet napolitano resigned .	critics , including democratic secretary of state nominee chris deschene said the proposition could create problems when a lieutenant governor is overseeing the election of his or her boss in a successive term . "	unless you describe clearly the law in a way that separates the conflicts of interests especially in close races , now we 've opened more issues as to the transparency , the openness , the nonpartiality of a particular election , " he said .	bennett said he is not taking a position on the proposition .	the idea of establishing a lieutenant governor in arizona is n't new .	the issue went before voters in 1994 , but it was rejected , according to arizona state university 's morrison institute for public policy .	fred solop , a northern arizona political science professor , said the economic impact and the duties of the lieutenant governor beyond serving as the state 's chief elections officer are unclear in proposition 111 .	arizonans want to know what they 're voting for , he said , and that it 's something that matters . "	this issue is more esoteric , " he said . "	it 's more about the organization of the government .	it 's a solution but we do n't quite know what the problem is .	voters are going to be concerned .	they 're not going to jump for this . "

a u.s. man must serve two years of supervised probation on a federal felony conviction of conspiring to smuggle fossils from china into the united states , a federal judge ordered tuesday .	the judge also sentenced rick rolater , 69 to pay a $ 25,000 fine .	rolater had sold fossils through two by nature gallery stores , one in jackson , wyoming , and one in avon , colorado .	under his plea agreement , he agreed to forfeit several fossils to the government , including a tyrannosaurus skull authorities have said likely will be returned to mongolia .	rolater apologized to judge scott skavdahl , saying he deeply regretted that he did n't apply his training as a certified public accountant to scrutinizing his dealings with sources exporting fossils to him from china .	lawyers said some shipments rolater received were intentionally mislabeled to avoid scrutiny from government officials .	although skavdahl accepted the plea agreement , he said he questioned whether the punishment was enough to get rolater 's attention . "	he knew better , but he liked the money , " skavdahl said .	federal prosecutor stu healy and defense lawyer pat crank of cheyenne both spoke in favor of the plea agreement .	healy said it 's likely that rolater will face civil lawsuits from customers .	healy also noted that rolater is giving up fossils including the tyrannosaurus skull , which healy said was an exceptionally rare and valuable piece .	rolater told skavdahl that the tyrannosaurus skull he was giving up was worth at least $ 250,000 .	the federal government has sought forfeiture of the skull in a separate federal court in colorado .	healy said after the court hearing that rolater 's agreement to give it up may make that case unnecessary .	the federal investigation into rolater 's operations began in june 2012 when federal officials received a tip that the tyrannosaurus skull in his jackson gallery came from mongolia , according to a statement the denver office of homeland security investigations issued after he entered his guilty plea in january .	the skull disappeared from rolater 's gallery after news reports that the agency had seized a separate bataar skull in new york , according to the homeland security investigations statement .	federal authorities in may 2013 returned the 70-million-year-old tyrannosaurus skeleton to the mongolian government .	the repatriated skeleton had been looted from mongolia 's gobi desert and illegally smuggled into the u.s. by fossils dealer eric prokopi , authorities said .	prokopi , who bought and sold dinosaur skeletons out of his florida home , pleaded guilty in late 2012 to smuggling dinosaur fossils into the united states .	he is awaiting sentencing in federal court in new york .	healy told skavdahl that the federal prosecutions of rolater and prokopi both brought the issue of federal prosecutions for fossil smuggling to public attention .	before those cases , healy said , fossil dealers operated with a " head-in-the-sand syndrome . "	they knew there might have been some illegality about how fossils got into the country , but decided that once they were in the united states it was all right to trade in them , he said .	crank said there have only been a few federal prosecutions on fossil-smuggling charges nationwide .	the status of the law in china and mongolia is unclear whether fossil exports are permitted or , if not , how long they have been prohibited , crank said .	houston lawyer robert painter represents the mongolian government in trying to reclaim fossils that have been smuggled out of that country . "	the mongolian government is very grateful for the cooperation of the justice system here in the united states , " painter said in a telephone interview tuesday .

"	the mongolian government installed the tyrannosaurus it received back from the united states last may in a museum in the capital city of ulan bator , painter said .	more than 700,000 of the country 's roughly 3 million people had seen it last year , he said .

a judge on new jersey 's highest court refused on saturday to stop a black bear hunt scheduled to begin monday .	the animal protection league of new jersey and the bear education and resource group had asked the court to issue a stay that would have stopped the six-day hunt , the state 's first in five years , before it started .	but supreme court justice edwin stern turned down that request in an order issued saturday afternoon .	it came a day after an appeals court refused to block the hunt , saying the groups ' claims lacked merit .	environmental regulators insist the hunt is needed to control a growing bear population now estimated at 3,400 .	a hunt in seven northwestern counties is expected to reduce the number by 300 to 700 bears .	it is part of the state department of environmental protection 's bear management policy , which the animal activists claimed was improperly developed .	the appellate panel , though , had found the hunt to be " a safe , legal and responsible use of wildlife resources , as well as a legitimate and effective means to control overabundant game species in a cost-effective manner .

that 's the conclusion of the latest attempt to find out if happy people live longer .	previous studies have linked happiness to longevity but researchers now say there 's no such scientific connection .	so while being sick makes you unhappy , just being grouchy is n't enough to make you ill or shorten your life .	the results are based on questionnaires from more than 715,000 british women aged 50 to 69 who were enrolled in a national breast cancer screening program in the late 1990s .	the women were asked things like how often they felt happy and how healthy they were .	nearly 40 percent of the women said they were happy most of the time while 17 percent said they were unhappy .	after a decade of tracking the women , 4 percent had died .	scientists found the death rate among unhappy women was the same as those who were happy .	the research was published online wednesday in the medical journal lancet . "	it 's such a common belief that stress and unhappiness causes death and disease but it 's actually the other way around , " said richard peto , a professor at the university of oxford who was one of the study 's authors . "	people should focus on the real issues that shorten their lives , like smoking and obesity . "	in an accompanying commentary , french scientists suggested that the results might not be the same in men , since " men and women probably define happiness differently . "	the researchers said the latest paper was the biggest-ever to evaluate happiness and noted it accounted for potential confounding factors .	some previous studies among older adults have found that women were grumpier than men .	peto said the pursuit of happiness is still worthwhile , even if it does n't extend your life . "	happiness is very nice , " said peto , who was relieved to have finished the study after two decades . "	i had some of it myself when i was young . "	but not everyone was convinced by the study 's conclusions .	hazel newton , 69 , said she believed having a positive attitude was instrumental to her recovery from a stroke several years ago .

here 's something target corp. is n't advertising in its sunday circular : the discount retailer is now a major donor to a group backing the republican candidate for minnesota governor .	and that 's not sitting well with every target shopper .	under new laws allowing corporations to spend company money on election campaigns , the minneapolis-based chain gave $ 150,000 to a republican-friendly political fund staffed by insiders from departing gop gov. tim pawlenty 's administration .	the group , mn forward , is running tv ads supporting state legislator tom emmer , the presumptive gop nominee .	the corporate money is flowing since the u.s. supreme court threw out parts of a 63-year-old law that prohibited companies and unions from donating to campaigns for or against candidates .	the decision , which came earlier this year , changed rules in about half the states .	but the change is so new that experts do n't have a good handle on the likely impact nationally . "	this is the leading edge , " said ed bender , who heads the national institute on money in state politics in montana .	in minnesota , where target has its headquarters and opened its first store 48 years ago , democrats are grumbling about the large donation , and some are talking about striking back at the popular brand .	a few voices are even calling for a boycott in the state , one of target 's top three for sales .	one democratic-backed group is reaching out to target employees through facebook ads urging them to sign a petition opposing the donations . "	i think target is making a huge mistake , " said laura hedlund , a former democratic campaign worker who picketed outside a suburban minneapolis target store on saturday , urging shoppers to spend their money elsewhere .	a target spokeswoman said the company supports causes and candidates " based strictly on issues that affect our retail and business objectives . "	spokeswoman lena michaud said target has a history of giving in state and local races where allowed , but would n't provide detail on those donations .	she added that targetcitizens , the company 's federal political action committee , has spread donations evenly between democrats and republicans so far this year .	political action committees contribute money collected from employees and shareholders , not from corporate funds .	target 's donations to mn forward ?	$ 100,000 in cash and $ 50,000 in brand consulting ?	slightly exceeds the total amount the company has given this year to all campaigns and causes at the federal level .	by contrast , individuals can give a maximum of only $ 2,000 to candidates under minnesota law .	emmer is a fiery conservative who opposes gay marriage , lauds arizona 's strict approach to illegal immigration , once advocated chemical castration for sex offenders and wants to lower taxes .	his profile contrasts with target 's moderate image in minnesota , where the company is known for donating to public school programs , food shelves and the annual twin cities gay pride festival .	three democrats , house speaker margaret anderson kelliher , former u.s. sen. mark dayton and former state rep. matt entenza , are running in the aug. 10 primary .	pawlenty chose not to seek a third term and is instead exploring a 2012 presidential bid .	although corporate donations are now legal , they could be sensitive for companies that serve customers of different political orientation . "	you 're never going to please everyone , " said elliot schreiber , a professor at drexel university in philadelphia and consultant on corporate image management . "	taking sides is only going to exacerbate the situation . "	mn forward is technically nonpartisan , but executive director brian mcclung , pawlenty 's former spokesman , said emmer is the only gubernatorial candidate the group supports .	as of monday , target was the largest single donor to the group , which had raised nearly $ 700,000 from companies including pentair inc. , hubbard broadcasting inc. , davisco foods international inc. and polaris industries inc. . "	we believe that everybody has the right to express their opinions and we 're going to run a fair and factual campaign , " mcclung said . "	our first ad is a positive ad talking about a candidate 's vision for creating jobs . "	the supreme court ruling left in place state prohibitions against companies giving directly to the candidates .	the money can go to independent groups supporting the candidates .	but individuals can donate directly to the candidates ' campaigns .	money from target 's top executives has gone mainly to republicans .	former chief executive officer robert ulrich , who retired last year , gave $ 617,000 during his time as target 's leader , most of it to the state gop .	current chief executive gregg steinhafel has donated about $ 25,000 , almost exclusively to republican candidates and causes .	outside the supertarget in roseville , on the site of the original target store , most customers had n't heard about the donations .	some were n't pleased to learn of the company 's new political involvement in the state . "	target usually has the appearance of wanting to be neutral , " said kevin enberg , a 50-year-old dad from arden hills , who said he visits target daily and wants to know more about the company 's role in minnesota politics .	he added : " you need to know where your money ends up .

a peruvian judge on friday denied a defense motion to void the confession of joran van der sloot in the murder of a 21-year-old lima student because the attorney representing him at the time was state-appointed .	superior court judge wilder casique rejected the habeus corpus motion on behalf of van der sloot , who is jailed pending trial on charges of first-degree murder and robbery in the may 30 death in his hotel room of stephany flores , whom he met playing poker in a casino .	van der sloot also remains the sole suspect in the unresolved 2005 disappearance of u.s. teen natalee holloway on the caribbean island of aruba .	casique noted in a statement that van der sloot had , in addition to the lawyer , been afforded a dutch-spanish interpreter vetted by the dutch embassy .	van der sloot recanted the confession in a jailhouse interview with the dutch newspaper de telegraaf , claiming it was made under duress .	the defendant 's lawyer , maximo altez , told the associated press that he would appeal casique 's decision to a higher court .	a criminal law expert , jose balcazar , told the ap that van der sloot can continue the appeal but " that will not hold up the case against him . "	earlier friday , the chief judge of lima 's superior court , cesar vega , told reporters that peruvian laws allow up to six months for murder trials .	but legal expert mario amoretti said that in practice , cases like van der sloot 's can last 18 months .	balcazar said the defense is likely to try to draw the trial out .	if convicted , van der sloot faces between 15 and 35 years in prison .
united technologies corp. is expected to post strong revenue growth for the third quarter , but analysts expect profit to be down slightly from the same three months of 2012 as federal spending cuts pinch the conglomerate 's military business .	the hartford , conn. , aerospace and building systems conglomerate is set to report its results before the markets open on tuesday .	what to watch for : chief financial officer greg hayes warned in september of sharp cuts in u.s. military spare parts orders that are hurting its subsidiary the helicopter maker sikorsky .	analyst cai von rumohr at cowen and co. said in a note to investors early this month that " mostly solid operations " and improved growth at united technologies ' climate , controls and security division , which makes heating , cooling and building security systems , are expected to help united technologies overcome a 50 percent drop in sikorsky 's military parts and maintenance business .	united technologies has said federal spending cuts will hurt 2013 earnings by 10 cents per share .	most of that has been felt at sikorsky , hayes said , and the impact could be bigger next year .	the helicopter unit has eliminated 400 jobs this year .	von rumohr said orders at united technologies in the third quarter likely reflected continuing strength in u.s. residential heating and cooling systems , united technologies ' otis elevator business in china and north america , strong demand for aerospace parts and maintenance , u.s. commercial construction and the improving economy in europe .	sterne agee analyst peter arment said in a note to investors in early october that the performance of united technologies ' climate , controls and security , aerospace and jet engine maker pratt and whitney businesses are expected to more than compensate for what united technologies sees as " bumps in the road . "	those would include a potential impact of the partial government shutdown on sikorsky and costs weighing on otis related to moves from nogales , mexico , and bloomington , ind. , to florence , s.c. united technologies has said it expects a charge of about $ 50 million this year for otis .	why it matters : how united technologies ' businesses perform often provides a view of the aerospace industry , commercial and residential real estate markets and military sales .	the asia-pacific region represented 20 percent of the conglomerate 's sales in 2012 and europe accounted for more than one-fourth , showing strengths and weaknesses in u.s. manufacturing .	what 's expected : analysts polled by factset , on average , expect united technologies to report earnings of $ 1.54 per share on revenue of $ 16.21 billion .	last year 's quarter : in the third quarter of 2012 , united technologies earned $ 1.56 per share , which included 19 cents from discontinued operations from companies it sold .	revenue was $ 15.04 billion .

workers are already laying track for the central corridor light rail line between downtown minneapolis and downtown st. paul .	the west end of the line will stop at target field .	the east end of the line will be the union depot in st. paul , and the renovation of that historic building has begun in earnest .	construction workers at the world war i-era union depot are literally redoing the iconic train station from the ground up .	they 're driving piles into the ground under missing parts of the station 's foot-thick concrete train deck . "	there were portions of the train deck that needed to be replaced , " said kevin dalager , senior project manager with mortenson construction . "	i 'd say we are using about 70 percent of the train deck .	but that 30 percent that we 're demoing , we 're now rebuilding . "	train backers hope to run commuter rail into st. paul from north branch and hastings , and high speed rail from chicago .	but that 's a longer way off .	in the near term , only light rail will use the depot , and it 'll pull up to the station on the street out front .	passenger trains have n't been on the depot 's platform since the last burlington northern zephyr pulled out of the station on april 30 , 1971 .	passenger rail had already been declining when the depot was built in the 1920s , according to john diers , a railroad buff who 's writing a history of the station . "	some of the railroad presidents did n't want to build a fancy depot like this .	they thought it was a waste of money , " diers said . "	and it turned out they were right .	because by the time it was completed in 1924 , the passenger train was already in decline . "	transportation planners hope the depot will mark a turnaround for train travel .	in the next few years they 'll be linking up buses , bikes , taxis and even cars to the depot 's train service .	workers are renovating the depot to accommodate those other modes of travel .	for example , they 're carving a section out of the old train deck to build a bus ramp .	the steps from the front of the depot 's facade have been torn off .	a horse-and-wagon era carriageway , which runs underneath them , is going to be demolished . "	and then we reconstruct it to a fashion where cars and automobiles can get through , " said dalager .	but the real restoration is going on behind the scenes right now ?	in the station 's cavernous waiting room .	generations ago , its windows were boarded up , the skylights were blacked out and the doors were blocked .	for years , the post office used the space as a warehouse for mail equipment .	it 's one of the grandest and most celebrated indoor spaces in the twin cities .	to ready the waiting room for the public again , construction workers have already evicted the pigeons from the skylights to start cleaning the blackened glass .	workers are also stripping paint from the historic window frames .	the windows are being removed and shipped to kansas city , mo for restoration .	escalators will be installed where stairs used to run down to the tracks , and architects are recreating the historic light fixtures that once hung from the vaulted ceiling .	crews are also cleaning decades of dirt and smoke from the building 's stone .	paint samples are being taken to match the original colors .	the work makes way for the successors to the drug store , ticket office and diner that once made the depot a hub of activity . "	when the building is renovated , we 're going to have all sorts of spaces that could be used for anything from coffee shops to maybe small business office space , restaurants or maybe even some artistic museum-type space , " said josh collins , spokesman for the ramsey county rail authority , which will own and operate the depot .	the refurbishment is scheduled for completion by the end of 2012 .	amtrak trains are expected to use the depot regularly by 2013 .	greyhound buses , and metro transit bus and light rail service will add service by 2014 .
on a frigid january day at a derelict military base outside beijing , nearly three dozen recruits take target practice and conduct evasion and extraction drills as part of preparations to provide security for the growing number of chinese businesses investing in turbulent regions of africa , the middle east and elsewhere .	the genghis international security academy is one of several bodyguard schools in china that offer protection for the country 's growing number of wealthy businessmen and women , but in its case , the focus is on the international market .	privately owned but with military connections , it currently hosts 24 men and nine women ?	down from the 48 who initially enrolled ?	on a highly demanding three-week course , overseen by former portuguese special forces soldier and veteran bodyguard marco borges , who does n't hesitate to correct their missteps with a slap or a kick .	recruits are drawn largely from the military , but also include former athletes , entrepreneurs looking for work experience , and even college graduates seeking to put a little zest into their life .	company owner chen yongqing says he wants to build the school into a comprehensive security service along the lines of britain 's g4s and america 's academi , the private security firm formerly known as blackwater , by providing escorts for convoys , close protection and other services .	the vulnerability of chinese businesses overseas was illustrated most recently by the kidnapping of four chinese workers in sudan 's north darfur region last week .

fire has destroyed much of a popular flea market in west georgia .	flames raced through the west georgia flea market in carroll county early sunday .	many vendors lost everything , but county fire chief tim dyer says crews managed to save about 80 percent of the market .	people from west georgia and eastern alabama have been visiting the market for years .	to many it 's known as the " dirt mall " for its open-air stalls .	vendor joe george tells wsb-tv ( http://bit.ly/plly7a ) that he and a partner ran a record store in the market , but they lost everything .	the county fire chief says motorists saw flames in the early morning hours and notified authorities .	the blaze shut down a highway and kept fire crews busy for hours .

the national transportation safety board will review details of a motor home crash that killed five family members , including looking into laws that allowed a 17-year-old to drive the 57,000-pound vehicle , an ntsb spokesman said tuesday .	ntsb spokesman peter knudson said the agency wants to determine whether the driver , who was critically injured in the accident sunday , was " legally able to drive " such a large vehicle and whether the applicable laws and licensing requirements " could have played a role in this accident . " "	this does seem to be quite an unusual circumstance , so we want to be able to understand all the issues that surround it , " knudson told the associated press . "	i do n't recall another accident involving a motor home with this many individuals injured or killed .	we have a total of 18 who were in the vehicle .	i do n't recall another ntsb investigation where you have that many individuals . "	the crash happened about 9 a.m. sunday as a large extended family and some friends returned from an annual motocross vacation in texas .	the kansas highway patrol described the vehicle as a truck that had been set up with living quarters and was towing a trailer .	the vehicle broke through a guardrail on interstate 35 in northeast kansas outside the town of williamsburg and plunged into a ravine .	the patrol identified the dead as tom kerber , 25 , of new prague , minn. , and jessica kerber , 10 , joy kerber , 14 , and james kerber , 12 , of jordan , minn. .	tom kerber 's wife , melissa kerber , 24 , also died .	the 13 people injured in the crash were all in the vehicle and range in age from 2 to 30 .	several had been released from area hospitals by tuesday .	the driver , 17-year-old adam kerber , remained in critical condition tuesday .	adam kerber has a driver 's license that would n't have allowed him to drive a commercial vehicle like the one the family was traveling in because of its weight and because it was carrying more than 15 people .	but the restrictions did not apply because in minnesota , a person with a class d license , which is the most common , can operate a recreational vehicle when it 's for personal use .	knudson said the ntsb will " will gather information about the accident to examine issues related to vehicle licensing as well as applicable laws related to towing and overall vehicle length . "	but he said the ntsb would not be sending investigators to the scene . "	we have a very limited staff of highway investigators .	... but we work very closely with the local authorities , and we 'll be able to get a lot of information from them about this , " he said .	it 's unclear what impact an ntsb review of the laws would have .	but minnesota house public safety committee chairman tony cornish , a veteran law enforcement officer , said he has no plans to pursue changes to the law on rv drivers . "	this was an anomaly , " cornish said . "	this almost never happens .	usually motor home drivers are an older generation and experienced at driving these rigs .	they are involved in very very few accidents . "	he said the huge cost of the vehicles causes people to take more care behind the wheel . "	i really have no interest in a kneejerk reaction to one case , though tragic , " he said . "	the worst thing we can do is think we can solve all the world 's problems with another law . "	his senate counterpart , republican warren limmer , said he wo n't rush into a law change either . "	we 're still in shock , " limmer said . "	i do n't think any state legislator is thinking of writing state statutes right now .	to rush legislation with only a few days left in the session is n't the most prudent thing to do . "	kansas highway patrol trooper don hughes said tuesday it was unlikely charges would be filed in the case . "	i do n't see any charges coming at all , " hughes said . "	we 're trying to do the right thing ... and give the family some respect .

florida senate leaders may propose cutting dentistry , optometry and mental health services for medicaid patients as they try to curb the program 's budget , which is expected to top $ 21 billion next year .	the emerging senate bill calls for making cuts in so-called optional services as well as increasing reimbursement rates and limiting legal liabilities for primary care doctors .	although the increased reimbursement rates would cost more , senators want to encourage primary care doctors to continue taking medicaid patients .	sen. joe negron , r-stuart , did not specify an amount , but said the reimbursement rate increase would be more than 2 percent .	the bill will require patients to make an appointment with a primary care physician within 30 days of signing up for medicaid . "	we 're only going to be able to fund essential services , " said negron , who chairs the budget subcommittee that oversees medicaid . "	my goal is that the medicaid benefit will be comparable to what a citizen in the private sector has , not worse and certainly not better . "	the senate will release its proposed medicaid budget next week , and it comes as federal health officials are trying to guide state lawmakers to save money by limiting certain benefits .	meanwhile , gov. rick scott this week proposed saving $ 1 billion by reducing medicaid fees paid to hospitals by 5 percent .	but scott has not released additional details for how he would reduce medicaid spending .	the house 's proposals are still being drafted .	florida 's medicaid program for low-income and disabled residents is projected to cost about $ 20 billion during the current fiscal year , with the federal government footing more than half the bill .	the cost is expected to rise to more than $ 21 billion next fiscal year , which starts july 1 .	the state is also dealing with a $ 3.6 billion deficit .	scott , along with other republican governors around the country , sent a letter to health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius asking her to tighten the eligibility guidelines so states could cut patients from the medicaid rolls .	sebelius said she is reviewing the request and instead urged states to find savings by charging higher co-payments for some services , limiting certain benefits and cracking down on fraud and other improper payments .	federal health officials estimate that roughly 40 percent , or $ 100 billion , of all 2008 medicaid spending nationally was on optional services .	they are encouraging states to find savings by limiting optional services that include hospice care , physical therapy and prosthetics .	states have wide discretion in their coverage of optional services .	they can eliminate a service or cover it only for targeted groups .	scott said he 's reviewing sebelius ' letter , but " doubts that there 's a lot of ways that it 's going to allow us to make a lot of savings . "	negron also said the medicaid budget has grown to the " detriment of education , " an assertion that has drawn criticism from health advocates . "	if you start cutting these services that are medically necessary , ( patients ) ca n't find it anywhere else , " said laura goodhue , head of the patient advocacy group florida chain . "	that 's something you ca n't get somewhere else ?	dentures to eat or eyeglasses to see in school .	they 're trying to make them sound frivolous and like extras but they 're not . "	scott and lawmakers also agree on expanding a controversial five-county medicaid privatization program statewide to save money .	critics say the program saved money because for-profit hmos delivered fewer services .	patients complain they do n't have access to specialists .	several insurance companies dropped out of the program because they could n't make a profit , leaving patients to find new doctors and navigate the red tape of another plan .	the senate bill would penalize providers for pulling out of the program by requiring them to post performance bonds .	the house bill will also require them to serve in both rural and urban areas to ensure equal access for patients , republican rep. denise grimsley said .

the best thing about the group home where cindy moore once lived was her friends .	otherwise , the food was lousy and activities were scarce .	moore was bored .	so , more than a year ago , the animated west vincent township resident moved to a place where she is more than just a client with intellectual disabilities whose basic needs must be met .	at camphill village kimberton hills , moore is considered a working artisan .

"	we provide a place for people to be included and to contribute , " said felicity jeans , executive director of camphill kimberton .	this weekend , the community is hosting a conference of 60 people from 11 camphill locations in the united states and canada to learn crafting techniques , improve skills , and discuss the therapeutic virtues of crafting .	craft communities believe there is " soul-building , healing power , and sense of fulfillment " in creating something from natural materials by hand , said thomas a. guiler , a syracuse university doctoral student who is studying crafter communities .	guiler will speak at the conference .	residents and students from the two other camphill communities in southeastern pennsylvania will also attend : the camphill special school in glenmoore , chester county , for youngsters with intellectual disabilities in kindergarten through 12th grade ; and camphill soltane , also in glenmoore , a program similar to camphill village kimberton but for young adults .	with kimberton , the three area communities make up a continuum of community for people with disabilities as young as 5 and as old as 90 .	the residents , called villagers , live in households with volunteers called co-workers , who run the house and help the villagers live as independently as possible .	some are on year-long assignments with americorps .	others , like herta hoy , have spent decades at camphill . "	it was n't so much that i had to earn money .	that was n't in the foreground , " said hoy , 70 , who emigrated from the united kingdom in 1961 and raised her five children at camphill kimberton . "	i just wanted my life ( to be dedicated to ) something worthwhile . "	hoy , who had trained at camphill communities in england , came to kimberton shortly after it was founded on property donated by the family of the philanthropists h. alarik and mable pew myrin .	pew myrin , whose father , joseph n. pew , founded sun oil co. , established the philadelphia-based pew charitable trusts with her siblings .	the myrins were proponents of steiner 's principles of organic farming ( biodynamics ) and education ( the basis of the waldorf schools approach of using play and hands-on activities such as knitting and gardening as crucial parts of a child 's development ) .	the annual live-in fee for residents at the village is $ 42,700 , but the majority pay what their families can afford , said bernadette kovaleski , camphill kimberton 's development director .	day-only programs are $ 2,000 a month .	fundraising and selling what the farm and craft workshops produce is critical , jeans said .	at camphill kimberton , residents work in the community 's bakery and cafe , which are open to the public .	they also tend crops including kale , beets , scallions , peppers , and eggplant .	they work and sell at area farmers ' markets and at the on-site community supported agriculture system , in which families pay an annual fee to support the planting and harvest , then get to shop for the produce - and sometimes pick their own . "	this is beautiful stuff , " said system member kathy mcdevitt of the fruits and vegetables tuesday before walking out to the fields .	down the road , moore molded clay in the pottery workshop while resident bill lewis , 56 , sat at a loom moving his feet on pedals , and using threads culled from worn blue jeans to make a rug .

"	last week , thegrio.com , a news website on black issues , reported that young african americans who may get census forms for the first time this year are offended by the government 's use of the antiquated word .	the census bureau says it has used the term on the form since 1950 and tests show that some blacks still identify with it - the same reason it added " african american " in 2000 , a time when a growing number of blacks identified themselves that way .	if testing this year shows that removing the term will not discourage people from responding accurately , the census bureau says it could drop it from future surveys .	more than 56,000 wrote in " negro " in 2000 .

the oregon legislature and supreme court have at least one definite topic on their agendas in the new year : finding a solution to the state 's foreclosure standstill .	the oregonian ( http://is.gd/vl2laj ) reports oregon 's new foreclosure mediation program was supposed to give homeowners one last chance at keeping their homes .	instead , it brought out-of-court foreclosures to a halt .	faced with new requirements and costs , lenders simply stopped filing new foreclosures .	the logjam was compounded a week later by an appellate court ruling that lenders ' recording practices did n't meet state law .	five months later , foreclosures are taking the court route , which is slower and costlier for all involved .	both the oregon legislature and the state supreme court will need to make some key decisions concerning the foreclosure process early in the new year .
the shelby county board of education is suing the state of tennessee , accusing it of failing to fully fund the county 's public schools .	multiple media outlets report that the lawsuit was filed monday in davidson county .	according to the complaint , the state has withheld funds and disproportionately hurt children in impoverished areas .	the lawsuit highlights hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts the board was forced to make over the last several years , leading to increased class sizes , fewer teachers , deteriorating facilities and overall poor-performing schools .	the board is seeking a judgment that the funding level is unconstitutional .	board attorney valerie spekman says the goal of the lawsuit is to change the formula used to determine public school allocations .	a state attorney general 's office spokesperson said the office was reviewing the complaint monday .

an inmate who was a teenager when he robbed and killed a davenport janitor in 2004 may get a chance to be released from prison , an appeals court ruled wednesday .	the iowa court of appeals vacated christopher langley 's sentences for murder , kidnapping , robbery and theft in the death of 53-year-old mark willis .	the court ruled that langley 's punishment of two life sentences without the possibility of parole , plus 35 years , has been rendered unconstitutional by state and federal rulings that limit lengthy prison terms for juvenile offenders .	the u.s. supreme court ruled last year that mandatory life sentences for juvenile killers violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .	the iowa supreme court in august expanded that precedent , saying it applies to lengthy fixed-year prison terms for juveniles who commit crimes .	the state court says such offenders should receive individual sentencing hearings where factors such as their youth and ability to change are taken into consideration .	each must be given a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate " rehabilitation and fitness to return to society , " but their eventual release from prison is not guaranteed , the court says .	the 26-year-old langley , who was 16 when he was convicted , must be resentenced in accordance with those rulings , the appeals court said .	scott county attorney michael walton said that he would likely again ask for a life sentence without parole , but he acknowledged a judge could opt to make langley ?	an inmate at the fort dodge correctional facility ?	eligible for release some day .	as dozens of juvenile killers in iowa get resentenced in the coming months , " we may get a better idea of what the realistic outcome will be , " he said .	willis had befriended langley in the years before his death .	prosecutors say langley and two other teenagers ?	then 18-year-old trenton howard and 16-year-old michael cargill ?	beat and stabbed willis to death and left his body in a creek .	they then stole his jeep and bank card and traveled to florida .	all three were convicted of first-degree murder and other charges and were sentenced to life in prison .	cargill has applied for a new sentencing hearing since he was a juvenile at the time , and walton expects it will be granted .	howard 's punishment should stand since he was an adult at the time of trial , walton said .	langley 's attorney , lauren phelps , declined comment .
archaeologists unearthing a biblical ruin inside a palestinian city in the west bank are writing the latest chapter in a 100-year-old excavation that has been interrupted by two world wars and numerous rounds of mideast upheaval .	working on an urban lot that long served residents of nablus as an unofficial dump for garbage and old car parts , dutch and palestinian archaeologists are learning more about the ancient city of shekhem , and are preparing to open the site to the public as an archaeological park next year .	the project , carried out under the auspices of the palestinian department of antiquities , also aims to introduce the palestinians of nablus , who have been beset for much of the past decade by bloodshed and isolation , to the wealth of antiquities in the middle of their city . "	the local population has started very well to understand the value of the site , not only the historical value , but also the value for their own identity , " said gerrit van der kooij of leiden university in the netherlands , who co-directs the dig team . "	the local people have to feel responsible for the archaeological heritage in their neighborhood , " he said .	the digging season wrapped up this week at the site , known locally as tel balata .	the city of shekhem , positioned in a pass between the mountains of gerizim and eibal and controlling the askar plains to the east , was an important regional center more than 3,500 years ago .	as the existing remains show , it lay within fortifications of massive stones , was entered through monumental gates and centered on a temple with walls five yards ( meters ) thick .	the king of shekhem , labaya , is mentioned in the cuneiform tablets of the pharaonic archive found at tel al-amarna in egypt , which are dated to the 14th century b.c. .	the king had rebelled against egyptian domination , and soldiers were dispatched north to subdue him .	they failed .	the city also appears often in the biblical narrative .	the patriarch abraham , for example , was passing near shekhem when god promised to give the land of canaan to his descendants in the book of genesis .	later , abraham 's grandson jacob was camped outside the walls when a local canaanite prince raped his daughter , dinah .	jacob 's sons sacked the city in vengeance .	the body of jacob 's son joseph was brought from egypt hundreds of years later by the fleeing israelites and buried at shekhem .	two millennia ago , the romans abandoned the original site and built a new city to the west , calling it flavius neapolis .	the greek name neapolis , or " new city , " later became enshrined in arabic as nablus .	in hebrew , the city is still called shekhem .	nablus has since spread , and ancient shekhem is now surrounded by palestinian homes and car garages near the city 's eastern outskirts .	one morning this week , a garbage container emitted smoke from burning refuse not far from the remains of the northwestern city gate in a curved wall built by skilled engineers around 1600 b.c. .	a visitor can walk through the gate , passing through two chambers before emerging inside the city .	from there it is a short walk to the remains of the city 's temple , with a stone stele on an outdoor platform overlooking the houses below .	the identity of the city 's residents at the time remains unclear .	one theory posits that they were hyksos , people who came from northern syria and were later expelled from egypt .	according to the bible 's account , the city was later canaanite and still later ruled by israelites , but archaeology has not corroborated that so far , van der kooij said .	a german team began excavating at the site in 1913 , with nablus under the control of the ottoman turks .	the dig was interrupted by world war i but resumed afterward , continuing sporadically into the 1930s under british rule .	much of the german documentation of the dig was lost in the allied bombings of wwii .	american teams dug at the site in the 1950s and 1960s , under jordanian rule .	israel conquered nablus , along with the rest of the west bank , in the 1967 mideast war .	over the years , the site fell into disrepair .	the neglect was exacerbated after the first palestinian uprising in the late 1980s , when nablus became a center for resistance to israeli control .	its condition further deteriorated after the second , more violent , uprising erupted in 2000 , drawing israeli military incursions and the imposition of roadblocks and closures that all but cut the city off from the outside world .	in recent years , with the western-backed palestinian authority increasingly asserting security control over the cities of the west bank , israel has removed some roadblocks and movement has become more free .	visitors to nablus are still rare , but the improvements helped convince the archaeologists that the time had come to resume work .	the new excavations and the establishment of the archaeological park are a joint project of the palestinian tourism ministry , the dutch government and unesco .	the project began last year and is scheduled to end with the opening of the park in 2012 .	in israel , archaeology , and especially biblical archaeology , has long been a hallowed national pursuit traditionally focused on uncovering the depth of jewish roots in the land .	for the palestinians , whose department of antiquities was founded only 15 years ago , the dig demonstrates a growing interest in uncovering the ancient past .	the department now has 130 workers and carries out several dozen rescue excavations every year on the sites of planned building projects in areas administered by the palestinian authority , said hamdan taha , the department 's director .	ten ongoing research excavations are being conducted with foreign cooperation .	all of the periods in local history , including that of the biblical israelites , are part of palestinian history , taha said .	digs like the one in nablus , he said , " give palestinians the opportunity to participate in writing or rewriting the history of palestine from its primary sources .

a polk county sheriff 's deputy has been arrested after authorities say he stole a dvd after responding to a robbery at a convenience store .	the agency says 28-year-old ernesto mccloud responded to a robbery last week to back up local police .	video surveillance shows him taking a dvd from the store and hiding it in his uniform .	he was charged with petty theft and armed burglary .	mccloud resigned after he was arrested friday .	he was hired as a detention deputy in 2010 and became a deputy sheriff last year .	authorities said he confessed to the theft and lamented throwing away his career for a $ 10 dvd .	a phone message for ernesto mccloud could not be left saturday because the phone appeared to be off the hook .
no money is missing at a troubled transportation research center at south carolina state university named for u.s. rep. james clyburn , a state audit released tuesday has found .	but the legislative audit council report also noted that the orangeburg school does n't have a viable plan to raise more than $ 80 million needed to complete the center , which was announced more than a dozen years ago . "	we did not find evidence of missing funds , but did find questionable expenditure of funds , " the council said in its report . "	scsu has identified only $ 27 million of the $ 107 million needed to complete the center .	although scsu lacks the $ 80 million to complete the center , it has begun work and has exposed the university to future financial obligations . "	lawmakers asked for the audit after years of construction delays , coupled with newspaper reports that school officials could n't account for millions in state and federal funding for the james e. clyburn university transportation center , announced in 1998 as a showpiece for research and training of workers in the transportation industry .	the university had $ 23.3 million in grants from the u.s. transportation department originally , but was not able to get the grant renewed in 2006 and also lost its designation as a federal transportation center .	a federal audit on one of those grants , the national summer transportation institute , found financial records were confusing and accountants could not tell where money went .	even with full funding , auditors said that the center would not be finished until 2020 , citing a lack of oversight and experience as the causes for numerous construction delays .	sen. robert ford , who led the request for the audit , said tuesday he 's extremely disappointed but hopes to use the report 's findings to improve the school . "	there 's nothing good in there at all ?	absolutely nothing good , " said ford , d-charleston . "	it 's sad it had to be done .	it 's serious , and it 's something we 've got to straighten out because we want south carolina state to be one of the best schools in the country , and we ca n't do that if we do n't have people properly looking out for the money . "	ford also said the $ 3 million in state matching funds that are still needed will not be awarded by the legislature , although it could be raised from alumni .	in a statement , university president george cooper said the school would carefully review the audit , which he said vindicates south carolina state 's position . "	the most important finding in the report confirms what we 've always known and said : there is no missing $ 50 million at sc state , " cooper said . "	we are committed to correcting the mistakes of the past , to reforming our policies and procedures and to moving forward to build a stronger university . "	rep. chip limehouse , a charleston republican who signed the audit request , said it takes a lot to lose a federal designation , indicating the extent of financial mismanagement and incompetency . "	the real losers here are the students and parents who paid their hard-earned dollars for children to attend a state university with a world-class transportation center as was promised , and those promises have all been broken , " said limehouse , chairman of the house subcommittee that writes colleges ' budgets . "	due to the colossal mishandling and mismanagement of this project , it is dead .	i do n't think it will ever come to fruition . "	the audit council planned to brief legislators on the report 's findings at 1 p.m. on tuesday , clyburn said he felt south carolina state was being unfairly bullied by people who did n't want to see the transportation center ?	which he views as a centerpiece to help attract non-black students ?	succeed . "	i saw this transportation center as a way to do that 13 years ago , and that 's what we did , " clyburn said . "	but those people who did not want this to happen manufactured all of this controversy , and it took on a life of its own . "
your charity program may qualify for state grant money if you drum up support .	who better to get in your corner than your state representative ?	endorsement letters are a common practice in illinois politics .	but one lawmaker 's alleged attempt to make a buck off backing a state-grant application leaves many questions about it , including whether it 's yet another avenue for politicians to line their pockets in corruption-rich illinois .	rep. derrick smith was indicted last week on a federal bribery charge for accepting $ 7,000 in exchange for his support of a grant application by a nonprofit set up the federal government in a sting , according to prosecutors .	it seems like an easy way for an unscrupulous pol to cash in .	the state seal and an officeholder 's name over a request seeking assistance is a time-honored tradition which embodies constituent service , the backbone of lawmaker life .	one government watchdog says the smith case demands that more light be shed on legislators ' literature .	but those who have dealt with grants for years say a written testimonial from a politician does n't carry as much weight as might be expected , and shrinking budgets mean state agencies giving out grants are returning to tested vendors with less need for outside validation .	there 's no evidence that smith tried the alleged scheme previously .	since his appointment to office last spring , the chicago democrat wrote at least one other letter of support for a grant , according to documents obtained by the associated press through a freedom of information request .	the charity operator who received the endorsement said she requested the letter and that there was never talk of a quid pro quo .	smith did not respond to requests for comment .	his attorney , victor henderson , said smith is innocent of the bribery charge and he was unaware of the previous letter his client had sent to the charity .	even if the alleged bribe had succeeded , there 's little reason to expect the overall practice could produce much return .	charities seek government money because they do n't have a lot to begin with , said u.s. rep. danny davis .	the chicago democrat said he writes numerous endorsement letters , including one that turned up along with smith 's in a stack of lawmaker-written letters for the charity that were obtained by ap . "	i 've never had anyone offer me a dime for a letter of support , " davis said . "	they come seeking support .	people do n't think of giving , not in my experience . " "	pay to play " nearly became the state political motto in the past decade , during which illinois watched as two consecutive governors were imprisoned on corruption convictions .	it 's not hard to imagine that somewhere in illinois ' long and murky history , at least one letter of recommendation has carried a price tag .	campaign contributions often are offered up from people who benefit from state money .	an ap analysis in 2004 of $ 29 million in lawmakers ' pet projects , tacked onto the budget without standard legislative review , found they went to groups tied to at least $ 2 million in campaign contributions .	that 's not illegal as long as there 's no direct exchange .	smith 's case should prompt easier public inspection of legislative correspondence , said brian gladstein , executive director of the illinois campaign for political reform .	any cause a lawmaker fights for by putting pen to paper should be searchable in an online database , he said . "	we need to make sure that fight is fought morally , ethically and on legal grounds , " he said .	just one letter of recommendation from smith showed up in responses to associated press public-records requests of two big state-grant distributors , the capital development board and the department of commerce and economic opportunity .	the nov. 30 , 2011 dispatch to cdb favors a $ 3 million grant to a social service agency in smith 's district , breakthrough urban ministries .	it 's one of a dozen letters , nearly all verbatim , from sources as varied as the local congressman , davis , and partner charity groups .	the missives are not evaluated and scored like other parts of an application , but are " an indicator that the proposed project has local support , " cdb spokesman dave blanchette said .	arloa sutter , breakthrough 's executive director , asked smith for his endorsement , but said , " never , at any time , did either of us have any conversation about money being exchanged or other favor . "	breakthrough is seeking the final $ 3 million it needs to construct a $ 15 million " familyplex " to house school programs for the low-income children it serves .	grants should be awarded by summer , blanchette said .	federal prosecutors have not contacted anyone at the agency , sutter said .	u.s. attorney patrick fitzgerald 's spokesman declined to comment .	congressman davis , who also spent years evaluating grant applications as a public schoolteacher , said he focused on a project 's quality , not who endorsed it .	but he knows grant applications require community backing ?	one reason he continues to churn them out . "	i do gobs of them , " he said .	smaller state budgets make who you know less of an issue , according to john porter , executive director of the american grant writers ' association .	with fewer dollars to give , more selective bureaucrats rely less on newcomers needing letters of introduction . "	states are sending out notices to organizations that are already qualified , " porter said .
the oklahoma republican party has removed a post from its official facebook page that said giving people food vouchers is similar to feeding animals in national parks .	party chairman randy brogdon wrote tuesday that the post was intended to illustrate the cycle of government dependency .	he apologized " for any misconceptions . "	the original message , posted monday , said 46 million americans participate in the supplemental assistance nutrition program , or snap , commonly referred to as food stamps .	the post then says the national park service encourages people not to feed wild animals because they " will grow dependent on handouts and will not learn to take care of themselves . "	the post concludes : " thus ends today 's lesson in irony . "	gov. mary fallin said in a statement she appreciated the post 's removal and accepted brogdon 's explanation .
a southern new jersey sheriff 's officer has been accused of stealing more than $ 1,500 from the police union he leads .	the atlantic county prosecutor 's office says 43-year-old john brigandi has been charged with official misconduct , theft and related offenses .	prosecutors say the atlantic county sheriff 's officer and 39-year-old amber jacobs conspired to gain unauthorized access to the police union 's bank account .	authorities say the pair used a bank card to steal more than $ 1,500 .	brigandi is the union president .	the hammonton man is free on $ 25,000 bail after his june 11 arrest .	jacobs is charged with theft , conspiracy to commit theft and conspiracy to commit official misconduct .	the north hanover township woman was released after processing .	it 's unclear if either have attorneys who could comment on the charges .
as ford motor co. and many police agencies turn away from the reliable king of cop cars ?	crown victorias ?	richland county deputies soon will be cruising around in 54 shiny new ones .	ford will stop making crown vics this year and replace them with a more fuel-efficient and cheaper-to-operate model built specifically for police .	while the columbia police department and the lexington county sheriff 's department are not buying more crown vics , richland sheriff leon lott elected to stick with the ford product , which has become iconic on the nation 's streets as well as tv and movie screens . "	there are faster cars out there , and some that get better gas mileage , " lott said . "	but when you look at overall performance , the crown vic is still top dog . "	the south carolina highway patrol also has purchased 85 crown vics in its first major purchase of cruisers in almost three years .	public safety director mark keel said he , like lott , would prefer to keep the vehicles and is not yet persuaded that the replacement would perform as well as the crown vics .	ford notified the nation 's police agencies during the summer of 2009 that it would shutter its canadian plant that builds the vics , which , for a while , have been sold only to commercial customers .	civilian drivers turned away from the street variety to sleeker , greener cars .	crown vics won the hearts of police around the nation because of their agility , reliability , safety features and toughness .	but good gas mileage is not among the car 's advantages .	they get about 16 miles per gallon .	it 's not just police who see the car 's beauty . "	crowns " have become popular among a growing number of young people in the midlands who like turning heads with stripped-down , retired police cars .	the trend began in the southeast several years ago with drug dealers who wanted to sit in the front seat of a police cruiser instead of the back .	a new $ 1.8 million shipment of 80 richland county sheriff 's department vehicles includes the 54 crown vics , department spokesman chris cowan said .	the others are 15 chevrolet impalas , three chevy tahoes , three ford escapes , two each dodge durangos and chargers , and a ford fusion .	the money is coming from the department 's share of a countywide bond issue .	the new rides will substitute for aging cruisers that have more than 100,000 miles on the odometer .	some cruisers have reached 176,000 miles , cowan said .	deputies are issued cars on four-year cycles in an effort to encourage them to take care of the vehicles , lott said .	the new cruisers will be doled out to officers as their cycles end .	lott said deliveries of the new vehicles are likely in late spring to late summer .	the sheriff 's department has about 590 vehicles issued to deputies and detectives .	crown vics amount to 250 of the total , cowan said .	that makes the fords , which have chased bad guys for a quarter of a century , the cruiser of choice in richland county .	the last of the muscular cars off the production lines also are being snapped up by police in other parts of south carolina .	the charleston and mount pleasant police departments have ordered a total of 60 ?	35 for charleston and 25 for mount pleasant , according to news reports .	north charleston plans to get 40 through a lease-purchase plan .	greenville police are buying 32 .	other upstate police agencies still are shopping .
after three months , gov. pat mccrory seems to have found his footing within state government .	the question is whether north carolina voters and republican colleagues at the general assembly will continue to like where he stands .	the first gop governor in north carolina in 20 years spent his first weeks in office doing what most new executives who transfer to a new city do ?	move into a new home , hire key staff , put out administrative fires and make a couple big decisions .	following a few public dustups , mccrory has now reached the next chapter in his four-year term to fix what he told voters last fall were north carolina 's " broken government " and " broken economy . "	his state budget plan and privatization proposals for managing medicaid and recruiting companies to north carolina represent his administration 's first major policy forays that legislators will consider . "	we 're working with a sense of urgency to fix immediate problems and implement long-term reforms , " mccrory said in an interview with the associated press before his 100th day in office monday .	he said he was focusing on improving education , government efficiency and the economy . "	i 'm trying not to get distracted by peripheral issues ... because i 'm trying stay focused on what people elected me to do . "	mccrory had no experience as a state official , instead getting his political experience as a charlotte city council member and later mayor for 14 years .	he persuaded enough state voters it would help him think outside the box or avoid partisan rancor .	so far , a significant chunk of the public remains satisfied .	an elon university poll showed 46 percent of residents surveyed last week approved of mccrory 's job performance and 25 percent disapproved .	another 27 percent did n't have an opinion . "	i think he 's done good job of using the first 100 days to try to acclimate himself , " said david mclennan , a political science professor at william peace university in raleigh .	mccrory took some heat for raising the salaries for his incoming cabinet .	his administration 's choice for running pre-kindergarten programs withdrew as it became known she led a group opposed to organized pre-k .	the governor also went on a radio talk show and referred to an " educational elite " and criticized some in the university of north carolina system . "	he 's had a few minor slipups , " mclennan said , but they have n't damaged him significantly .	political opponents are unhappy with mccrory for signing bills into law that accelerated the repayment of federal debt for unemployment benefits in part by cutting future jobless benefit checks , and refusing the expansion of medicaid through the affordable care act .	mccrory also supports legislation that would require voters to show photo identification , despite fierce opposition from civil rights groups .	six-term rep. deborah ross , d-wake , said the governor has criticized too harshly a public education system that includes one of the country 's best university systems , a model community college system and public schools with record high graduation rates . "	you ca n't say everything 's broken when we 've had the kind of successes that we have in this state and when people want to come here , " ross said . "	so fix the things that are wrong ... but spend some time learning about what 's done well and build on some of those successes . "	mccrory embraces interacting with the public and those who disagree with him on issues ?	a stark contrast to democratic predecessors govs. beverly perdue and mike easley .	he also travels outside of raleigh at least two days a week .	he dismisses his strongest detractors as unwilling to accept change . "	i think you 've got a lot of established interest groups that want to keep the way things are , " he said . "	i was n't elected to keep the status quo . "	during the next 100 days , mccrory will spend much of his time working with the republican-controlled general assembly , which can ignore a governor 's wishes because the gop has veto-proof majorities .	lawmakers are expected to pass a two-year budget and hope to develop a long-awaited overhaul of the tax code .	mccrory also wants his medicaid and commerce agency changes passed .	he holds regular breakfast meetings at the executive mansion with legislators of both parties , gathering their input .	house republicans seem to have the more friendly relationship with mccrory compared to the senate . "	if his boat rises , we rise as well so we do n't want to do anything that would make him look bad , " said majority leader edgar starnes , r-caldwell . "	if the governor goes down , every ( republican ) member of the house is going down as well . "	democrats said they 're unsure yet whether mccrory is going to ultimately govern from the middle or sign bills into law sought by tea party republicans or social conservatives .	that could make him look too extreme to voters .	as he did during the campaign , mccrory last week eschewed traditional partisan labels . "	i 'm governing from a pragmatic , visionary point of view , " he said .

a southern california woman was convicted monday of arranging to have a former nfl player kill her millionaire boyfriend more than a decade ago to collect on a $ 1 million life insurance policy and other cash .	jurors found nanette ann packard , 46 , guilty of first-degree murder in the 1994 shooting death of newport beach mogul william mclaughlin and that she committed the crime for financial gain .	kimberly mclaughlin , the victim 's daughter , clasped her hands and whispered " thank you " to jurors as they exited the courtroom in santa ana . "	this is in honor of my dad and all of the many people this woman has used and abused , " she told reporters after the verdict . "	it 's a lot of closure for us . "	packard , who wore a white sweater and had her long wavy hair pulled back in a ponytail , sat with her back to dozens of mclaughlin 's supporters in the courtroom .	her attorney , mick hill , briefly patted her back after the verdict was read .	a message was left for hill seeking comment .	prosecutors said packard was dating and living with the much older mclaughlin when he was shot six times in his newport beach home in december 1994 .	but the divorced mother of two was also romantically involved with eric naposki , a former linebacker for the new england patriots and indianapolis colts who worked as a nightclub bouncer , authorities said .	prosecutors accused packard of convincing naposki to kill mclaughlin , giving him a key to the victim 's house and telling him when he would be home .	she stood to collect $ 1 million on a life insurance policy and receive other benefits if mclaughlin died , authorities said .	packard ended up getting at least $ 500,000 from mclaughlin 's estate and by writing checks to herself from his account , said matt murphy , deputy district attorney .	on the day before the murder , packard wrote a $ 250,000 check from mclaughlin 's account and deposited it into her personal account , authorities said . "	in this case , we really had two motives : there was love and there was also money , " murphy told reporters , adding that packard filed a civil suit against mclaughlin 's family after his death in a bid to receive more cash . "	she 's a greedy thief who committed this murder for money . "	authorities long suspected naposki and packard in the shooting death , but the case went cold for years until police said they uncovered evidence that linked the pair to the killing .	new technology for identifying the murder weapon and the willingness of a witness to come forward were key to unlocking the case ?	as was the relentless investigation of police , murphy said .	in 1996 , packard pleaded guilty to writing checks from mclaughlin 's account without his knowledge .	during naposki 's trial , his defense attorney argued that packard was the only one who had a motive to kill mclaughlin , who had a successful medical technology business .	hill argued during packard 's trial that the football player acted alone out of fear she would leave him .	packard and naposki are each scheduled to be sentenced on may 18 .	both face a sentence of life in prison without parole , murphy said .

even after three years of raises totaling more than $ 9 million , professors in the university of wisconsin system still earn less than they could at comparable universities , according to a published report .	for example , full professors at uw-madison earned an average salary of $ 106,200 last year , but the median salary among 11 similar schools was $ 134,500 .	gannett wisconsin media reported ( http://gbpg.net/19jvx6u ) .	the figures underscore the challenge of attracting and retaining the best professors .	the uw system has been aggressive about offering targeted raises , and officials have been pushing the legislature for more control and flexibility to set competitive salaries .	but even with those efforts , the pay gap remains significant .	some faculty members are willing to accept lower salaries because they 're comfortable in their careers .	consider devinder sandhu , a biology professor at uw-stevens point whose base salary is listed at $ 68,000 .	he says he regularly gets offers that would pay $ 93,000 or more , but he enjoys working with students in the school 's plant-research lab . "	the salaries are way off , but there 's also satisfaction in this job , " sandhu said .	but while sandhu is staying put , many of his uw colleagues are n't .	a report compiled for a board of regents committee this month showed the uw system lost 1,182 faculty members between 2011 and 2013 .	the majority retired but nearly 500 quit . "	our challenge is not the number of people we lose to other universities ?	it 's which people we lose , and the resources ... they take with them down the road , " uw system spokesman david giroux said . "	it 's also a matter of which talented people never apply for a uw job because the salaries here are just not attractive enough . "	system officials have been trying to close the compensation gap with targeted raises , but the amount spent on raises has dropped in each of the last three years : from $ 4.9 million in 2010-11 to $ 2.5 million the following year and $ 1.9 million last year .	uw-madison was n't the only school with a substantial pay gap .	salaries for full professors at uw-milwaukee averaged $ 84,800 last year , compared to a median of $ 105,800 at 14 similar out-of-state schools .	and professors at the 11 smaller uw universities made an average of $ 71,200 , compared to an industry median of $ 93,100 .	aaron crandall , the president of the american federation of teachers local 223 , which represents about 100 faculty and staff members at uw-madison , said working for uw has historically been a point of pride for professors .	but such a large pay gap erodes that good will . "	eventually people will be like , ' i could really use more money , or i could really use more resources , or my program could expand if i go to this other university , ' " he said .

"	we do allow , for instance , some protests without a permit , " huss said .

dominic capitano is at school early because his mom needs to get to work .	kenyatta watson wants to be a better reader .	dabren vega is earning points for his " house , " the kind made famous at the fictional hogwarts school .	they sit in the historic auditorium in a tough part of east tampa , all in crisp uniforms and ties , arriving as early as 7 a.m. for voluntary reading .	john haley , the principal at franklin boys preparatory academy , is there for those who seek him out .	he wo n't take credit for franklin 's high test scores ?	or the calm , an almost otherworldly quality for a middle school .	once on a state list for possible closure , it can now be mistaken for a pricey prep school .	haley gives all the credit to his teachers , and to the hillsborough county school district for taking a chance and making it an all-boys school .	but it 's safe to say this father of five boys is franklin 's driving force .	in the face of an ongoing federal investigation spurred by an american civil liberties union complaint , he is convinced he 's giving boys something they ca n't get in a co-ed school . "	it is becoming men of distinction , " haley says . "	that 's our vision and mission for our boys .	it entails being a good citizen .	it entails being responsible for what you do and the decisions that you make , which i think is greatly lacking amongst men in our society . "	five years ago there was n't much to brag about at franklin .	the school spent three years on a state watch list because of low test scores .	in 2011 , a frustrated parent made her son walk around with a sign that said , " honk if i need education . "	haley was principal of madison middle , and that situation was n't much better . "	it was incredibly hard to get your lowest ( scoring ) kids the desire or even the willingness to engage with the curriculum , " he said . "	they would take no risks .	they would n't ask questions , they would never read publicly , they would n't even do the basic skills that the teacher has to get them to engage with in order to improve .	they did n't think they were safe .	they might be made fun of . "	in matters of discipline , haley instinctively addressed boys one way and girls another .	he worried he 'd appear inconsistent .	when he learned of plans to make franklin an all-boys magnet later that year , he was all in .	he wanted kids to take risks , share feedback , trust each other . "	it just does n't come naturally in the co-ed setting , that trust factor , " he said . "	there are just so many social issues and challenges to the boys and girls being in the same classroom . "	in fall 2011 , the district opened franklin and ferrell , a same-sized school nearby for girls .	both offered a college preparatory theme , after-school and saturday programs .	both provided ipads for all students .	haley set out to give the boys structure , consistency , caring teachers and current teaching methods .	today , quaint touches mix with modern technology .	teachers address students as " mr. , " while students perform virtual experiments on gizmo apps .	there is no hiding in nelson rodriguez 's science class ; an app on his tablet helps him call on students randomly to ask what they know about thermal energy .	one offers a theory .	another responds , " i agree with the first part of what he said , but . "	the aclu complaint alleges single-gender education is fueled by " junk science , " a belief that girls ' brains work differently than boys , ' which some researchers dispute .	the district says the science does n't matter ; the federal government approved the programs , so they can be offered by choice .	elsewhere , aclu challenges have shut down some single-gender programs .	the group also alleges flawed science is the basis for teacher training and marketing that tells parents , " girls have trouble understanding abstract concepts in math , " and " boys tend to need more movement to stimulate their brains . "	such ideas are hard to avoid at a single-gender school .	in the franklin cafeteria earlier this month , haley sent students who forgot to wear id badges to the end of the line . "	typical boy , " he said to one offender , an accomplished student .	student lucas blanchard said if franklin had girls , " it would n't , like , feel the same .	we do a lot of athletic things , so they would n't participate . "	in elementary school , " our whole class would n't go outside because the girls would n't want to go outside . "	colin peeler said girls " talked a lot and they took away learning because they always answered the questions before we did .	the teachers liked the girls more because there were more girl teachers .	they would do more stuff for the girls . "	uziel rosas said in co-ed fourth grade , girls laughed when he made a mistake and it embarrassed him . "	but with the boys .	i started getting more comfortable because if i did make a mistake , the boys understood . "	haley says he was not a great student growing up .	his parents , a doctor and a teacher , sent him to a private school in rural alabama , where he struggled .	thinking he needed a small college , they sent him to florida college in temple terrace .	it worked .	haley continued on to the university of south florida .	he taught social studies , coached football , moved into administration .	at franklin , he identifies with the nervous-twitching , elbow-swinging , sweaty-haired boys who walk , right side only , down his halls . "	my wife would tell you i 'm not a whole lot different from them , " he said . "	she 's got six boys , is what she 'd say . "	the teacher in him appreciates the need for discipline and order .	kids clean up their tables after lunch , one of many ways they win points for their houses .	they 're given myriad tasks to learn responsibility , from handing out ipads to serving as officers and mentors in their houses . "	i know how my father raised me and i know how i have tried , then , to raise my sons , " he said .	at franklin , " we 've got a lot of boys who have great dads .	but those kids have that as an advantage . "	my greatest satisfaction is seeing the success of boys who are struggling who do n't have that . "	he describes one sixth-grader who was teased for days by classmates because a female teacher intercepted the football during outdoor play . "	moshed by a girl " is the phrase he recalls .	there was a fight .	haley spoke calmly to both boys , and later to those who had teased the sixth-grader . "	those two boys looked at each other and they talked it out as young men , " he said .	as for the others , " i just laid it out to them , what they had done and the impact that it had . "	without being asked , all three apologized .	that was huge , haley said . "	they 're owning their decisions , their actions .	not a one of them offered an excuse .	if you can make that connection with a boy in that kind of situation , then the academic responsibility piece comes right in line .	they have taken personal responsibility for who they are and what they 're doing .	that changes your school . "	this is what happens when a guest shows up at franklin : boys approach you .	they make eye contact , shake your hand . "	welcome to bpa , " they say .	at haley 's home in rural plant city , it 's much the same with his sons , ages 13 to 21 .	the youngest , hendon , goes to franklin .	reese , 15 and in high school , went there after two lackluster years at a larger co-ed middle school .	the others are in college .	all five wrestle , and occasionally throw one another on the floor .	their mother , stephanie haley , stayed home with them for 15 years and now works as a nurse .	they all believe in single-gender education .	haley does n't think his students are missing out on anything .	they have female teachers .	there are events with ferrell .	he 's not teaching sexism , he says , but the outside world sure is . "	listen to the music .	look at the videos .	it is disgusting .

harvard university has doled out academic sanctions to dozens of students after a cheating probe connected to an open-book , take-home final exam .	the school implicated as many as 125 students in the scandal when officials first addressed the issue last year .	the inquiry started after a teaching assistant in a spring semester undergraduate-level government class detected problems , including that students may have shared answers .	in a campus-wide email friday , faculty of arts and sciences dean michael d. smith said the school 's academic integrity board had resolved all the cases related to the cheating probe .	he said " somewhat more than half " the cases involved students who had to withdraw from the college for a period of time .	of the cases left , about half the students got disciplinary probation .	the rest were n't disciplined .	some athletes became ensnared , including two basketball team co-captains whom the school scratched from its team roster .	past reports in the harvard crimson also linked football , baseball and ice hockey players to the scandal .	smith said in friday 's email that the school would n't discuss specific student cases .	the dean said a school committee is working on recommendations to strengthen a culture of academic honesty and promote ethics in scholarship . "	this is a time for communal reflection and action , " he wrote . "	we are responsible for creating the community in which our students study and we all thrive as scholars . "	staples founder thomas stemberg , a harvard graduate whose son is a student now , on friday criticized the school 's handling of the probe . "	if you challenge the entire faculty at the harvard business school and the harvard law school to come up with a process that took more time , cost more money , embarrassed more innocent students , and vindicated guilty faculty ... that could not have outdone the process that took place , " he said .	stemberg , a supporter of harvard 's basketball team , knows some of the students caught up in the scandal and his son knows others .	he wrote a complaint letter to harvard 's president in early january claiming that the professor who taught the government class changed the rules after several exams in which " open collaboration " was encouraged .	he alleged that for the take-home exam in question , instructions to students said they could n't collaborate with professors , teaching fellows " and others . " "	if the message was so clearly expressed , why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session ... if they did not get the message , could one expect the students to understand it ? "	stemberg went on to say that while some students " went too far , literally cutting and pasting their answers , " others only wrote answers from notes " derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged . "	the class was known as " introduction to congress , " and widely seen on campus as an easy way to get a good grade .	harvard undergraduate council president tara raghuveer said friday that the cheating investigation has been a hot topic on campus for months .	she said some students started the new school year without knowing if they 'd be allowed to finish it because of the lengthy period of time the probe took .	the 20-year-old junior also said there are a lot of questions about whether the take-home exam 's instructions were clear enough when it came to expectations about group work .	she said both students and professors are being careful to discuss collaboration policies now .	raghuveer also said the school community should make an effort to embrace the students who withdrew for disciplinary reasons when they come back to campus . "	the students who are implicated in this scandal from last spring still need to be recognized as members of our community ... they should n't feel alienated from harvard , " she said . "	this was an unfortunate incident .	students are being punished accordingly . "

alaska 's resurrection bay teems with salmon , herring and humpback whales , but when alaska sealife center chief executive officer tara riemer jones looks at the fiord outside her window , she sees a way to cut her building 's heating bill .	the center this month turned off boilers that burn expensive fuel oil in favor of america 's farthest north seawater heat pump system , which taps a summer 's worth of solar energy stored in the deep bay .	the system sucks in seawater , extracts a few degrees of its warmth and returns it to the ocean .	the upfront costs of the system were significant ?	about $ 830,000 .	but the sealife center expects the system to pay for itself in less than nine years , saving at least $ 15,000 and possibly double that each winter month , with the added benefit of keeping 1.3 million pounds of carbon emissions out of the atmosphere each year . "	it working just as it was designed and we 're getting huge savings out of it , " jones said .	about 160,000 visitors pass through the sealife center each year to see underwater views of sea lions and harbor seals plus rare seabirds and fish from all depths .	the center employs 90 people year-round and hosts volunteers and interns who help with its other missions , research and ocean wildlife rescue .	the sealife center is in seward , a city of 2,700 about three hours south of anchorage by car .	the city buys electricity from a utility that produces power mostly by natural gas , but the gas lines do n't stretch to seward .	homes and businesses burn fuel oil that in 2008 was selling for $ 5 per gallon .	at that price , the 120,000-square-foot building 's annual heating cost reached $ 463,000 , said operations manager darryl schaefermeyer .	a maintenance worker suggested heat pumps and schaefermeyer called in anchorage clean energy consultant andy baker to see if an answer to the center 's heating problems could be found in its front yard .	baker , who 's also an engineer , studied systems pioneered in scandinavian countries , visited four seawater heat exchange systems in canada and reviewed the latest technology offered by u.s. companies .	he found resurrection bay to be ideal .	the bay is elongated on a north-south axis and includes a 5-mile long area that 's more than 900 feet deep .	it collects solar energy all summer .	glacier melt adds a bit of cold water but it 's largely not flushed by ocean currents , allowing it to retain heat . "	the only place it loses heat is at the surface , " baker said .	the coldest water , 37 , degrees , is found at the end of winter in april .	a summer of sun raises that to 52 degrees by late october .	heating that volume of water 15 degrees would take 50 days of the entire daily throughput of the trans-alaska pipeline ?	600,000 barrels ?	burned at 85 percent efficiency , baker said . "	it 's staggering .	the sun does all that for free .	we 're just tapping a tiny , tiny portion of that , " he said .	federal and state agencies reviewed baker 's findings and offered $ 713,000 in demonstration project grants .	in principal , the heat pump technology is no more complicated than a refrigerator , he said .	however , instead of discarding heat like the kitchen appliance does , the system discards the cold and uses the heat .	it 's hard to think of 42-degree seawater as a hot medium but steam rising from the surface on a cold day is a clue to the warmth below the surface of resurrection bay .	from baker 's perspective , any seawater that stays above 35 degrees is a potential heating source .	the system works like this : seawater from the bay is piped to a titanium heat exchanger , where it warms a mixture of glycol and water .	the cooled seawater returns to the ocean .	the glycol mixture moves by pipe to a heat pump , where it comes into contact with refrigerant .	the warmed glycol mixture causes the liquid refrigerant to boil , turning it into gas .	the gas is run into an electric-powered compressor .	compressing the gas raises the temperature .	the compressed gas raises the temperature of another loop of water from 100 to 120 degrees .	that water is pumped throughout the building to warm ventilation air , preheat the hot water system and warm concrete slabs to keep ice from forming on pavement around animal enclosures and walkways .	the project only pays off if heat energy produced by the seawater system exceeds the electrical power used by the heat pumps .	the system has been consistently producing three units of heat for every one unit of electricity .	schaefermeyer sees possibilities for heating commercial buildings and homes in seward .	alaska 's panhandle and communities such as cordova and homer are also candidates , baker said .	the water off alaska 's largest city , anchorage , may not be suitable .	cook inlet is silty , baker said , and the water temperatures drop to 30 degrees and stay there . "	it 's really a bit too cold , " he said .	low-cost electricity , preferably clean hydro , is needed to power the heat exchange system , baker said .	the sealife center has a favorable industrial rate and also had the advantage of a seawater intake system for its aquariums .	there 's a fairly large capital cost and technical experience is required to design and run systems , baker said .	that may not be appropriate for small communities currently struggling to operate less complicated equipment . "	you 're probably not doing them a service by giving them one of these systems , " he said .	jones is happy with the results so far at her four-story aquarium . "	it 's winter and we 've turned off our fuel boilers , " she said .
discussion of the new courses is paired with proposals to kill the communicative disorders and athletic training degrees .	the two programs will remain concentrations in the allied health program .	the daily comet reports ( http://bit.ly/1qka9mm ) officials cited a low number of graduates , complications with future accreditation and low community impact for deleting those two degrees .	likewise , they cited a workforce need for the creation of criminal justice and computing technologies degrees .	the criminal justice degree was recently approved by the university of louisiana system and now faces review by the state board of regents .	the computing technologies degree will be reviewed by the ul system in december .	if the board of regents approves the programs , they could open up enrollment in the fall of 2016 .
the council bluffs library is celebrating the fifth anniversary of teen central , a place where youths can study and socialize .	the center housed on the library 's second floor opened in january 2010 to help fill a needed gap in providing an educational area specifically for teenagers , said anna hartmann , the library 's teen services manager . "	we 've held steady as far as the teens utilizing the center , " hartmann said . "	kids are still coming in .	it gives them a space of their own . "	she told the daily nonpareil ( http://bit.ly/1zqgoqt ) that teen central has increased how many programs it regularly offers since it started .	it began hosting between three and four programs a year , but now it holds about four a week .	the programs include crafts , trivia contests , reading and video game tournaments .	authors also have visited teen central to read their works .	the center is open seven days a week , and officials say about 60 young people visit daily during the school year .	around 500 teens participate each month in the weekly programs .
a plymouth state university biology professor has found the first ?	and maybe the second ?	woolly mammoth tooth in new hampshire .	fred prince was fishing in campton 10 years ago when he found and discarded what he now believes was a prehistoric elephant tooth .	it was n't until he started researching the animals and bought a partial molar from the netherlands last winter that he realized what he had found .	he vowed to find another , and that 's exactly what he did in april , searching for just a few hours about 2 miles from his first discovery .	a national expert confirmed that it was a partial molar .	such fossils are rare in new england , though a tooth was dredged from the ocean off the coast of rye last year .

by gene policinski ( editors : @note that the use of ( today ) or ( this week ) in fourth paragraph depends on your publication date .	if you publish on a date other than the week that includes 12/15 , please remove both references . )	under the first amendment , i get to say most anything out loud without fear of government interference or retaliation .	so i 'd like to say ... " thanks . " "	thanks " to our nation 's founders who , after debate over whether we needed a first amendment and nine other amendments that make up our bill of rights , finally agreed that we did . "	thanks " to james madison and others who found the right 45 words to declare for more than two centuries that government could not intrude on or deny our core freedoms of religion , speech , press , assembly and petition .	and " thanks " to the citizens who , in a process that reached its zenith on dec. 15 , 1791 - 219 years ago ( today ) ( this week ) - ratified those first 10 amendments that protect our core freedoms .	consider how first amendment freedoms have shaped the nation 's progress : freedom of religion - providing that government may neither favor nor disfavor any particular faith , and that we , as individuals , may worship or not as we choose - has helped spare this nation from much of the violence and strife over religious differences that still afflicts much of the world .	being able to freely speak and write about the issues of our time has allowed us - imperfectly at times , to be sure - to discuss , debate and determine our best solutions to some of the most vexing issues facing humanity , from slavery to women 's rights to civil rights .	and , coupled with the freedoms already named , being able to assemble with like-minded citizens and having the right to seek justice from our leaders has time after time allowed the oppressed , the ignored and the needy to bring their case to the court of public opinion and to the administrative and legislative halls of government .	u.s. supreme court chief justice john roberts , in a recent case , stirringly rejected a government claim that our first amendment freedoms might depend at times on their benefit to society . "	the first amendment itself reflects a judgment by the american people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh the costs , " roberts wrote .	we have these freedoms not because the founders or government bureaucrats granted them , and most assuredly not because a majority of us at any one time maintains them .	we have them as part of our basic rights as americans .	not that many of us can name those rights - no more than six of 100 americans could name all five in this year 's state of the first amendment national survey by the first amendment center .	the national initiative " 1 for all " - www.1forall.us - aims to change all that by encouraging our fellow citizens to learn about , and support , the first amendment .	considering that in many parts of the world there are people risking their livelihoods and even their lives to get some measure of the freedoms we have every morning when we awaken , we should say " thanks " for them often , and pledge to know them at least .	this is a good day to get started on both .	gene policinski is vice president and executive director of the first amendment center , 555 pennsylvania ave. , washington , d.c. , 20001 .	e-mail : gpolicinski ( at ) fac.org .

alabama attorney general troy king said thursday he plans to sue bp plc , seeking tax revenue lost because of the impact of the gulf oil spill on businesses and to recoup any state money spent on the cleanup .	king criticized the job bp and claims administrator kenneth feinberg have done in resolving claims .	he did not have a timetable for filing the lawsuit or indicate how much money the state would seek . "	make no mistake ?	we will be ready and we will pursue all violations of our state 's statutes and regulations and we will obtain complete financial restitution for all losses and impacts , " king said .	but a spokesman for gov. bob riley , todd stacy , said talk of a lawsuit " seems premature . " "	there 's no dispute that bp is the responsible party and there 's no dispute they are going to pay , " stacy said .	he said riley believes it would be better to attempt to resolve claims out of court .	king says the lawsuit will be filed by the alabama law firm of balch bingham .	the lawyers will get up to 14 percent of what they recover for the state .	stacy said riley has not yet signed off on a contract to hire the lawyers .	under state law , the governor must approve state contracts .	the attorney general made the announcement at a news conference with the two nominees for governor , republican robert bentley and democrat ron sparks , who voiced support for king 's litigation .	king said he informed riley 's staff of his plans but has not talked to the governor because riley is overseas on an industry-hunting trip . "	we need to do everything we can to make sure we get every dime we are owed , " sparks said .	bentley said the oil spill could have a devastating effect on alabama 's education and general fund budgets , saying much of the state 's tax revenue that comes from coastal activities could be lost . "	there will be budget cuts that will be necessary , " said bentley , a state representative who is a member of the house committee that prepares the education budget .	sparks had requested the briefing from king .	he asked that both candidates for governor receive the briefing because " i feel that it is important that the state present a unified , resolute position to bp . "	king was defeated in the june 1 republican primary by birmingham lawyer luther strange , who faces montgomery attorney james anderson in the november general election for attorney general .	king said thursday he had not briefed strange and anderson on the planned lawsuit and that he would not brief strange because " he has a conflict of interest . "	king repeated an allegation he made during the campaign that strange represents the oil and gas industry .	strange issued a statement repeating what he said during the campaign , that he does not currently represent oil companies . "	i have never provided legal services to bp or anyone involved in the spill , " strange said .	anderson said he would like to receive a briefing on the lawsuit from king . "	i certainly want to sit down with him and know what 's going on , " anderson said .	he said the legal system moves slowly and the lawsuit will likely still be in its early stages when the new attorney general takes office on jan. 17 .	king said he would have no problem briefing anderson on the spill .
the nominees hoping to lead south carolina 's public schools are set to debate monday night on statewide tv .	the live debate between democrat frank holleman and republican mick zais will air at 7 p.m. on south carolina educational television , two weeks after they debated on etv radio .	vouchers and early childhood education are two likely topics .	zais , the former president of newberry college , advocates using tax credits to help parents send their children to private school .	holleman , a greenville attorney , staunchly opposes that idea , saying it 's detrimental to public education .	the idea of using tax credits to help offset the cost of private tuition and homeschool supplies has divided gop lawmakers since gov. mark sanford began pushing it after taking office in 2003 .	various versions have died in the republican-controlled legislature .	holleman , who helped launch first steps under former gov. jim hodges , advocates expanding full-day 4-year-old kindergarten across the state to help improve students ' chances of success .	the legislature created a limited 4-year-old program in 2006 for at-risk students in certain districts in response to a court order in a long-standing education funding lawsuit .	zais opposes expanding the program and doubts the long-term benefits of starting school that young .	the 63-year-old took the helm of newberry college ?	a private , lutheran-supported school ?	after retiring from the u.s. army in 2000 as a brigadier general .	he is gov. mark sanford 's appointee to the state commission on higher education and the southern region educational board .	holleman , 56 , was chief of staff and deputy u.s. secretary of education under former gov. dick riley , during the clinton administration .	the job of education superintendent involves lobbying legislators , working with local school officials and directing an agency of about 900 employees ?	half of whom work in maintenance to keep the state 's statewide school bus fleet running .	the official also oversees teacher certification and training , curriculum standards , testing and meal programs .
there ( was ) no shortage of re-enactors at gettysburg 's 150th anniversary battle portrayal this year .	more than 10,000 signed up to parade around in wool garb , toting muskets and pushing cannons underneath a relentless summer sky .	but for many , this year will be their last battle .	and as the sun sets on gettysburg 's sesquicentennial , some wonder what will happen to their aging living-history hobby when they are gone .	a wooded area near the annual gettysburg anniversary committee re-enactment " battlefield " provides respite from the early july sun .	at the union hospital tent sits pete peters , known simply as " doc " to the soldiers he treats .	peters has been re-enacting for 50 years ?	including gettysburg 's 100th , 125th , 135th and 145th anniversaries .	he is a grizzled veteran of a graying hobby .	while the average age of a union soldier in the 1860s was younger than 26 , most estimates put the average age of a 2013 re-enactor around 40 . "	re-enacting has changed , " said the 75-year-old peters , a retired assistant chief for a volunteer fire department in whitehall , pa. " you 're not getting kids involved anymore . "	peters plans to make the civil war sesquicentennial his final campaign . "	it gets harder and harder every year , " peters said . "	i wo n't make the 175th or the 200th . "	primed to turn 80 in august , bob packard of lenhartsville , pa. , serves as an ordnance sergeant and peters ' chief aide .	he picked up the hobby when he was 68 .	how much longer does he intend to re-enact ? "	not too long more , " packard said .	peters would like to go to appomattox court house in virginia in 2015 to honor the sesquicentennial of general robert e. lee 's surrender and the end of the civil war . "	that would be the end of the sesquicentennials , " peters said . "	then i 'm gon na hang up my scalpels , saws and knives and retire from it .	if i make it that long . "	five decades ago , when peters started re-enacting , the hobby was just beginning to pick up .	at gettysburg in july 1963 , he and two buddies ?	now deceased ?	re-enacted in simple blue clothes .	authentic reproduction of uniforms or accoutrements did not take hold until around the 125th anniversary , peters said .	jonathan quigley , a 26-year-old from hedgesville , w.va. , who has been out of the hobby for a while , said there has been a split among re-enactors .	some people re-enact as a hobby , he said , while others are strong advocates of historical authenticity . "	there will always be hardcore re-enactors because they want to be accurate and do it like the soldiers in the civil war , " he said . "	there will also always be those that like to sit on coolers and drink out of coke cans while they text on their cellphones . "	andrea dimartino , media relations coordinator for the gettysburg anniversary committee , said that when the movie " gettysburg " came out in 1993 , there was a strong resurgence of interest in re-enacting . "	it looks like it 's still growing , " she said . "	but a lot of older guys are saying this will be it for them . "	at the same time , some younger re-enactors say they have trouble finding the time for their hobby .	adam stoner , 22 , started re-enacting 10 years ago , and he said he 's seen the hobby shrink as those around him age .	but he believes history moves in cycles . "	we 're not really bringing in youngsters , " he said . "	but in 50 years , it will probably look the same as it does now .	when we hit the 25 - and 50-year anniversaries , it picks up .	but then it dwindles down a bit . "	and when interest surges , there will certainly be a committed cadre of younger soldiers , those who grew up in families for whom living-history campaigns are a way of life .	jenn hulse is a 20-year-old re-enactor from pittsburgh whose uncle , allen baldwin , commands the union army .	hulse 's brother , jeffrey , 17 , started re-enacting when he was 7 . "	i was always a huge history guy , " jeffrey said . "	i 've seen all the gettysburg movies hundreds of times . "	when he was a boy , jeffrey and other children of re-enacting parents would stage their own battles , shooting cap guns at one another behind hay bales while their parents did living-history demonstrations . "	it was nice to see a bunch of 7-year-olds say , ' i ca n't wait to have a real gun , ' " his aunt , julie baldwin said . "	it was cool to see kids want to participate . "	like his sister , jeffrey hulse is not ready to admit the hobby 's defeat . "	it 's up to these older guys to get the kids interested , " jeffrey said . "	kids that are into history should get a chance to keep this alive . "	re-enactor josh withrow , 27 , said he has seen declining numbers of re-enactors through the years but figures there will always be an appeal for a re-enactment at gettysburg . "	if you 're enough of a history buff , just reading about it will never be enough , " he said .	but when he said he wants to re-enact for as long as he can , 59-year-old gib buckbee , a fellow re-enactor , felt the need to interject a little reality . "	you 're not married with kids , " buckbee chuckled . "	that 's right , " withrow responded through a sheepish grin . "	i 'm persistently single . " "	of course ya are , " buckbee shot back . "	because you 're a geek .	you do this . "
warmer temperatures and a possibility of heavy rainfall could lead to flooding in parts of ohio this week .	the national weather service says the danger for flooding will depend on how much and how fast the rain falls during a thursday thunderstorm .	meteorologists currently are expecting up to an inch and a half of rain in parts of the state .	any flooding is likely to hit northern ohio worse , where more snow is melting amid higher temperatures this week .	highs across the state will be in the 40s to 50s on wednesday .	temperatures will reach up to the low 60s in southern ohio on thursday ahead of the storm .	forecasters say the storm also could bring damaging winds and will be followed by a cold front .

a stony-faced merkel has lectured the other eu leaders about teutonic fiscal orthodoxy and the necessity of making profligate nations that helped cause the financial crisis feel the pain for overspending .	the 57-year-old opposes eurobonds that would mutualize the debt of all eurozone nations and insists on eu treaty changes to enforce more budgetary rigor .	at summits , she usually gets her way .	nicolas sarkozy france 's high-energy president faces re-election in four months and is staking his reputation on his handling of the european debt crisis .	the 56-year-old sarkozy is more prone to dramatic entreaties in public than the pragmatic merkel .	their styles clash , but their cooperation has been key to eu decision-making in recent years .	sarkozy has conceded to more of merkel 's positions in recent weeks as france 's own debt rating has come under pressure .	sarkozy wants closer union but opposes surrendering too much national sovereignty to eu bodies , a particularly sensitive subject ahead of april elections that he may lose .	david cameron british prime minister david cameron won the 2010 elections on a promise to slash spending and organize a referendum if a new eu treaty would move more power from london to brussels .	his conservatives failed to win a majority and he governs with the more moderate liberal democrats .	if a change in eu treaties is sought at the summit , cameron will demand protection for britain 's financial services sector .	britain does n't use the euro , and the 45-year-old cameron fears getting left out of decision-making if the eurozone makes its own rules .	but the difficulty of getting treaty changes ratified in britain could prompt a separate eurozone agreement .	mario monti the soft-spoken , professorial mario monti was warmly embraced by all european leaders when he replaced scandal-ridden silvio berlusconi as italy 's prime minister last month .	as a former european union antitrust commissioner , the 68-year-old monti has the credentials as the best possible politician to get debt-laden italy back to financial health .	he is in charge of europe 's third-biggest economy , and with a nation carrying euro1 .9 trillion ( $ 2.55 trillion ) in debt , many say he holds the fate of the euro in his hands .	beyond the summit , his major challenge comes over the next year when he has to refinance hundreds of billions of debt .	herman van rompuy as a former belgian premier and budget minister , herman van rompuy knows all about dealing with high debt and bulging budget deficits .	the first full-time european union president mostly brokers behind the scenes .	over the past year , the 64-year-old has largely gone along with the franco-german tandem known as " merkozy . "	coming into thursday 's summit though , he has been arguing for limited changes in eu decision-making to stave off the crisis , going right in the face of more drastic measures demanded by merkel .	he has prepared official proposals with european commission president jose manuel barroso to put to the leaders .	mario draghi draghi , the new president of the european central bank , hardly could have picked a tougher maiden summit .	basically , he has his fingers on the euro 's purse , and pressure has grown over the past weeks to open it far more to help out the struggling eurozone nations in a break with his predecessor , jean-claude trichet .	under the 64-year-old , the ecb has shown some initial signs that it could make a greater effort to save the euro .	hours before the summit , draghi took modest steps to help revive europe 's economy and financial system , including cutting a key interest rate .	christine lagarde the leader of the international monetary fund since july , lagarde knows the europe debt crisis and eu decision-making from the inside after years as french finance minister .	but she now has to keep global needs in mind .	the 55-year-old has had to explain europe 's woes to countries such as china and the united states , and balance conflicting views on how and whether to use the imf 's resources to help europe .	poised and with a ready grin , lagarde is the first woman to head the imf and enjoys the respect of many of the leaders meeting in brussels this week .

a real estate developer has asked for a southern indiana estate to be removed from the national register of historic places , claiming that officials sought the listing decades ago to block the completion of interstate 265 .	denis frankenberger of louisville , ky. , tells the courier-journal ( http://cjky.it/tiglfw ) he filed a petition concerning jefferson county 's drumanard estate earlier this month with register officials .	frankenberger alleges that jefferson county officials and the kentucky heritage council worked to expand the property that was already on the register for the " primary purpose " of blocking the continuation of i-265 to protect several properties .	federal highway officials have approved a tunnel beneath the estate as part of the ohio river bridges project .	indiana and kentucky preservation officials denied the allegation .

the obama administration was poised for a victory on one of its top foreign policy goals thursday as a senate panel appeared likely to recommend approval of a u.s.-russia nuclear arms control treaty with a bipartisan majority .	it was not clear that the administration has the votes or the time to get it to the senate floor for ratification this year .	hopes for passage improved this week , however , as a second republican on the foreign relations committee looked likely to support it .	as he opened a meeting to consider the treaty , committee chairman john kerry , d-mass. , cast the treaty as essential for u.s. national security . "	the stakes are enormous , " he said .	obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april .	it would shrink the limit on strategic warheads to 1,550 for each country , down about a third from the current ceiling of 2,200 .	it also would implement changes in current procedures that allow both countries to inspect each other 's arsenals and verify compliance .	the treaty has faced republican opposition , but it got a boost from a member of the committee , republican sen. bob corker , when he endorsed an amendment offered by the committee 's ranking republican , sen. richard lugar , that was aimed at building republican support for the treaty .	some republicans say the pact does not establish adequate procedures for making sure russia abides by its terms .	they also fear that moscow could use the treaty to limit u.s. missile defense plans .	many republicans also are tying their support to assurances from the obama administration that democrats push for more money to maintain and improve existing nuclear warheads .	democrats had earlier delayed a committee vote on the treaty as they sought broader support from republican members to build momentum toward final ratification by the full senate .	delays in negotiating the treaty and moving toward ratification have pushed consideration into the political season ahead of november 's congressional elections .	the white house and democratic allies in congress say there still is time to debate the treaty and hold a vote either before the elections or in the brief period after the elections and before newly elected lawmakers take office in january , known as the lame duck session .	the administration has held the treaty up as a signature success and a sign that its efforts to improve relations with russia have borne fruit .	failure to ratify the treaty or a long delay would represent a foreign policy setback .

dennis hopper , the high-flying hollywood wild man whose memorable and erratic career included an early turn in " rebel without a cause , " an improbable smash with " easy rider " and a classic character role in " blue velvet , " has died .	he was 74 .	hopper died saturday at his venice home , surrounded by family and friends , family friend alex hitz said .	hopper 's manager announced in october 2009 that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer .	the success of " easy rider , " and the spectacular failure of his next film , " the last movie , " fit the pattern for the talented but sometimes uncontrollable actor-director , who also had parts in such favorites as " apocalypse now " and " hoosiers . "	he was a two-time academy award nominee , and in march 2010 , was honored with a star on hollywood 's walk of fame .	after a promising start that included roles in two james dean films , hopper 's acting career had languished as he developed a reputation for throwing tantrums and abusing alcohol and drugs .	on the set of " true grit , " hopper so angered john wayne that the star reportedly chased hopper with a loaded gun .	he also married five times and led a dramatic life right to the end .	in january 2010 , hopper filed to end his 14-year marriage to victoria hopper , who stated in court filings that the actor was seeking to cut her out of her inheritance , a claim hopper denied . "	much of hollywood , " wrote critic-historian david thomson , " found hopper a pain in the neck . "	all was forgiven , at least for a moment , when he collaborated with another struggling actor , peter fonda , on a script about two pot-smoking , drug-dealing hippies on a motorcycle trip through the southwest and south to take in the new orleans mardi gras .	on the way , hopper and fonda befriend a drunken young lawyer ( jack nicholson , whom hopper had resisted casting , in a breakout role ) , but arouse the enmity of southern rednecks and are murdered before they can return home . " '	easy rider ' was never a motorcycle movie to me , " hopper said in 2009 . "	a lot of it was about politically what was going on in the country . "	fonda produced " easy rider " and hopper directed it for a meager $ 380,000 .	it went on to gross $ 40 million worldwide , a substantial sum for its time .	the film caught on despite tension between hopper and fonda and between hopper and the original choice for nicholson 's part , rip torn , who quit after a bitter argument with the director .	hopper was married and divorced several times .	his first wife was brooke hayward , the daughter of actress margaret sullavan and agent leland hayward , and author of the best-selling memoir " haywire . "	they had a daughter , marin , before hopper 's drug-induced violence led to divorce after eight years .	his second marriage , to singer-actress michelle phillips of the mamas and the papas , lasted only eight days .	a union with actress daria halprin also ended in divorce after they had a daughter , ruthana .	hopper and his fourth wife , dancer katherine lanasa , had a son , henry , before divorcing .	he married his fifth wife , victoria duffy , who was 32 years his junior , in 1996 , and they had a daughter , galen grier .

splintered remnants of oregon 's transportation history have been unearthed , fittingly , on the spot where a major road-widening project in beaverton is now underway .	contract crews late last month stopped work on a major widening of southwest farmington road , when their excavation machine dug up a half dozen or so largely decomposed pieces of earth-darkened wood .	further examination showed that they are time-worn chunks of the great plank road ?	the 1850s-era route representing the first link between the emerging town of portland with the fruitful farms and fields of the tualatin valley . "	certainly not something we see every day , " said kerry tymchuk , executive director of the oregon historical society . "	it 's a pretty remarkable find . "	in 1851 , a road enabling reliable travel between portland and its western breadbasket was important enough to area commerce that the territorial government chartered the portland-tualatin valley plank road company .	the company 's mission was to replace the often mud-splattered path from portland to hillsboro with wooden planks , tymchuk said .	using money raised from selling subscriptions to the public , a road from downtown portland began to take shape , traveling up through portland 's goose hollow neighborhood along a canyon created by tanner creek .	by the time work reached beaverton in 1860 , the route had been renamed canyon road .	users were assessed tolls of anywhere from $ 1 to $ 5 , depending on the weight of their freight , he said . "	back in its time , " tymchuk said , " this was the i-5 of its day . "	the discovery has created a definite buzz in beaverton , mayor denny doyle said . "	this serves as a reminder of what it was like here 170 years ago , " he said . "	it just makes you want to get a history book out and check this out some more . "	the discovery took place near the intersection of southwest farmington road and southwest 142nd avenue , project manager ben shaw said .	crews from k&e excavating in salem stopped immediately when they saw the scraps of wood . "	there was nothing salvageable because they were so splintered , " he said .	the wood likely was part of the original plank road 's underlayment , shaw said .	as for the planks themselves , it 's entirely possible that some of them are part of area barns still standing , he added .	at $ 24 million , the road widening dwarfs whatever was spent on the great plank road .	the project , a joint effort between beaverton and washington county , is scheduled for completion in april 2017 . "	it 's nice not to have to haul things through dirt these days , " doyle said . "	but to the extent that so much growth has headed out our way in recent years , it 's important to note that the plank road was largely the reason why . "

the search begins where a dirt road ends , in a forest festooned with vines and filled with the chatter of trilling birds .	this is the realm of jaguars , and a young biologist has made it her mission to find them .	emiliana isasi-catala wades through a creek and moves nimbly through the foliage , scanning the dark earth covered with fallen leaves for the distinctive round toes of jaguar tracks and the faint trails of smaller animals they prey on : agoutis , tapirs , peccaries and armadillos . "	a track .	it looks like jaguar , " she exclaims , while climbing a steep slope .	squatting to examine the swipe of bare earth , she concludes a big cat was moving downhill and slipped a little .	she speaks into her audio recorder : " signs of a feline .	let 's see if we find more tracks up there . "	isasi-catala , 32 , is carrying out the first study in venezuela to use cameras equipped with motion sensors to estimate the size of a jaguar population .	so far , her results have yielded an estimate of one jaguar every 12 square miles ( 30 square kilometers ) in the heart of this national park southeast of caracas ; that suggests about 40 jaguars in the entire park if further studies confirm similar numbers in other areas .	her search is driven by a sense of personal connection to elusive creatures that even when filmed remain mysterious and ghostly , just beyond reach .	she also sees a larger purpose in her research : helping the jaguars survive through the protection of a network of wildlife reserves and corridors across latin america .	jaguars are the largest land predators in the americas .	they once roamed widely from the southwestern united states to argentina , but have lost more than 40 percent of their natural territory and have disappeared from uruguay , el salvador and many other areas .	heavy hunting for their spotted coats devastated their numbers in the 1960s and early 1970s until the pelt trade was largely halted .	today jaguars are listed as a " near threatened " species .	they are vulnerable due to expanding farmland and roads that are carving away at their habitat , and conflicts with ranchers who view them as cattle killers and shoot them on sight or poison them .	no one has any good estimates of how many jaguars are left in the wild , and that is why work like isasi-catala 's is important .	in guatopo national park , she often comes upon the stumps of trees felled by illegal loggers and the camps of poachers who hunt animals that are prey for jaguars .	she saw national guard troops arrest three hunters carrying shotguns , and suspects hunters or loggers were to blame for stealing one of her cameras .	in spite of the problems , she is encouraged that a healthy number of jaguars remains in the park , and if this " umbrella species " at the top of the food chain is alive and well , it is a good sign the rest of the ecosystem is intact . "	her work is very valuable , " said rafael hoogesteijn , a venezuelan veterinarian and jaguar expert who works in brazil for the organization panthera , dedicated to saving wild cats , and who focuses on strategies for preventing jaguars from preying on cattle .	he said that besides her groundbreaking work documenting jaguars , isasi-catala also is gathering a wealth of information about their prey in a park that is a crossroads for wildlife . "	it is a very important area for jaguar conservation , " he said .	one day in july , isasi-catala is hiking to the top of a ridge to check an infrared camera set up to capture video and photographs of any passing jaguar .	she plots a course using a gps she wears around her neck , and three park rangers swing machetes to clear a path .	checking the camera that she strapped to a tree one month earlier , she finds it recorded only a small number of videos ?	she later sees they were images of tapirs ?	and decides to move the camera to another tree nearby where the ground is covered with tracks of deer and armadillos .	she aims the camera using a red laser pointer and activates it .	the motion sensor will trigger filming whenever anything passes , day or night .	her study is the focus of her doctoral thesis at simon bolivar university .	she has done her research on a shoestring budget , gathering donated cameras and buying others with her own money .	she relies on her father to drive her research volunteers in an old , battered range rover , and works late nights writing up results and browsing her video clips , rarely finding a jaguar .	hiking up to 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) a day in the mountainous park , she takes little notice of the swarms of mosquitoes or the ticks that latch onto her body .	in december , she finally got her first big reward when she checked the memory card of one camera .	browsing through the black-and-white videos on her laptop , she saw a spotted neck and back glide across the bottom of the frame , and she shouted with joy .	each jaguar 's pattern of spots is unique , identifiable like a fingerprint .	the same male jaguar later reappeared in another video curiously sniffing the camera and then peering directly into the lens . "	they 're magical , you know , " she says . "	when you see a jaguar , even if it 's in a photo , it gives you a sense of greatness .	that 's when you say , nature definitely is incredible . "	she named that first animal " tobe , " which means jaguar in the warao indian language .	three others that appeared later ?	maro , kaikuse and paneme ?	were named in other indigenous languages .	cat researchers sometimes use perfume to attract passing felines .	isasi-catala uses perfumes factory " chanel . "	she douses a piece of cotton , places it in a jar with holes punched in the lid , and tapes it to a tree .	the scent seems to make some cats pause .	but when the last of the four jaguars , paneme , appeared in a fog-like haze , apparently after a rainstorm , she reared up to sniff the perfume and retreated , baring her teeth .	much of the frenzy that followed was not captured on camera .	the jaguar attacked the perfume jar and a video camera , which was left hanging at an odd angle with claw marks on the duct tape .	the jaguar also destroyed an older still-photo camera , pulling it apart and exposing the film .	isasi-catala suspects the cameras and the scent of perfume set off the cat , and that she may have been aggressive because she was pregnant .	the cameras have captured images of a wide variety of animals , including five other smaller cat species found in venezuela , from an ocelot to a jaguarundi to a puma .	during her expeditions , isasi-catala has also learned to identify many signs : the odor of urine , claw marks on fallen trees , exposed earth where cats rake both front paws to mark their territory .	park ranger habi veroes , who has worked with her on the project , has showed her how to distinguish the territorial scrapings of a jaguar from those of a puma , or cougar .	she often tells veroes that she dreams one day people will drive through guatopo national park and see big signs declaring it a jaguar refuge .	the 37-year-old park ranger is a rarity : someone who has actually seen a jaguar face to face .	veroes recalls that he froze and leapt back when the jaguar lifted its head and stared at him with a penetrating gaze , then vanished .	jaguars have long been sacred creatures and totems in the indigenous myths of latin america , feared and revered as volatile spirits , gods or symbols of nature 's power .	the ancient mayans adorned temples with carved images of jaguars .	in some indigenous cultures , it is traditionally said that a shaman 's spirit can transform into a jaguar .	venezuelans typically call the animals " tigres , " or tigers .	they feature prominently as fearsome characters in folk tales told to children , and images of them are immortalized in murals on city walls .	yet for most , jaguars seem distant or nonexistent .	some people who live near the park find isasi-catala 's work curious and have taken to calling her " la tigrera , " or " the tiger lady . "	she says it is time people rediscover a sense of awe at jaguars , especially because they are under threat .	across latin america , the organization panthera is promoting the establishment of a " jaguar corridor , " a network of pathways used by the cats to roam between wilderness sanctuaries .	experts view the project as critical to guarantee the genetic mixing essential to preserving the species .	the best hope of saving jaguars is through working with governments and local people to recognize their paths , said alan rabinowitz , a zoologist who is president and ceo of new york-based panthera and whose research in belize in the 1980s led to the creation of the world 's first jaguar preserve . "	every place throughout their range i go , they 're still being shot and their habitat is still being fragmented , " rabinowitz said . "	every place i go and look for them , they are at risk . "	researchers have been using camera traps for surveys in places from brazil to mexico , and last year one image captured a jaguar ?	they are powerful swimmers ?	on barro colorado island in a lake in the panama canal .	on her daylong hike , isasi-catala does not positively identify a single track .	but that does not discourage her ; she knows the jaguars are here .	she is thrilled by the thought that at any given moment , a jaguar might be peering at her silently through the trees .
university of florida 's new president is set to become the highest-paid of the state 's public university chief , nearly doubling the base salary of most others at more than $ 1 million .	w. kent fuchs is coming from cornell university where he served as provost .	he will make about $ 1,040,000 per year in base salary and an annual deferred payment .	the gainesville sun reports ( http://bit.ly/1xoma1t ) that fuchs ' pay dwarfs outgoing president bernie machen 's $ 730,000 annual compensation , but brings florida 's president 's earnings in line with other elite universities .	the higher pay reflects the expectations of a new generation of university leaders , said board of trustees chair steve scott .	the university looked at 12 other schools in the association of american universities including ohio state , penn state , harvard and northwestern , where the average presidential pay ranged from $ 907,000 to $ 1.4 million .	florida state university 's new president , john thrasher , would be paid about $ 530,000 in base salary and performance bonuses .	about $ 200,000 of fuchs ' pay will come from public coffers , according to state law , with the rest raised through private donations .	he will also get a raise of 4 percent each year if the school meets short-term performance goals , or less if it 's not meeting all of those goals .	fuchs and his wife will live in a new , $ 3.1 million , 7,500-square-foot mansion constructed for the president .	florida wants to become a top 10 public university in the u.s. currently it ranks no. 14 on the u.s. news and world report rankings of best public colleges .

can you be famous if no one knows your name ?	a new band of hackers is giving it its best shot , trumpeting its cyber-capers in an all-sirens-flashing publicity campaign .	lulz security has stolen mountains of personal data in a dozen different hacks , embarrassing law enforcement on both sides of the atlantic while boasting about the stunts online .	the group , whose name draws on internetspeak for " laughs , " has about 270,000 followers on the messaging site twitter .	although lulzsec has declined interview requests , it has laid out its prankster philosophy in " tweets " and press releases . "	vigilantes ?	nope .	cyber terrorists ?	nope .	we have no political motives ?	we do it for the lulz , " the group said in a message sent shortly after it emerged in early may .	lulzsec 's twitter mascot is a black-and-white cartoon dandy that looks like a cross between mr. peanut and the new yorker magazine 's monocle man .	its rambling messages are peppered with references to youtube sensation rebecca black , the dungeons and dragons role playing game and tongue-in-cheek conspiracy theory .	one of lulzsec 's victims says the group sets itself apart from the rest of the hacker underground with its posturing and bragging on twitter . "	most of the hacker groups that are pretty well known out there ... do n't really like to flaunt their findings .	they 'll do it among their peers , but not typically the public , " said karim hijazi , a security expert whose emails were ransacked by the hacking group last month .	lulzsec made its name by defacing the site of the u.s. public broadcasting service , or pbs , with an article claiming that rapper tupac shakur was still alive .	it has since claimed hacks on major entertainment companies , fbi partner organizations , a pornography website and the arizona department of public safety , whose documents were leaked to the web late thursday .	many attacks have yielded sensitive information including usernames and passwords ?	nearly 38,000 of them , in the case of sony pictures .	others appear to have been just for kicks .	in a stunt last week , lulzsec directed hundreds of telephone calls to the customer service line of magnets.com , a new jersey-based manufacturer of custom refrigerator magnets .	lulzsec uses a similar technique to temporarily bring down websites , flooding them with bogus internet traffic .	this is an old hacker standby that does n't require much sophistication .	members also break in to sites to steal data .	that requires more skill and often involves duping employees into revealing passwords .	lulzsec 's actions against government and corporate websites are reminiscent of those taken by the much larger , more amorphous group known as anonymous .	that group has launched internet campaigns against the music industry , the church of scientology , and middle eastern dictatorships , among others .	both are fiercely protective of the secret-busting site wikileaks .	the hacking groups ' supporters share the same brand of offbeat humor inspired by internet catchphrases and viral videos .	lulzsec has repeatedly insisted on its independence . "	we 're not anonops , anonymous , a splinter group of anonymous , or even an affiliate of anonymous , " the group has said . "	we 're lulzsec . "	an anonymous member told the associated press that he believed lulzsec was formed by people from anonymous who got tired of the time it took to reach consensus and launch hacking projects .	he said that they also wanted to go beyond the ethical boundaries of anonymous . "	they wanted to go on more adventurous , brazen hacking adventures and really get their names out there , " he said .	he spoke on condition that his name is withheld given the pressure being put on anonymous members by law enforcement .	judging by the timing of its tweets and other communications , he believes that lulzsec is based mainly in the eastern half of the u.s. , but a few members are european .	the number of members is not known , but there appears to be no more than a handful , perhaps a dozen .	anonymous also uses twitter as a soapbox , but more as a way of recruiting helpers than publicizing its exploits .	it 's also been more selective about its targets .	it attacked the egyptian ministry of information 's website during the revolution in the country , but has shied away from leaks of ordinary user information , for example .	there 's every sign authorities are paying attention to the new group , although it is n't clear how much progress they 've made in tracking the hackers down .	on tuesday , 19-year-old ryan cleary was arrested as part of a joint fbi-scotland yard investigation into hackings linked to both lulzsec and anonymous .	british police commissioner paul stephenson described cleary 's arrest as " very significant , " although lulzsec has shrugged off the development ?	and promised more spectacular hacks .	the anonymous member believes law enforcement has little chance of finding lulzsec .	he told the ap that lulzsec likely used such methods as logging on only from public wi-fi hotspots .	police could possibly trace the attacks to the hotspot , but by the time they get there , any hacker would be long gone .	hijazi believes lulzsec harassed him because his firm , unveillance , tracks " botnets " ?	clusters of computers that can be controlled remotely because they 've been infected with malicious software .	the botnets , each of which can have more than a million computers , are usually controlled by cybercrime gangs .	he speculates that lulzsec wants botnets because it would boost its power to bring down websites .	but the group would be stepping on the toes of some very dangerous people if members started taking over botnets , he said . "	it 's going to make everyone really mad , both the good guys and some really big bad guys , " he said . "	i hope law enforcement finds them first . "

former north carolina gov. mike easley agreed to pay a $ 1,000 fine tuesday for a single campaign finance violation , ending investigations by state and federal prosecutors who spent more than a year combing through his professional and personal life .	easley , a former prosecutor who served as governor from 2001 to 2009 , entered an alford plea in wake county court , which means he acknowledged the state 's evidence stemming from a 2006 helicopter trip could result in a conviction without having to admit any guilt .	prosecutors said the state plea also ends a federal probe that started in february 2009 , a month after he left office due to term limits .	before the judge ruled on the plea agreement , easley said he took responsibility for the violation . "	as the candidate , i have to take responsibility for what the campaign does , " he told the judge . "	the buck has to stop somewhere .	it stops with me , and i take responsibilty for what occured in this instance . "	superior court judge osmond smith agreed to the plea deal , convicting easley of a minor felony .	the agreement stems from the investigation by rowan county district attorney bill kenerly , who was brought in to examine the case after the state board of elections fined easley 's campaign $ 100,000 .	federal prosecutors had cast a wide net in their investigation , calling witnesses for a grand jury to testify about a coastal subdivision where easley and his wife purchased a lot and the hiring of former first lady mary easley at n.c. state university .	they nabbed former easley aide ruffin poole , who pleaded guilty in april to tax evasion in exchange for dropping dozens of other counts and working with investigators .	poole has n't been sentenced .
hidekatsu sato stands in the doorway of his gutted house and looks out impassively at the sea as it laps up against the harbor wall just a few meters away .	born and raised here , he went to tokyo to work as a plumber , then returned a few years ago to live out his retirement years . "	i came back here to die , and that 's still my plan , " the grizzled 73-year old said . "	i 'm not leaving . "	with radiation leaking from a nuclear power plant near his city , he may not have that choice .	jutting out into the pacific ocean on japan 's devastated northeastern coast , soma ?	population 38,000 ?	is a microcosm of the calamity that befell this country on march 11 .	like dozens of other towns , soma bore the full force of the earthquake , then was inundated by the towering tsunami that raced in behind it .	now , it is struggling to cope with the unfolding crisis at the nearby fukushima dai-ichi nuclear complex .	soma sits in the shadow of the crippled facility that was badly damaged by the tsunami and has been leaking radioactivity into the air and sea and has forced tens of thousands of people to flee or hunker down indoors .	local crops and milk are contaminated , and there are fears that the future may hold more hardship than anyone here has ever known . "	i 've never had much , and i do n't need much , " sato said . "	but i just do n't know how this is ever going to end . "	even without the concerns over radioactivity , it is hard to imagine what is ahead for soma .	its harbor , once a popular destination for sport fishermen and tourists , smells of death .	rotting fish are strewn across the one main street that has been cleared enough to allow emergency vehicles through .	clams and crabs intended for sale on what everyone expected would be just another ordinary day are mixed in with the piles of timber and debris that were once people 's homes , stores and schools .	sato saw it all . "	it was like a freeway , everything was moving so fast , " he said of the powerful wave . "	houses , boats , trucks ?	they all just flew by on the water .	i escaped from my house to a little hill out back .	we have n't seen anything like this for generations . "	but sato says it is what he ca n't see now that scares him the most . "	we japanese grow up hearing stories about the horrors of radiation , about hiroshima and nagasaki , " he said . "	we , as a people , have a special fear of radiation .	it 's just so mysterious .	it causes an irrational fear .	we do n't know what to think . "	shortly after the damage to the fukushima plant became apparent , the government issued an evacuation order for all residents within a 6-mile ( 10-kilometer ) radius of the six reactors , which provide a major source of power for millions of people in tokyo .	that zone later became 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) , and residents in an added ring of 6 more miles ( 10 more kilometers ) were told to stay indoors .	a flood of evacuees soon began streaming into soma , which is just outside both rings . "	we are now taking in several hundred people from those areas , " said katsuhiro abe , a soma city official . "	that 's on top of about 2,000 of our own people who have no homes . "	abe stressed that ?	as far as the government 's assessment goes ?	soma , which is about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) away from the nuclear facility , is safe .	radiation levels are below what would be considered an immediate health risk .	abe said the invisible threat bearing down on the city came as a surprise .	soma was reasonably well-prepared for an earthquake .	the size of the tsunami was more unexpected , but officials had been trained in how to respond if one hit .	the nuclear crisis , however , caught them off guard .	abe said the city is now ready to evacuate everyone again if the situation at the plant deteriorates . "	we are watching the developments at the reactors with extreme caution , and we are preparing for the worst , " he said . "	it is a constant fear that we all must consider , but we must do so calmly . "	still , he said the nuclear crisis has added another layer of complexity to a natural disaster that was overwhelming in its own right . "	if it were n't for the nuclear plants , we could focus on our recovery , " abe said . "	but we do n't know how this is going to play out .	people from outside are afraid to come in to bring us the supplies that we desperately need .	convincing truck drivers or others that it is safe now , right here , has been a big obstacle for us .	people just do n't want to go anywhere near the reactors . " "	and if we ca n't sell our produce , like seaweed and rice , we are doomed , " he added .	back on the waterfront , sato and his neighbors are mostly left to fend for themselves .	they have no water , no power , no gas .	they must travel to evacuation centers to get food ?	usually just one rice ball a day .	most stay with family nearby on higher ground at night , then return to the shore to go through the motions of cleaning up , though it is a huge task .	as a light snow falls , port worker mitsuyoshi abe stands out in front of his wife 's two-chair hair salon .	he has a cigarette while he considers what to do .	although the building is still standing , the damage was so severe that abe at first had no idea of where to start . "	now it 's all starting to look normal , " he said . "	i 'm getting used to the devastation . "	abe said his house is n't his primary worry .	it can be rebuilt . "	what gets me is that i feel we were sacrificed .	we are the ones living next to these reactors , so that people in tokyo can have the conveniences they are accustomed to .	everybody wants electricity , and i suppose this is the age we live in , " he said . "	but the nuclear plants really messed us up .	we ca n't start thinking about our future until their situation is cleaned up . "	farther down the road , toshiaki kikuchi , 63 , comes back every day to the eight-room inn he ran with his wife , chimiko , because he says it just feels better to be at home ?	despite the broken pipes shooting water onto the street , the blanket of black mud and the 40-foot fishing boat and several cars and trucks that were tossed right up against the inn 's front gate . "	i have nothing to complain about , " kikuchi said . "	i 'm alive .	look at all the destruction around us .	i have it good . "	then he paused . "	i have what i need , " he said . "	but what we do n't have is a future . "
laverl " nick " nicholson used to look out of his kitchen window at the weeping willows that mark the burial place of two of his two daughters .	then a debilitating car wreck left him unable to pay the $ 220,000 he owed on his northwestern montana home .	he tried for a year and a half to lower his mortgage payments through a loan modification , but the government-insured loan that he took out three years ago came with restrictions .	the best the bank could offer him was a reduction of $ 124 per month , leaving nicholson with a $ 1,585 payment that he still could n't afford .	the bank foreclosed last april , forcing him to move next door into a mobile home on two of the original property 's 10 acres that he had given his daughter a few years before .	despite the government 's push to forestall foreclosures through mortgage modifications , situations like nicholson 's have become common .	loan modifications often do n't work out because the homeowner does n't understand what 's out there , the lender is reluctant to write off part of the loan or , as in this case , the terms of a government-back loan limit what the bank can offer a borrower .	today , the house near the small town of thompson falls is being sold in a sealed-bid process by the department of housing and urban development .	the asking price : $ 87,000 .	nicholson , 50 , is galled to see something so dear being advertised so cheaply . "	i 've been a blue-collar worker all my life and i worked hard for what i had .	for it to be thrown back out there for this price and our family not given first option ... , " nicholson paused . "	things are n't supposed to be this way in america .	a man is n't supposed to lose his home for $ 220,000 only to sell it again for $ 87,000 . "	nicholson , like many americans , was drawn to a federal housing administration loan to refinance his home because it offered good terms like a 3.5 percent down payment .	he used the $ 268,000 he borrowed against his home to invest in his business as a sawmill maintenance contractor working in the northwest and across the country .	but with the car accident in 2008 that broke two vertebrae in his neck and a pre-existing degenerative disc disease in his back , he became unable to work .	he began to miss mortgage payments , and the agency that bonded his business discovered his delinquency , causing him to lose his bond and his business .	foreclosure proceedings began and it became necessary for nicholson to seek mortgage relief , but the fha-loan modification terms were limited .	loan servicer wells fargo was only able to offer him a 5.375 percent interest rate , the going market rate , and unlike non-fha loans , his terms could only be extended 30 years instead of 40 years .	the offer would have dropped nicholson 's payments from $ 1,709 to $ 1,585.71 .	he asked for additional relief that would have lowered his payments to under $ 1,000 a month .	he was denied . "	i 'm lost .	i 'm a mechanical-type individual , " nicholson said . "	my knowledge in this field is not good .	so i 'm going on what i 've been told . "	wells fargo spokesman tom goyda said the bank followed fha guidelines in offering nicholson a loan modification . "	we worked for more than a year in an effort to prevent the foreclosure .	under the guidelines available under fha we were unable to find an option that would let him stay in the home at a price he could afford , " goyda said . "	at that point , there were no other options left for modification . "	wells fargo had previously sold nicholson 's mortgage through ginnie mae , the government national mortgage association , to an investor that buys those securities , such as a mutual fund or a pension fund .	when the house went into foreclosure , wells fargo bought back the loan to pay the investor the unpaid balance .	the bank filed a claim with the fha , which provides insurance on loans made by approved lenders .	fha reimbursed wells fargo for the $ 220,000 unpaid principal and approved expenses .	that left the federal government to unload the house for about a third of nicholson 's unpaid principal . "	who 's going to eat the difference between $ 220,000 and $ 87,000 ? "	said julie hope , a counselor for neighborworks montana , a nonprofit housing group helping nicholson . "	the lender 's out of it because they 've turned in their claim on it and gotten their money . "	fha says it 's costing the taxpayers nothing because the money used to pay the claims comes from the mortgage insurance payments by the homeowners who borrow under the program .	fha paid about $ 12.8 billion on nearly 100,000 such claims on foreclosed homes in 2010 , an average of $ 128,000 per claim , said department of housing and urban development spokesman lemar wooley .	the year before , fha paid 70,000 claims at an average cost of about $ 117,000 , for a total of nearly $ 8.2 billion .	the loans have become very popular in the last four years , up from 2 percent of the mortgage industry 's volume in 2006 to about 30 percent today .	fha loans have a lower foreclosure rate than non-fha loans .	at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2010 , the foreclosure rate for all loans was 4.39 percent compared to 3.32 percent for fha loans , wooley said , citing mortgage bankers association delinquency data .	wooley said banks ca n't simply foreclose on a person with an fha loan to save themselves the hassle and possible monetary loss of a loan modification .	fha-approved lenders are required to try to help the borrowers avoid foreclosure or they face penalties , he said . "	lenders that do not engage in loss mitigation and are paid a claim by hud are subject to administrative action , including penalties in the amount of three times the amount of the claim paid to that lender , " wooley said .	but that does n't make it any easier for borrowers like nicholson trying to wade through their options with a foreclosure deadline hanging over them . "	we encourage borrowers in distress to get in touch with a hud-approved counseling agency as soon as possible in the process , " said marietta rodriguez , neighborworks america 's national director for home ownership and lending .	nicholson and neighborworks are investigating whether he has a viable wrongful foreclosure claim , but he said primarily wants to get word out as a warning to others who also may be teetering on the brink of bankruptcy .	he hopes , though , that he might see his daughter and her husband one day move into the home where she grew up . "	i would never move back into the home , but it would be nice to have my children near me .	eventually my health is going to give out and i 'll be in a wheelchair .	it would be nice to have them nearby to help , " he said .
scientists huddled tuesday to analyze data from the ocean floor as they weigh whether a leaking well cap is a sign bp 's broken oil well is buckling .	oil and gas started seeping into the gulf of mexico again sunday night , but this time more slowly , and scientists are n't sure whether the leaks mean the cap that stopped the flow last week is making things worse .	the government 's point man on the disaster , retired coast guard adm. thad allen , will decide again later tuesday whether to continue the test of the experimental cap ?	meaning the oil would stay blocked in .	he said monday the amount of oil leaking was so far inconsequential .	but ever since the flow of oil was closed off thursday , engineers have been glued to underwater cameras and pressure and seismic readings , trying to determine whether the cap is displacing pressure and causing leaks underground , which could make the sea bed unstable and cause the well to collapse . "	as a condition of moving forward with the well-integrity test , bp has to report to us any anomalies and act on those within four hours , " allen said monday .	seepage from the sea floor also was detected over the weekend less than two miles away , but allen said it probably has nothing to do with the well .	oil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the gulf of mexico .	at a monday afternoon briefing in washington , allen said bp could keep the cap closed at least another 24 hours , as long as the company remained alert for leaks .	for those whose livelihood depends on clean waters , worries about the cap were tempered by relief that the oil stopped gushing . "	i 'm for anything that will stop the oil from coming , " said capt. ty fleming , who runs charter fishing trips in orange beach , ala. said tuesday . "	i guess when you 've got how many million gallons pouring out before , and now you have less , it 's like comparing a coconut hitting you in the head with a raisin .	the raisin would be insignificant . "	bp and the government had been at odds over the company 's desire to simply leave the cap in place and employ it like a giant cork in a bottle until a relief well being drilled deep underground can be used to plug up the well permanently .	allen initially said his preference was to pipe oil through the cap to tankers on the surface to reduce the slight chance that the buildup of pressure inside the well would cause a new blowout .	that plan would require releasing millions more gallons of oil into the ocean for a few days during the transition ?	a spectacle bp apparently wants to avoid .	on monday , allen budged a bit , saying unless larger problems develop , he 's not inclined to open the cap .	also on the table : pumping drilling mud through the top of the cap and into the well bore to stop up the oil flow .	the idea is similar to the failed top kill plan that could n't overcome the pressure of the geyser pushing up .	bp said it could work now because there 's less oil to fight against , but it was n't clear how such a method would affect the cap 's stability .	allen said the relief well was still the plan for a permanent fix .	bp and the government are still trying to understand why pressure readings from the well are lower than expected .	allen offered two possible explanations : the reservoir the oil is gushing from is dwindling , or there is an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . "	i 'm not prepared to say the well is shut in until the relief well is done , " which is still several weeks away , allen said . "	there are too many uncertainties . "	bp and the coast guard learned that lesson the hard way after they initially said no oil was coming from the site of the deepwater horizon rig after it exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers .	even after it became clear there was a leak , the company and its federal overseers drastically underestimated its size for weeks .	government investigators are trying to determine whether bp missed a leak of hydraulic fluid in a critical safety device that could have prevented the disaster .	a drilling supervisor testified tuesday that he reported the leak to his supervisor weeks before explosion .	ronald sepulvado , a bp well site leader , told a panel of government investigators in suburban new orleans he did n't know if federal regulators were notified of the leak , as required .	work on a permanent plug is moving steadily , with crews drilling into the side of the ruptured well from deep underground .	by next week , they could start blasting in mud and cement to block off the well for good .	killing the well deep underground works more reliably than bottling it up with a cap .	somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have gushed into the gulf over the past three months in one of america 's worst environmental crises .	bp plc said the cost of dealing with the spill has now reached nearly $ 4 billion .	the company said it has made payments totaling $ 207 million to settle claims for damages .	almost 116,000 claims have been submitted and more than 67,500 payments have been made .	bp stock was down slightly monday . "	i 'm hoping that they 'll get everything cleanup with the next one to two years .	let 's things will get back to normal , " said terry lash , manager of doc 's seafood shack & oyster bar in orange beach , ala.

google is finally ready to split its stock for the first time , more than three years after co-founders larry page and sergey brin began discussing a move engineered to ensure they remain in control of the internet 's most powerful company .	the split is scheduled to occur april 2 .	it had been delayed because of staunch resistance from other google inc. shareholders , who feared the maneuver would unfairly benefit page and brin at the expense of just about everyone else .	google proposed the unorthodox split so that page and brin could preserve power in the company they started in a rented garage more than 15 years ago .	it addresses concerns that the founders would lose control of google as the company creates more shares to compensate its employees and buy startups .	to gain clearance for the split , google settled a shareholders lawsuit and agreed to pay up to $ 7.5 billion if the split does n't pan out the way the mountain view , california , company envisions .	google 's split will create a new class of " c '' stock that carries no voting power .	one share of c stock will be distributed for each share of voting class a stock owned as of march 27 .	initially , the value of the current stock will be divided equally between the two types of shares .	but they will then trade separately with different ticker symbols .	if the split had n't been delayed by a legal skirmish , google 's stock probably would n't have exceeded $ 1,000 for the first time last fall .	page and brin primarily own google 's class b stock , which already gives them 10 times the voting power of each class a share .	combined , the google founders control 56 percent of the shareholder votes , even though they own less than 15 percent of the stock issued .	nonetheless , the voting clout of page and brin has been gradually shrinking , as google has used class a stock to reward employees and finance some of its acquisitions during the past decade .	distributing a new class of non-voting stock will enable google to continue doling out shares to its nearly 44,000 workers without further undermining the co-founders ' power .	as with any stock split , the division will lower google 's trading price on the nasdaq stock market as investors account for a big increase in shares .	the company will be distributing about 277 million shares of class c stock , based on how many class a shares had been issued as of late last year .	if google 's shares behave similarly to other 2-for-1 splits , the stock 's price would be cut roughly in half from its current level of more than $ 1,100 .	google 's market value would remain roughly the same at about $ 380 billion because it will have nearly double the number of shares issued .	but some shareholders suspect the non-voting status of the class c stock will cause those shares to trade at a significant discount to the class a stock once the new stock is issued .	the concerns led to a class-action lawsuit in delaware chancery court filed shortly after google announced its plans for the split in april 2012 .	google delayed the stock split until the lawsuit was resolved .	a trial was averted after google hammered out a settlement .	court approval came three months ago .	google will have to pay the class c shareholders if the average price of their stock is at least 1 percent below the class a shares during the first year after the split .	the size of the payments will escalate as the gap widens , with the maximum payout required if the gap between the average prices of the class c and class a shares is 5 percent or more .	in the most expensive scenario for google , class c stockholders will get 5 percent of the average trading price of the class a shares .	so if the class a stock has an average trading price of $ 600 during the first year after the split while the class c stock averages $ 565 , google would have to pay $ 30 per share in cash or additional stock .	in court documents , google argued that it 's unlikely there will be a big difference between the prices of the class a and class c shares , despite their contrasting voting powers .
negotiations have broken down on a bill that would allow kentucky to quickly license hemp growers if the federal government ever lifts a ban on the crop , a legislative leader said monday .	house floor leader rocky adkins , d-catlettsburg , had voiced optimism early monday that a deal could be struck between house and senate negotiators before the legislature adjourns on tuesday .	however , by monday night , he said he was disappointed by the lack of progress .	the hemp legislation has been hotly debated this year in frankfort and was languishing in the house before adkins stepped in with a proposal that seemed to revive it .	hemp thrived as a crop in kentucky generations ago but has been banned for decades by the federal government after it was classified as a controlled substance .	under adkins ' proposal , the kentucky state police would be the agency designated to issue licenses to hemp growers .	that 's an effort to appease lawmakers who worry that hemp could be used as a cover crop to camouflage illegal marijuana . "	the intent is to make it a better bill and a stronger bill , " adkins said .	the proposal also would involve the university of kentucky in hemp research and would revamp the kentucky hemp commission to include the kentucky state police commissioner and the uk agriculture dean as co-chairs along with the state agriculture commissioner .	the original hemp proposal has already cleared the senate and made it through a house committee .	agriculture commissioner james comer has said the crop could be an economic boon for kentucky .	besides creating another crop for the state 's farmers , comer said hemp could lead to manufacturing jobs that produce products ranging from paper to cosmetics .	but the bill has been unpopular with law enforcement officials who complain that industrial hemp and marijuana have identical leaves and that laboratory tests is required to distinguish between the two .	hemp has less thc , the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a high .	under adkins ' proposed amendment , the state 's hemp commission would be attached to the university of kentucky for administrative purposes and would establish a 5-year research program and would seek a federal waiver to allow the state to grow hemp on demonstration sites .

"	a lot of adults are pretty overwhelmed and scared by this , and they have to be aware of their own feelings , " he said .

a member of louisiana 's top higher education board left the job friday , saying repeated budget cuts to colleges have left him too frustrated and cynical to continue in the position .	vic stelly , a former lawmaker from lake charles , sent an email to members of the board of regents announcing his decision a day earlier .	he exited the board , which oversees public higher education spending and management , six months before his term was set to end in december . "	i ca n't see how being frustrated and negative for six more months is to anyone 's benefit , " stelly wrote to his colleagues and regents staff .	the jindal administration and lawmakers have stripped $ 427 million in state funding from higher education since 2008 , as state tax revenue has fallen below expectations and budget shortfalls have repeatedly appeared .	that includes $ 66 million in cuts for the fiscal year that begins july 1 .	tuition increases on students have offset some , but not all , of the gap .	stelly was vocal on the regents board about his unhappiness with the cuts and the rising costs for students . "	he expressed his frustration often on how important higher education is to the growth of a state and to economic development in a state and felt cutting higher education was somewhat akin to shooting yourself in the foot , " said larry tremblay , a deputy commissioner with the regents office , who said he was surprised by stelly 's resignation .	when the most recent budget plan was passed by lawmakers this month , higher education leaders praised the outcome for sparing schools even deeper cuts that had been considered by legislators .	but stelly disagreed with the reaction . "	having seen five years of state higher ed funding cuts totaling almost a half a million dollars ( and no end in sight ) i 'm tired of saying , ' it could have been worse . '	i , therefore , have submitted my resignation from the board of regents , " stelly wrote .	the former lawmaker also submitted a one-sentence resignation letter to gov. bobby jindal , who will choose his successor to the regents board .	stelly , a registered independent , served four terms in the state house from 1988 to 2004 , with time spent on the budget and education committees .	he was appointed to the regents board in 2007 by then-gov .	kathleen blanco .

officials say that metro atlanta could fall out of compliance with air quality rules under tougher guidelines being considered by the u.s. environmental protection agency .	the atlanta journal-constitution reports that commuters could play an increasingly critical role in improving air quality as new rules are considered .	brian carr of georgia 's clean air campaign says motorists could play a key role because half of all smog-forming emissions come from car tailpipes , and atlanta 's average commute is 35 miles round trip .	smog ?	or ground-level ozone ?	is formed when air pollutants react in sunlight .	atlanta 's ozone level has dropped from more than 120 parts per billion in the 1980s to 80 parts per billion today .	the lowest level now under consideration by the epa would put the new limit at 60 parts per billion .

the horseracing integrity and safety act is sponsored by u.s. sen. tom udall , a democrat from new mexico , and republican house members ed whitfield of kentucky and joe pitts of pennsylvania .	the bill would give the united states anti-doping agency authority to enforce standards in races with simulcast wagering .	usada , the official anti-doping agency for the u.s. olympics , would welcome the chance to branch out . "	at the end of the day , what 's important is having an effective regulation system that has uniform standards , " travis tygart , the head of usada , said in a phone interview wednesday night . "	it gives the public confidence in what ultimately they 're watching or , in the case of horse racing in the united states , the betting industry , which is such a big part of it . "	everyone deserves , particularly in that environment , to have a level playing field .	because if an animal is covertly and secretly gaining a performance advantage by these drugs and is able to defeat a nonexistent or an inconsistent policy that may currently be in place among the states , that detracts away and completely undermines the market from a betting standpoint .	that 's something congress or the public should n't tolerate . "	in a statement released wednesday , udall said racing groups have pledged drug reforms before " but this bill would bring in real standards and enforcement from an organization with a proven record for cleaning up sports . "	udall , whitfield and pitts were involved in congressional hearings last year that delved into medication and performance enhancing drugs in the sport .	under the legislation , usada would draft rules to put an end to race day medication , set a uniform medication policy framework , impose stiff penalties for cheating and ensure that racehorse drug administration complies with veterinary ethics .	tygart believes this model would be effective in policing horse racing . "	hopefully , we 'll rally around that idea just as the olympics sports did 15 years ago in setting up wada and the usadas of the world , " tygart said . "	we 'll finally put a stake in the ground and make a mark that they 're going to do everything they can to protect the rights of athletes , the public and the integrity of horse racing .	we 're happy to play whatever role we can toward that end . "	alex waldrop , the president and ceo of the national thoroughbred racing association , said the proposal was promising but the organization will " withhold comment on any proposed federal legislation until we have had a chance to thoroughly review the actual bill . "	however , we are encouraged by the significant progress the industry has made on the safety and integrity front over the past several years , " waldrop said . "	relying on a broad range of industry input and scientific research , state regulators are setting the stage for nationwide , uniform implementation of strengthened drug and medication rules , testing and penalties by as early as january 1 , 2014 .	the ntra strongly supports these carefully considered state regulatory reforms and encourages regulators to expedite their adoption and nationwide implementation . "	on saturday , the kentucky derby will be run at churchill downs .	for those involved , it 's the ideal backdrop to bring the issues to the forefront . "	for too long , the safety of jockeys and equine athletes has been neglected for the pursuit of racing profits , " whitfield said . "	the doping of injured horses and forcing them to compete is deplorable and must be stopped . "	despite repeated promises from the racing industry to end this practice , meaningful action and oversight has yet to come forth .	this legislation would bring much-needed reforms to an industry that supports thousands of jobs and is enjoyed by spectators nationwide .

the longtime executive director of the tennessee state museum is rejecting calls for her to be replaced as the state plans for a new $ 160 million facility in nashville .	lois riggins-ezell in an interview with the knoxville news sentinel ( http://bit.ly/1e33jut ) said she plans to remain " as long as i can , " citing her role in growing the museum from six staffers working in a basement of the war memorial building in 1981 to its current 120,000-square foot facilities with 42 employees and an annual budget of $ 3.8 million , not counting private donations . "	i am the museum , " riggins-ezell exclaimed while discussing criticism of her accomplishments , though she promptly expressed regret at the remark .	former ambassador victor ashe , a member and former chairman of the board overseeing museum operations , said riggins-ezzell should be " honored and saluted " for her past work , but should step aside for new leadership in a new era with a new museum in the works .	ashe said riggins-ezell has shown a bias toward nashville-area art purchases over works produced in other parts of the state .	there is a public perception that " it 's not a state museum , it 's a nashville museum , " he said .	riggins-ezell adamantly disputes that statement , reeling off a long list of examples of artifacts and exhibits about the eastern and western sections of the state , and noting that contemporary art makes up a small portion of the museum 's collections .	a special audit released by the state comptroller earlier this year found that a museum employee had stolen more than $ 61,000 , mostly by falsifying invoices .	the worker charged with theft , forgery and fraud was fired shortly after the comptroller 's report was released .	another museum worker resigned after being arrested last month by officers who reported seizing 300 pounds of marijuana .	both former employees had had prior criminal records , which ashe said " at the very best show poor judgment " by riggins-ezzell , who is responsible for all hiring and firing at the museum .	riggins-ezzell said both workers had originally been hired as contractors on a temporary basis , and that both did good work and wound up getting jobs as state employees .	ashe said he plans to bring up the idea of establishing a search committee to find a successor to riggins-ezzell at the museum commission 's next meeting in october .	while he acknowledged that a motion to oust her may not find support at this point , he said " we ought to at least talk about it . " "	on boards , i 've always raised questions that others did n't want to answer , " said ashe , who served in the state house and senate in the 1980s and later as mayor of knoxville . "	i did the same thing as a legislator .	( but ) i try to be professional and impersonal . "	riggins-ezzell said ashe 's tendency toward hyperbole and exaggeration can be irritating , but added that there are also positive aspects .	ashe has been " very challenging to me , " she said , but has " asked good questions " as a commission member . "	it has helped me look very closely at my own actions and clarify " what needs to be done , she said .
washington lawmakers have adjourned their 105-day legislative session , but only get a two-week reprieve before they return to olympia for a special session to finish their work on the state budget .	budget writers in the house and senate will continue their negotiations in the coming days in hopes in hopes of being closer to a deal by the time the rest of the legislature returns on may 13 .	gov. jay inslee has insisted that while the budget will be the " central responsibility " of lawmakers during the special session , he also made clear he wants them to take up policy bills that stalled during the regular session , including ones dealing with abortion insurance coverage , gun violence and allowing young immigrants living in the country without legal permission to be eligible for college financial aid .	here 's a look at the things to watch for during the upcoming special session , as well as some history on those not-so-unusual overtime sessions : ?	budget : lawmakers need to address a projected budget deficit of more than $ 1.2 billion for the next two-year budget ending in mid-2015 , not counting additional money needed for a court-ordered requirement that they increase funding to basic education .	the house and senate have taken different approaches to balance state spending and increase funding for education , with the biggest difference centered around whether to raise revenue from extending taxes or eliminating tax breaks .	the senate is controlled by a coalition of 23 republicans and two democrats , and they passed a budget during the regular session that balances spending without new taxes , relying on cuts to social programs and fund transfers .	the house 's budget would increase tax revenue by roughly $ 1 billion over the next two years , including a permanent extension of business taxes to raise more than half a billion dollars .	the plan would also repeal tax breaks for travel agents , bottled water and fuel .	both sides have been meeting for the past week to try and work toward agreement . ?	education funding : the washington supreme court decided in january 2012 that the legislature was not meeting its constitutional duty to fully pay for basic education with state dollars .	the court gave lawmakers until 2018 to pay for the school reform ideas they had already approved , to fund the legislature 's definition of basic education , find a sustainable source of money for schools , and to take back the financial burden from school districts , which use local levies to fill the gaps .	in response to the ruling , many lawmakers and gov. jay inslee are looking to add at least $ 1 billion to education this year .	the senate and house budgets add money to the k-12 budget to answer the ruling , but their approaches differ .	while both add money to full-day kindergarten , classroom supplies and transportation , the house also puts more money into upper grade instructional hours and class size reduction . ?	policy bills : inslee cited several policy bills he 'd like to see addressed during the special session , including a measure to strengthen the state 's impaired driving laws in the wake of recent fatal accidents , an issue that has bipartisan support and which inslee said they are close to a deal on ; a transportation tax package to pay for road maintenance and projects , including a replacement for the i-5 bridge over the columbia river ; a plan aimed to make washington the first state to require insurers that cover maternity care to also pay for abortions ; and the financial aid bill known as the " dream act " for young immigrants in the country illegally .	gun control advocates have launched an initiative campaign after an effort to expand background checks on gun sales stalled , but inslee indicated that the legislature could still take action on the issue , saying " if common sense is allowed votes , we can move forward . "	inslee noted that there are policy bills that republicans are likely interested to discuss during special session as well .	republican policy bills that stalled in the legislature include measures dealing with the state 's worker compensation system , payday lending , and some education-related bills , like one that would grade schools . ?	interim : over the next few weeks , inslee will continue signing some of the more than 300 bills passed by the legislature during the regular session .	also , inslee says that budget negotiators will be meeting regularly . "	we will be engaged in some vigorous work in hopes that the legislature can produce a budget and finish their remaining work in a quick and orderly fashion , " he said sunday night . ?	special session history : not counting the upcoming overtime session , there have been 40 special sessions since 1981 , including second and third special sessions held within the same year , said patrick mcdonald , assistant to secretary of state kim wyman .	since washington state switched from a biannual session to a yearly session in 1981 , the state has held 105-day sessions in odd years , and 60-day sessions on even years .	before that switch , special sessions started becoming the norm in the 1950s , according to a list put together by the state .	the first special session was held in 1890 and lasted nine days .	last year , lawmakers used the full 30 days of one special session , then headed into a several-hour second special session before adjourning .

nora ephron is thinking about algorithms .	she wonders what they are .	it 's one of those concepts , such as twitter and heavy metal , that exist only to remind her she has lived too long .	unsure of her own definition , she takes a little nip from that electronic flask in her handbag , that digital demon rum : her iphone . "	algorithm , " she reads , " a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps , as for finding the greatest common divisor . "	exactly . "	thank god for my portable device . "	she is seated at an upper east side diner , around 10:30 a.m. , warmed up in a dark blouse and matching slacks , enjoying scrambled eggs and crisp bacon , undisturbed by the occasional glances from two middle-age men , in business attire , in the next booth .	ephron is 69 , known for such books as " heartburn " and " crazy salad , " and for the movies " sleepless in seattle " and " julie & julia .

"	the subjects included aging , illness and death , a corrective she says , to all those books that tell you how wonderful it is to grow old .	she is back with " i remember nothing , " essays about family , journalism and everyday and eternal bothers .	there are lists of what she will miss ( bacon , paris ) and what she will not ( funerals , mammograms ) .	much of the book is a farewell to her own memory .	she is not writing about alzheimer 's , but the way people and places and events fade as if erased from tape .	this is a new kind of name-dropping .	she can brag about having met the beatles , but not about what they said .	she does not know .	same for cary grant , dorothy parker and eleanor roosevelt .	she marched on washington in 1967 to protest the vietnam war and remembers only the sex she had in her hotel room .	as a reporter for the new york post , she interviewed the much-censored lenny bruce several times . "	lenny bruce kept being thrown out of new york and every time he was , i was sent to meet him at the airport , " ephron says . "	what did he say ?	you do n't know and neither do i. " her amnesia appears contagious .	one old friend , author-humorist calvin trillin , spoke of ephron as a great wit and a colorful " auntie mame " figure to his daughters .	but he was stumped when asked for a favorite memory . "	my mind goes blank , " he says . "	i ca n't think of the time that nora did such and such .	i suppose one will come to me as i fall asleep tonight . " "	i do n't exactly remember when i met her , " adds author-journalist pete hamill , whose friendship with ephron dates to when both worked at the post . "	nora would probably know better than i. " that is unlikely . "	it 's not that i do n't need to remember things , i just do n't remember them , " she says . "	i do little things with the mnemonics and then i ca n't remember the mnemonics .	the other day i could n't remember the name of the extremely nice person who blows out my hair when i 'm in la. .	all i could remember is she had the same name as the mysterious guy with the big hair a few years ago .	and i could n't remember his name , either .	i thought , eventually , it will get back into my head . "	and this morning , as if by a miracle , the name fabio came into my head and i remembered it . "	when the brain fails , technology fills in .	it 's her friend , her foe , her shadow .	her iphone means she will never truly forget the name of a favorite character actor .	but she worries that the screen is harmful to writing .	in the old days , the blocked author had nothing but walls to stare at .	now , there is facebook .	and lying about your past is a lost and impossible art . "	my grandmother did n't know when she was born .	she had no idea , because she was born in russia .	the calendar was different .	it was 18-something or other when she came to america , " ephron says . "	i think you certainly can make the case that the ability to reinvent yourself is a lovely thing that 's probably been stolen from us completely by all this record keeping . "	born in new york in 1941 , ephron , the daughter of screenwriters henry and phoebe ephron , spent much of her childhood in beverly hills , california .	as she writes in her new book , regular visitors included " casablanca " co-writer julius j. epstein , " sunset boulevard " collaborator charles brackett , and the team of albert hackett and frances goodrich , who worked on " the thin man " and " it 's a wonderful life . "	everyone was in movies , " the business . " "	people who were not in the business were known as civilians , " ephron writes .	she graduated from wellesley college in 1962 , moved to new york and started out as a " mail girl " and fact checker at newsweek .	a newspaper strike at the end of the year proved her breakthrough .	victor navasky , the future editor of the nation , was then running a satirical magazine called the monacle .	he was working on a parody of the new york post , " the new york pest , " and asked ephron for a spoof of post columnist leonard lyons .	she succeeded so well that the newspaper 's publisher , dorothy schiff , reasoned that anyone who could make fun of the post could also write for it .	ephron was asked to try out as a reporter .	within a week , she had a permanent job . "	she had this one thing : talent , " hamill says . "	she had the gift that later blossomed , the wonderful , ironic laughter and humor and the precision of the writing . "	by the 1970s , she was reporting for esquire and new york magazine and had met and mated with carl bernstein , the washington post reporter who teamed with bob woodward on coverage of the watergate scandal .	they married in 1976 , and had two children .	ephron was pregnant with the second when she learned bernstein was having an affair , a betrayal that had its rewards , once she stopped crying .	she wrote a novel , " heartburn , " later a film starring jack nicholson and meryl streep .	the book was so close to her life that bernstein threatened to sue .	the memory of the book 's birth is easily summoned . "	yes , totally , completely , absolutely , sitting at the legendary and long-gone smith corona electric typewriter that i once had , " she says . "	i was working on a screenplay and wrote the first 10 pages of a novel , and i knew the title , knew there were going to be recipes in it .	this i remember , exactly where i was , working and knowing , ' oh , i see , enough time has passed that i 'm ready to do this . ' "	she does not know whether she will write another novel and does not worry .	she just likes the writing process , whether essays or screenplays or the occasional entry on the huffington post .	her iphone has not kept her from writing every day and from working on a film about singer peggy lee , with reese witherspoon expected in the starring role .	in " the o word , " an essay from her new book , she anticipates growing too old to make jokes about her age .	she will be " really old , " beyond sex in a hotel room , or even a frozen custard at shake shack .	it would be nice if she believed in a higher being , she agrees , but the phrase " everything happens for a reason " is a sermon that only annoys her .	she thinks of each day as perhaps the last that she will be able to live as she pleases .	ephron writes of summers in the hamptons on long island when her children were little , of fireworks on the fourth of july and picnics on the beach .	she loved the sound of geese in mid-july ? "	one of the things that made the summers out there so magical . "	now , the geese remind her that summer will end , and so will everything else . "	i especially began to hate their sound , which was not beating wings ?	how could i have ever thought it was ? ?	but a lot of uneuphonious honks , " she writes .

americans living in predominantly wealthy , white neighborhoods account for nearly all the sizable campaign contributions in this year 's presidential election , according to an associated press analysis , even as the presidential candidates have aggressively courted hispanics .	latino voters are widely viewed as pivotal for victories in some battleground states tuesday .	the disparity in donating particularly affects latinos .	about 16 percent of the u.s. population is hispanic , but not even 4 percent of the more than $ 1.3 billion in 3 million-plus itemized contributions came from mostly hispanic neighborhoods this year , the ap 's analysis showed .	more than 90 percent came from majority white neighborhoods .	hispanics , by at least this important measure of contributing to a candidate whose views they support , are remarkably disengaged in the election yet represent a significant ethnic group for president barack obama and republican mitt romney . "	the hardest part is the economic sacrifice , " said roland garcia , director of the texas future fund , who helped raise money for obama . "	latino families are busy trying to make ends meet . "	even among the poorest neighborhoods , non-hispanics contributed far more regularly to the campaigns and the political groups that supported them .	the trend similarly holds true for campaign contributions from mostly black , asian or native american neighborhoods .	hispanics , the largest minority bloc , are emerging as a constituency that could determine the presidency , especially in colorado , florida , nevada , north carolina and virginia .	obama and romney have heavily courted the latino vote and devoted time to discuss immigration policy at the town-hall presidential debate in october .	a hotel manager in laredo , texas , raul perales , said he gave $ 5,000 to romney after a lunch with the former massachusetts governor in san antonio .	other donors he knows wo n't stretch their finances for any politician . "	it does n't suit anyone to give more than they can afford , " he said . "	that would be nonsense . "	the ap analysis did not consider the sources of contributions of $ 200 or less per person because , under federal law , political groups are not required to disclose any identifying information about such donors , even their names .	about 65 percent of donors supporting obama gave more than $ 200 , compared with 85 percent for romney .	these donors , including " bundlers " who raise hundreds of thousands of dollars , are most likely to receive invitations to lavish donor parties , state dinners at the white house or policy briefings with senior advisers .	differences in income may contribute to the disparity .	median household income for hispanics was $ 37,759 , but for non-hispanic whites it was $ 54,620 , according to 2010 census figures .	minorities also have unemployment rates above the national average of 8 percent .	some latino immigrants regularly send money home to their families .	both parties have made significant efforts to reach out to minority groups .	but the ap 's analysis confirmed a pattern , first reported in 2004 by researchers at public campaign , a washington-based , nonprofit group that supports election changes : a tiny fraction of contributions worth $ 200 or more coming from nonwhite communities . "	the most important voice is the vote , and financial contributions come in second , " said arturo vargas , director of the national association of latino elected and appointed officials . "	not being a major source of financial contributions and not having a tradition of contributing to candidates complicates our development as a political community .	even if the candidates deny it , the reality is that donors are those who enjoy the best access to candidates . "	the ap analyzed contributions to candidates ' official campaigns , their political parties and " super " political committees that support them .	federal data do not include demographic information about donors , so the ap mapped donor addresses with demographic data for each census block .	that 's the smallest geographic area that the federal government measures , roughly the size of a neighborhood .	that helped identify what donors were most likely to be hispanic .	donations from majority hispanic neighborhoods account for only 3.5 percent of itemized donations through mid-october .	that correlates with about 2.7 percent from majority black neighborhoods and less than 1 percent from asian communities .	the gap is even greater among neighborhoods with fewer whites .	about 2 percent , or $ 26 million , of the contributions came from neighborhoods in which 75 percent of residents identified themselves in the 2010 census as hispanic .

voters embraced the tea party 's conservative throw-the-bums-out anthem in key races across the country , with the movement 's favored candidates taking more than a dozen house seats held by democrats , three senate races and the south carolina governorship .	the movement did not make a complete sweep despite a strong anti-democratic climate , with the most prominent losses coming from tea party stars christine o'donnell of delaware and sharron angle of nevada .	angle could n't overcome senate majority leader harry reid , and o'donnell was soundly defeated after old videos emerged of her discussing witchcraft , masturbation and mice with human brains .	but tea party heroes rand paul of kentucky and marco rubio of florida were elected to the senate , while sarah palin-backed republican nikki haley was elected south carolina governor .	all were long shots when they declared their candidacies but won over voters with their washington outsider , anti-tax campaigns . "	we 've come to take our government back , " said paul , a first-time candidate and son of libertarian hero rep. ron paul of texas .	he promised to lead a movement for fiscal sanity , limited constitutional government and balanced budgets and to begin working to build a tea party caucus in the senate first thing wednesday morning . "	there 's a tea party tidal wave , and we 're sending a message , " paul said .	tea party patriots co-founder jennybeth martin said local activists from across the country would host a meeting for freshmen lawmakers nov. 14 to remind them that the movement 's continuing support depends on their performance . "	we 've watched what 's happened in the past ?	republican or democrats promise things when they are running , and then they get to washington and they do what their party leadership wants them to , " she said from a victory party at a washington hotel . "	we 're not going to let that happen this time .	if they uphold our core values and the constitution , then they will have political backing from us .	if not , we 'll do this again in two years . "	tea party candidates were running strong as returns came in wednesday morning , picking up several democratic seats in the republican takeover of the house .	chief among them was republican vicky hartzler , who courted tea party support in her victory over house armed service committee chairman ike skelton .	she ended skelton 's 34 years in congress .	republicans with tea party support also defeated democratic incumbents in arizona , florida , north carolina , new jersey , michigan , indiana , wisconsin , south dakota and two seats each in new york and illinois .	and they picked up seats held by retiring democrats in louisiana , washington , wisconsin , michigan and two in arkansas .	the question for election day was whether the tea party candidates would end up hurting the republican party more than they helped by putting up some less viable candidates .	that appeared to be the case in the nevada senate race and in delaware , where tea party-fueled candidacies for o'donnell and glen urquhart for the state 's republican-held house seat gave democrats easy victories that would n't have been expected early in the campaign .	democrats were able to hold onto the colorado governorship after tea party-backed gop nominee dan maes ' campaign imploded and third-party candidate tom tancredo entered the race and splintered the support of the state 's activists .	but fears that other third-party tea party candidates would siphon voters from republican nominees were unfounded elsewhere .	rubio , paul and tea party republican mike lee of utah were elected to seats held by republicans , so they did not contribute to gop hopes for gains in the senate .	and republican leaders may get a challenge from tea party lawmakers who vowed to put their conservative principles before party . "	our nation is headed in the wrong direction and both parties are to blame , " said rubio , a former state house speaker and son of cuban exiles .	he said his election was part of " a second chance for republicans to be what they said they were going to be not so long ago . "	rep. john boehner , who planned to take over as speaker after republicans won the house , assured tea party activists from his ohio district in a skype call after poll closing that he would never let them down , boehner spokesman kevin smith said .	candidates with tea party support were on the ballot in more than 70 house districts , seven races for senate and three for governor .	some were incumbents , such as south carolina republican rep. joe wilson .	wilson became an early hero to tea partiers for yelling " you lie ! "	to president barack obama during a joint session of congress , and held onto his seat in a race that was infused with out-of-state donations for both sides after the heckle .	four in 10 voters considered themselves tea party supporters , according to preliminary exit poll results .	and nearly 9 in 10 of those tea party supporters voted for the republican house candidate .	but the tea party also was a polarizing force among some voters ?	about a quarter of voters said they considered their vote a message of support for the tea party and nearly as many said their vote was meant to signal opposition to the movement .	about half said the tea party was n't a factor .	the movement 's candidates had no unified agenda , but often pushed for a balanced budget , elimination of the federal debt , repeal of the health care law and strict interpretation of the constitution .	the ap 's polling analysis found nearly 9 in 10 tea party supporters wanted to repeal health care and felt obama 's policies hurt the country .	only about a quarter of non-tea party supporters felt that way .	tea party candidates were n't always easy to identify since the movement is a network of loosely connected community groups ?	not an established political party with official nominees .	even within the tea party there often was disagreement among rival groups about the legitimacy of candidates claiming tea party credentials .	in identifying candidates , the associated press assessed factors including a candidate 's history with the movement , the involvement of local leaders and activists in a campaign , endorsements or support from tea party-affiliated groups and whether a candidate is running on a platform that dovetails with the movement 's agenda .

the long-delayed keystone xl oil pipeline cleared a major hurdle toward approval friday , a serious blow to environmentalists ' hopes that president barack obama will block the controversial project running more than 1,100 miles ( 1,900 kilometers ) from canada through the heart of the u.s. .	the state department reported no major environmental objections to the proposed $ 7 billion pipeline , which has become a symbol of the political debate over climate change .	republicans and some oil - and gas-producing states in the u.s. ?	as well as canada 's minister of natural resources ?	cheered the report , but it further rankled environmentalists already at odds with obama and his energy policy .	the report stops short of recommending approval of the pipeline , but the review gives obama new support if he chooses to endorse it in spite of opposition from many democrats and environmental groups .	foes say the pipeline would carry " dirty oil " that contributes to global warming , and they also express concern about possible spills .	republicans and business and labor groups have urged obama to approve the pipeline to create thousands of jobs and move further toward north american energy independence .	the pipeline is also strongly supported by democrats in oil and gas-producing states , including sens. mary landrieu of louisiana , mark begich of alaska and mark pryor of arkansas .	all face re-election this year and could be politically damaged by rejection of the pipeline .	republican mitt romney carried all three states in the 2012 presidential election .	the 1,179-mile ( 1,900-kilometer ) pipeline would travel through the heart of the united states , carrying oil derived from tar sands in western canada to a hub in nebraska , where it would connect with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day to refineries on the texas gulf coast .	it would cross montana and south dakota before reaching nebraska .	an existing spur runs through kansas and oklahoma to texas .	canadian tar sands are likely to be developed regardless of u.s. action on the pipeline , the report said , the report says oil derived from tar sands in alberta generates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming than traditional crude .	but the report makes clear that other methods of transporting the oil ?	including rail , trucks and barges ?	would release more greenhouse gases than the pipeline .	u.s. and canadian accident investigators warned last week about the dangers of oil trains that transport crude oil from north dakota and other states to refineries in the u.s. and canada .	the officials urged new safety rules , cautioning that a major loss of life could result from an accident involving the increasing use of trains to transport large amounts of crude oil .	an alternative that relies on shipping the oil by rail through the central u.s. to gulf coast refineries would generate 28 percent more greenhouse gases than a pipeline , the report said .	state department approval is needed because the pipeline crosses a u.s. border .	other agencies will have 90 days to comment before secretary of state john kerry makes a recommendation to obama on whether the project is in the national interest .	a final decision is not expected before summer .	senate minority leader mitch mcconnell , a republican , said the report " once again confirms that there is no reason for the white house to continue stalling construction of the keystone xl pipeline . "	mcconnell said : " mr. president , no more stalling , no more excuses .	please pick up that pen you 've been talking so much about and make this happen .	americans need these jobs . "	however , a top official at the natural resources defense council , an environmental group , said the report gives obama all the information he needs to reject the pipeline . "	piping the dirtiest oil on the planet through the heart of america would endanger our farms , our communities , our fresh water and our climate , " said susan casey-lefkowitz , the nrdc 's international program director . "	that is absolutely not in our national interest . "	the report said the pipeline was likely to have an adverse effect on the endangered american burying beetle , found in south dakota and nebraska .	but it said that could be offset by a monitoring program and other requirements on the pipeline operator .	in canada , natural resources minister joe oliver welcomed the report and said officials there " await a timely decision " on the pipeline . "	the choice for the united states is clear : oil supply from a reliable , environmentally responsible friend and neighbor or from unstable sources with similar or higher greenhouse gas emissions and lesser environmental standards , " he said .	the new report comes only days after obama 's state of the union address , in which he reiterated his support for an " all-of-the-above " energy strategy that embraces a wide range of sources , from oil and natural gas to renewables such as wind and solar power .	the remarks were a rebuff to some of his environmental allies who argued that obama 's support of expanded oil and gas production does n't make sense for a president who wants to reduce pollution linked to global warming .	obama blocked the keystone xl pipeline in january 2012 , saying he did not have enough time for a fair review before a deadline forced on him by congressional republicans .	that delayed the choice for him until after his re-election .	obama 's initial rejection went over badly in canada , which relies on the u.s. for 97 percent of its energy exports .	the pipeline is critical to canada , which needs infrastructure in place to export its growing oil sands production in response , obama quickly suggested development of an oklahoma-to-texas line to alleviate an oil bottleneck at a cushing , oklahoma , storage hub .	oil began moving on that segment of the pipeline last week .	the 485-mile ( 780-kilometer ) southern section of the pipeline operated by calgary-based transcanada did not require presidential approval because it does not cross a u.s. border .	transcanada chief executive russ girling said he was pleased at the latest environmental review , the fifth released on the project since 2010 . "	the conclusions have n't varied .	they are the same as before , " he said .	environmental groups criticized the state department for publishing the report before the department 's inspector general released findings of an inquiry into a contractor that worked on the review .	friends of the earth and other groups say the contractor , environmental resources management , has financial ties to transcanada . "	we feel confident there are no issues related to this contractor , " said kerri ann jones , an assistant secretary of state who has overseen the keystone review .

cheyenne and arapaho tribes officials are disappointed with a federal judge 's decision to keep the tribe 's accounts at an oklahoma bank frozen until an internal leadership dispute is resolved , a spokeswoman said .	the tribe had asked u.s. district judge david russell to lift the freeze on about $ 6.4 million by clinton-based first bank and trust co. , but russell allowed the freeze to remain in place .	he cited the ongoing dispute between the tribe 's governor , janice prairie chief-boswell , and its one-time lieutenant governor , leslie wandrie-harjo , over who is the tribe 's leader .	a hearing on the leadership and banking issues is set for june 8 in custer county district court , where the bank filed for the administrative freeze .	tribe spokeswoman lisa liebl told the oklahoman ( http://bit.ly/jjgvun ) that the workweek for about 500 tribal employees has been reduced to 32 hours because of the frozen funds , and checks written by the tribe to workers , contractors and vendors have been returned because of insufficient funds . "	now , we 'll just wait for our court date on june 8 .	... that 's all we can do at this point , " she said . "	we 're still locked out of those accounts , those frozen funds , so we have no idea what 's happening with all of that . "	the judge 's order , issued wednesday , noted that depending on which side wins the governance dispute , " the bank faces potential liability for the payment of money at the request of an unauthorized signatory .	... in light of the ongoing governance issues , about which plaintiffs have presented no evidence , the court can not conclude that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in their quest to have the administrative freeze lifted . "	scott meacham , who represents the bank , has said bank officials initially asked the courts to freeze the accounts because of uncertainty about the authorized signatory .	meacham was out of the office friday and did n't immediately return a request for comment .

it 's a new year and new jersey republicans are seeing green .	the state republican party said it had raised nearly $ 1 million during the first quarter of the year ?	nearly eight times what the party has raised on average during the same period in the last decade .	gop party chair samuel raia said the party raised $ 941,000 in the first quarter of 2011 .	by comparison , during the first quarter of 2007 ?	the last time the entire legislature was up for election , as it is this year ?	republicans raised $ 24,600 to democrats ' $ 214,300 .	democrats dominated the fundraising game for years , but that began to change with the election of republican gov. chris christie in 2009 .

" "	we have high expectations for this new agency to be a solid foundation for advancing the human rights of women , " said charlotte bunch of the center for women 's global leadership at rutgers university in new jersey .	the center is a member of the gear campaign comprising over 300 groups that have been working to win approval for a more effective u.n. organization for women .	the general assembly unanimously approved a resolution last september supporting the merger .	the resolution ?	virtually certain to be approved ?	authorizes the merger and orders it to be operational by jan. 1 , 2011 .	the european union has been a driving force in the four-year campaign to streamline the u.n.

republican state sen. jane orie began her career as a prosecutor and knows too much about evidence and the criminal justice system to commit the obvious document forgeries attributed to her , orie 's lawyer told a jury wednesday .	orie , 50 , of mccandless , is being retried on 10 campaign corruption charges .	her first trial ended in a mistrial last year because of a forged defense exhibit .	her new trial now also includes 16 new counts , including perjury , forgery and evidence tampering related to orie 's testimony and documents introduced at the first trial .	one document was so obviously doctored allegheny county judge jeffrey manning said " even ray charles could see " it in granting the prosecution 's request for mistrial .	in opening statements wednesday , defense attorney william costopoulos noted that orie spent six years as an assistant district attorney and nearly four more as a deputy state attorney general before becoming a lawmaker . "	you do n't prosecute cases without knowing what forensic evidence is all about , " costopoulos said .	the forgery " looks like the work product of a grade school student .	a fifth-grader at best . "	costopoulos said at last year 's trial that he could n't recognize the writings as forged .	but he told the jury wednesday that he agrees with u.s. secret service experts that the documents were forged ?	just not by his client .	costopoulos told the jury he does n't know who forged the documents , but said the prosecution ca n't say either .	the forgeries were either done " by somebody intending to do her harm , or to help her in a misguided thought process , " he said .	but deputy allegheny county district attorney lawrence claus told the jury that orie 's response has n't wavered since the " deep , dark , dirty secrets " of the alleged campaign corruption emerged in the fall of 2009 : " cover it up . "	orie is charged with theft of services , conflict of interest , evidence tampering and conspiring ?	with her sister , janine orie ?	to direct the senator 's state-funded staff to do campaign work for her and a third sister , joan orie melvin , in melvin 's judicial campaigns .	the alleged crimes date back to 2001 .	melvin is not charged .	janine orie , who was suspended from her $ 67,000-a-year job as melvin 's aide , was tried with the senator last year .	since the mistrial , she was also charged with directing melvin 's former superior court staff to do illegal campaign work when melvin unsuccessfully ran for the supreme court in 2003 and then won a seat in 2009 .	janine orie will be tried a second time but separately from the senator .	her trial has yet to be scheduled .	in his opening statements , the prosecutor told the jury the senator 's legislative office was " a full-time political campaign office . "	orie 's staff raised about $ 1.8 million in political contributions from 2001 until 2009 when an unpaid intern , jennifer rioja , complained to the da about legally suspect campaign work , claus said .	as he did in the first trial , costopoulos told the jury the political work amounted to nothing more than knocking on doors , putting up signs and sending out campaign donor " thank yous using state ink .

south carolina 's unemployment agency announced wednesday that it made a $ 60 million early payment toward its debt to the federal government , helping to reduce businesses ' insurance taxes .	the payment earlier this week is more than six months ahead of schedule , saving $ 1.4 million in interest costs .	it leaves a balance of $ 396 million on the state 's original debt of nearly $ 1 billion , according to the department of employment and workforce .	it marks the fourth year the state has made an early payment on the loan .	the state is still on track to pay the debt off next year .	the debt accumulated between december 2008 and april 2011 as the agency borrowed money to send unemployment checks amid climbing jobless rates , which peaked at 11.9 percent in december 2009 .	the state made its first payment on the debt in august 2011 . "	making this $ 60 million early loan payment could not be possible without the work of the state 's business community in improving south carolina 's economy faster than expected , " said agency director cheryl stanton .	beyond reducing interest , paying early ensures that the state avoids higher federal unemployment tax rates .	that allows for lower 2015 tax bills to businesses paying into the unemployment insurance trust fund , which had about $ 130 million in it wednesday .	the u.s. department of labor recommends that the state have $ 780 million in reserves , which represents a year 's worth of benefits paid , but the state must pay off its debt before it build its reserves .	gov. nikki haley also attributed the early payment to a better economy , saying it 's " exactly what is possible when a state sees the kind of economic growth and success that we have . "	the state 's unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in march .	but policy and legislative changes are a large part of how the state 's climbing out of debt .	other than chronically high unemployment , management problems contributed to the depleted trust fund and the need to borrow .	legislators approved a repayment plan in 2010 that increased employers ' rates as part of a law that overhauled the former employment security commission and made it a cabinet agency .	the rate increases caused a backlash from business owners hit with bills that soared by hundreds of dollars per worker .	both the agency and legislators have since clamped down on who can receive benefits , and for how long .	that includes a 2011 law cutting from 26 to 20 the maximum number of weeks the jobless can receive in state-governed benefits .	in 2012 , legislators required full , automatic denial of benefits for workers fired for misconduct , such as theft .	and internal policy changes set a four-week maximum of state-governed benefits to people who are fired for offenses that do n't meet the misconduct definition , such as tardiness and attendance issues .	the agency also has reduced overpayments , which include accidental and fraudulent , through a series of changes aimed at catching more errors and catching them faster .	the overpayment rate spiked to nearly 18 percent of all benefits paid in 2010-11 , or $ 69 million .	it has since dropped to 6 percent .	the 2010 law created a 20-tiered rate system in which businesses are billed according to their layoff history .	this year , employers with no claims pay about $ 11 per worker , while those with the worst unemployment records pay about $ 936 per worker yearly .

reports of sleeping air traffic controllers highlight a long-known and often ignored hazard : workers on night shifts can have trouble concentrating and even staying awake . "	government officials have n't recognized that people routinely fall asleep at night when they 're doing shift work , " said dr. charles czeisler , chief of sleep medicine at brigham and women 's hospital in boston .	czeisler said studies show that 30 percent to 50 percent of night-shift workers report falling asleep at least once a week while on the job .	so the notion that this has happened only a few times among the thousands of controllers " is preposterous , " he said in a telephone interview .	in a sign of growing awareness of the problem , the federal aviation administration said saturday it was changing air traffic controllers ' work schedules most likely to cause fatigue .	the announcement comes after the agency disclosed another incident in which a controller fell asleep while on duty early saturday morning at a busy miami regional facility .	according to a preliminary review , there was no impact to flight operations , the faa said .	czeisler said the potential danger is n't limited to air traffic controllers , but can apply to truck and bus drivers , airline pilots and those in the maritime industry .	who else ?	factory workers , police , firefighters , emergency workers , nurses and doctors , cooks , hotel employees , people in the media and others on night or changing shifts . "	we live in a very sleep-deprived society where many people are burning the candle at both ends , " czeisler said .	he said that a half-century ago , just 2 percent of people slept six hours or less per night ; today it 's 28 percent .	dr. william fishbein , a neuroscientist at the city university of new york , said that when people work odd shifts " it mucks up their biological rhythms . "	hormones are synchronized with the wake-sleep cycle .	when people change shifts , the brain never knows when it 's supposed to be asleep , so this affects how people function .	people who change shifts every few days are going to have all kinds of problems related to memory and learning , fishbein said .	this kind of schedule especially affects what he called relational memories , which involve the ability to understand how one thing is related to another .	in addition to drowsiness and inability to concentrate , people working night shifts are more subject to chronic intestinal and heart diseases and have been shown to have a higher incidence of some forms of cancer .	the world health organization has classified shift work as a probable carcinogen . "	we have 500 cable channels , we take work home with us on our blackberrys and computers , both work and entertainment options are available 24 hours a day seven days a week and there is much more and brighter light exposure in our homes in evenings , which affects hormones involved in sleep , czeisler said . "	and we are still trying to get up with the chickens because our work hours are starting earlier and earlier , " he said .	today , controllers are at the center of the firestorm , with recent reports that several planes could n't contact airport towers for assistance in landing .	members of congress are responding to a worried public , controllers have been suspended and the head of the government 's air traffic control system has resigned .	president barack obama told abc news that controllers must stay alert and do their jobs .	one old solution back in the news is allowing night workers to nap . "	there should be sanctioned on-shift napping .	that 's the way to handle night shift work , " said gregory belenky , a sleep expert at washington state university in spokane .	a nasa study suggested that pilots on long-distance flights would perform much better if given a chance to take a scheduled nap , as long the rest was planned and the both pilots did n't sleep at the same time . "	but even though that 's been known for decades , it 's never been allowed because we prefer to pretend that these things are not happening , " instead of managing the problem , czeisler said . "	we have a bury-our-head-in-the-sand attitude . "	controllers are often scheduled for a week of midnight shifts followed by a week of morning shifts and then a week on swing shifts .	this pattern , sleep scientists say , interrupts the body 's natural sleep cycles .	many of the federal aviation administration 's 15,700 controllers work schedules that allow no realistic opportunity for rest .	their record for errors on the job has grown sharply over the past several years .	faa rules prohibit sleeping on the job , even during breaks .	employees who violate them can be fired .	but controllers told the associated press that napping at night where one controller works two jobs while the other sleeps , and then they swap , is an open secret within the agency .	czeisler also is urging screening of truck drivers for sleep apnea , a breathing problem they can be prone to because many are obese .	he estimates that as many as 250,000 people in the u.s. doze off while driving every day , mostly in the daytime .	studies have shown that a sleep-deprived driver is as impaired as someone with enough alcohol in his blood to be considered a drunken driver .	even a drunk has some reflexes . "	if you fall asleep , your performance is much worse , " he said .

the virginia supreme court will consider whether the incest conviction of a former top adviser to martin luther king jr. should be thrown out because he died while his appeal was still pending .	the late rev. james bevel 's attorney is seeking what 's known as an abatement .	the idea behind abatement is that a conviction is not final until the appeals process is complete .	bevel had served a few months of a 15-year prison sentence when he was released on bond because he had pancreatic cancer .	he died in december 2008 at age 72 .	loudoun county circuit judge burke mccahill last year refused to abate the conviction after bevel 's victim ?	one of his 16 children ?	testified that she would be devastated if the case were wiped from the books . "	i wish i could just abate my memories and abate the whole experience , but the reality is it did happen , " bevel 's daughter , aaralyn mills , said at last year 's hearing .	the associated press does not usually identify victims of sex crimes , but mills has agreed to make her name public .	the virginia court of appeals last september affirmed mccahill 's decision .	bevel 's attorney , bonnie hoffman , said she continues to seek the abatement because she has an ethical duty to her client . "	his directions were to pursue the appeal , " she said in a telephone interview . "	so the next step is to pursue the abatement , which would give some of the same relief .	my obligations are to my client , and we will continue to fulfill and follow my client 's directions . "	the state supreme court will hear the arguments sept. 12 .	mills , whose abuse as a teenager in the 1990s was the subject of the trial , was among a group of bevel 's daughters who came forward in an effort to protect their youngest sister , who was then 11 .	the trial divided the family , with some members testifying for the prosecution and some for the defense .	according to testimony at the trial , bevel considered it the parents ' duty to " sexually orient " their children .	bevel was the architect of the 1963 children 's crusade in birmingham , ala. .	at the time of mills ' abuse , he was working closely with the virginia-based organization of political extremist lyndon larouche .

videos just coming to light show the crew of a navy aircraft carrier got an eyeful on shipboard tv : gay slurs , suggestive shower scenes and mimicked masturbation in clips made not by some sailor run amok but by the ship 's second-most powerful officer .	the navy said sunday it will investigate the " clearly inappropriate " videos shown through the nuclear-powered ship 's closed-circuit television system as part of an onboard movie night .	the star of the videos , made in 2006 and 2007 , is capt. owen honors , who now commands the uss enterprise but was its executive officer ?	the second in command ?	when the videos were made .	the norfolk-based enterprise was deployed in the middle east at the time the videos were made and is weeks from deploying again .	the virginian-pilot newspaper reported on the videos in its sunday editions and posted an edited version of one video on its website .	it 's not immediately known why the images are surfacing now .	the virginian-pilot quoted anonymous crew members who said they raised concerns aboard the ship about the videos when they aired , but they were brushed off .	but a former crew member who says she saw the videos while serving praised honors as " the best the navy has to offer " and said the skits were welcome entertainment onboard . "	it 's no worse then anything you 'd see on saturday night live or the family guy , " said houston native misty davis , who worked on the enterprise 's weapons systems during her 2006-2010 tour .	it 's clear from the videos that honors , who took over the ship 's command in may , had already gotten complaints when some of them were made . "	over the years i 've gotten several complaints about inappropriate material during these videos , never to me personally but , gutlessly , through other channels , " he said in the introduction to the video posted by the newspaper .	he goes on to use a derogatory term for gays and tells his critics : " this evening , all of you bleeding hearts ... why do n't you just go ahead and hug yourselves for the next 20 minutes or so , because there 's a really good chance you 're gon na be offended . "	next comes a sequence of what appear to be outtakes in which honors and others curse , followed by clips in which he and others are shown making hand motions that mimic masturbation .	honors segues to the next segment by saying , " finally let 's get to my favorite topic ... chicks in the shower .

"	executive officers and other leaders " are charged to lead by example and are held accountable for setting the proper tone and upholding the standards of honor , courage and commitment that we expect sailors to exemplify , " he said .	sims said u.s. fleet forces command " has initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the production of these videos . "	in a statement to the virginian-pilot on friday , however , the navy said it had put a stop to videos with " inappropriate content " on the enterprise several years ago . "	it is unfortunate that copies of these videos remained accessible to crewmembers , especially after leadership took action approximately four years ago to ensure any future videos reflected the proper tone , " the navy said .	it also said the videos " were intended to be humorous skits focusing the crew 's attention on specific issues such as port visits , traffic safety , water conservation , ship cleanliness , etc. " a phone listing for honors was not immediately available .	he is a 1983 alumnus of the u.s. naval academy and was a naval aviator before holding command .	he attended the u.s. naval fighter weapons school , also known as top gun .	the newspaper reported that the videos were made during the enterprise 's two six-month deployments to the middle east in 2006 and 2007 .	commissioned in 1961 , the enterprise is the world 's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier .	it is scheduled to sail two more deployments before it is decommissioned in 2013 .	it can carry a crew of more than 5,800 .	the commanding officer of the enterprise at the time the videos were made , lawrence rice , was later promoted to the rank of the rear admiral and had been assigned to the norfolk-based u.s. joint forces command , but is no longer there , a spokeswoman said .	the video posted by the newspaper included clips of past " movies " honors had made ?	including several statements in which he holds his higher-ups blameless for the material . "	as usual , the admiral and the captain have no idea about the contents of the video or movie this evening , and they should not be held accountable in any judicial setting , " honors says .

oct. 3 , 2011 state making major strides in improving infant health , well-being the michigan department of community health ( mdch ) recently announced an $ 8.4 million grant for home visiting programs in at-risk communities and the addition of severe combined immunodeficiency ( scid ) to the state 's newborn screening panel .	both measures should go a long way in ensuring the youngest members of our population have the opportunity to grow and thrive through adulthood .	the u.s. department of health and human services grant is for the state 's maternal , infant and early childhood home visiting program .	within the grant , there is more than $ 5.3 million in competitive grant funds and more than $ 3 million in formula grant funding .	this funding provides an opportunity to deliver evidence-based , early childhood home visiting services in order to aid families who need assistance and reside in at-risk communities .	home visiting is one of several strategies embedded in michigan 's comprehensive early childhood system .	the home visiting program is designed to promote maternal , infant and early childhood health , development and safety , school readiness , and strong parent-child relationships .	the data that influenced michigan 's grant proposal highlighted a host of issues that families in at-risk communities are currently experiencing .	those issues include poverty , unemployment , crime and domestic violence , child maltreatment , substance abuse , infant mortality and poor school outcomes .	according to olga dazzo , mdch director , the grant will be instrumental in expanding home visiting programs and for building the state infrastructure to enable these programs to provide quality services .	this is an important strategy for reducing infant mortality in michigan .	the newborn screening for scid will begin oct. 1 , and babies with this rare disorder can be diagnosed early enough to have life-saving treatment .	newborn screening uses a tiny sample of a baby 's blood to test for rare , hidden disorders that are difficult to diagnose , but may affect a child 's health and development .	scid is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that affects both males and females .	babies with scid appear healthy at birth , but if the disorder is not detected , infants can become sick quickly when exposed to common infections .	scid causes critically low levels of the white blood cells which protect the body from infection .	in infants with scid , even mild illnesses can become serious .	untreated infants rarely live beyond one year .	the scid screening is very important because this and related primary immunodeficiency disorders are so rare that most doctors have little to no experience diagnosing and treating them .	affected babies appear to have ordinary infections with common symptoms that are not clearly related to an immune system disorder .	without newborn screening , scid is unlikely to be diagnosed before a serious infection causes health problems , possibly becoming fatal .	babies with scid have the best chance of being cured through a bone marrow transplant if they are diagnosed and treated by 3 months of age .
the senate finance committee is considering a nearly $ 9 billion state operating budget , slightly more than the alaska house passed , slightly less than gov. sean parnell proposed .	differences between the house version and the one ultimately passed by the full senate will be settled in a conference committee .	the house passed its $ 8.9 billion spending plan with little fanfare though democrats tried unsuccessfully to get money back into it for such things as a pre-kindergarten pilot program .	among the more controversial aspects of the senate plan is a proposal to swap the $ 8.2 million that parnell requested for merit scholarships with the $ 1.1 million he put toward a program for students with financial needs .	parnell has seen this as an affront to one of his top legislative priorities , though concerns have been raised among lawmakers about whether students will have equal access to the classes they need to qualify for the merit scholarships .	there has been testimony , too , that the needs-based alaskadvantage program has been underfunded and unable to meet demands .	the senate bill also rejected requests by the governor to add a public records attorney to the department of law and allocate $ 175,000 for outside legal counsel to help with federal environmental litigation .	it also denied $ 3.6 million to begin preliminary operations of the goose creek correctional center .	leaders of the finance committee have expressed interest in auditing the prison after it was learned that running the facility would cost the state 3 ?	times what it now spends to outsource inmates to a colorado prison .	the overall proposal is about $ 10 million more than the house version and about $ 8.6 million less than parnell proposed , according to a legislative fiscal analysis .	the finance committee has been taking public comment on its plan .	the operating budget is only part of the state 's overall spending , albeit a large part .	lawmakers still must finish a supplemental spending bill to help address additional costs that have arisen this fiscal year , plus craft a capital budget for next year .	parnell has proposed an estimated $ 1.9 billion capital spending plan but that 's expected to grow ?	perhaps substantially ?	when lawmakers write their version .	the co-chairs of the senate finance committee have said they believe the state can afford a " healthy " capital budget , though they have also made clear their desire to see money put into savings first before the spending begins .
senate republicans are split over the immigration bill steaming toward approval at week 's end , a divide that renders the ultimate fate of white house-backed legislation unpredictable in the house and complicates the party 's ability to broaden its appeal among hispanic voters .	to some republicans , the strength of senate gop support for the bill is all but irrelevant to its prospects in the house .	conservatives there hold a majority and generally oppose a core provision in the senate measure , a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the united states illegally .	any such impact is " greatly overrated , " said missouri sen. roy blunt , who previously served as chief vote counter for house republicans .	but rep. paul ryan , r-wis. , offered a different view .	a senate vote on monday to toughen border security with thousands of new agents and billions of dollars in technology " obviously makes final legislation more likely , " the party 's 2012 vice presidential nominee said on cbs .	one prominent democrat , sen. chuck schumer of new york , also says house sentiment can be changed , particularly through the addition of strong border security measures of the kind that resulted from negotiations with previously uncommitted republicans . "	i believe a large bipartisan vote will wake up our colleagues ... in the house , " schumer said shortly before the senate inserted a requirement for 20,000 new border patrol agents and a total of 700 miles of fencing along the border with mexico . "	hopefully , as congressmen look how their senators voted , they will be influenced by it . "	in the key senate showdown so far , 15 republicans voted to advance the legislation that toughens border security at the same time it creates a chance at citizenship for 11 million immigrants living in the united states illegally .	another 27 voted to keep the bill bottled up .	republicans who voted to block the legislation generally did so after saying it would not deliver on its promise of operational control of the border . "	when you look at it , it does n't , and they know it , " sen. jeff sessions , r-ala. , said of the bill 's backers , who quickly disputed the charge .	a political pattern emerged , as well .	among republicans who are seeking a new term next year and as a result face the risk of a primary challenge , only three voted with supporters of the measure .	eight did not , a group that includes the party 's two top leaders in the senate , mitch mcconnell of kentucky and john cornyn of texas , as well as sessions , who has been one of the bill 's principal opponents across three weeks of debate .	while party leaders long have looked to immigration legislation as a way to broaden appeal among hispanic voters , individual members of congress report a different perspective . "	it 's hard to argue with the polling they 've been getting from the national level , " texas republican rep. kenny marchant said recently , referring to polls that show support for border security along with legalization .	yet in his own district in the suburbs west of dallas , he said , proposals along the lines of the senate bill are " very unpopular . "	the party 's potential presidential contenders also are split , likely a harbinger of a struggle in the campaign for the 2016 nomination .	two of them , sens. rand paul of kentucky and ted cruz of texas , oppose the legislation .	for his part , cruz took a verbal poke at fellow republicans in remarks on the senate floor on monday , saying that some senators in each parties " very much want a fig leaf " on border security to justify a vote for the measure .	yet one republican presidential hopeful , sen. marco rubio of florida , is a member of the so-called gang of eight , a bipartisan group that helped draft the bill .	among its provisions are several that impose conditions on immigrants seeking legal status , including payment of fines , pay outstanding taxes and undergo a background check .	in recent months , rubio has sought to reorder the political circumstances rhetorically , asserting that the status quo amounts to " de facto amnesty " for those in the country illegally since it is unlikely they will be forced to leave .	the phrasing marks an attempt to neutralize long-time claims that legalization confers amnesty .	increasing numbers of republicans now employ similar rhetoric .	among the unknowns is how much impact rubio and the other republicans in the gang of eight ?	sens. jeff flake and john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina ?	will have on house republicans whose votes will determine the fate of legislation to overhaul the immigration system .	rubio has met with members of the house republican leadership as well as with ryan and members of the conservative republican study group .	among house republicans , supporters of legalization in any form , citizenship or otherwise , is scarce , although blunt predicted there would be " an incredible amount of reasonableness " on that subject once lawmakers thought the border had truly been secured .	the house judiciary committee has approved two immigration bills recently , one of which echoes mitt romney 's suggestion in the 2012 presidential campaign that immigrants " self-deport " if they are in the country illegally .	it encourages immigrants living in the united states to " depart voluntarily " at their own expense .	neither of the bills cleared by the committee offers the prospect of legalization for immigrants in the country illegally , either citizenship or a step short of it .	house speaker john boehner , r-ohio , has pledged not to bring legislation to the floor for a vote that does not have the support of at least half the gop lawmakers in the chamber , a commitment made under pressure from restive conservatives that virtually rules out any measure envisioning legalization .	some gop lawmakers are hoping no immigration bill passes , to avoid the possibility of a final compromise with the senate that goes further than they want .	boehner also has said the entire house will " work its will " on the issue .	it 's a comment that takes into account the potential impact of house democrats , some of whom are already clamoring for a chance to vote on the bill that clears the senate this week .	republicans command a 234-201 majority , meaning that as few as 17 gop defections could change the outcome of any vote .	associated press writers chuck babington , donna cassata and erica werner contributed to this report .

dreams of a streetcar serving the nicholson drive corridor that connects downtown baton rouge to lsu may take years to become reality , but the capital area transit system is stepping up with a plan to fill the void .	the advocate reported ( http://bit.ly/1qclckq ) the parish bus system has decided to dedicate about $ 1.8 million in federal grants to the growing nicholson drive corridor .	the system , known as cats , received federal earmarks in 2006 for a service called bus rapid transit , which is a faster bus route with more buses making limited stops ?	often using a dedicated lane .	for years , cats had planned to use the money to provide the service on florida boulevard , but the grants sat dormant because the underfunded agency lacked the necessary 20 percent match .	now that cats has a dedicated funding source , it has turned its sights to nicholson drive in light of a recent push to build the streetcar line .	cats ceo bob mirabito said the funding includes about $ 823,000 for equipment that could be used for two buses and a shelter or station .	the remaining money is dedicated to design , engineering and planning .	he said the planning for the rapid transit service will be done with the eventual trolley in mind , an effort that should cut down some of the long-term planning costs .	plans for the streetcar were unveiled in february by john fregonese , the planner who is helping to implement the futurebr master land-use plan .	the cost of the project has been estimated at between $ 60 million and $ 100 million and the length of the route has ranged from 3.5 miles to 7.4 miles .	davis rhorer , director of the downtown development district , said the city-parish is already seeking federal grants , but he speculates the actual streetcar route could be four or five years away .	he said with new developments on nicholson and the creation of the water campus there will soon be a heavy demand for public transit on the road . "	it 's an urban response to suburban sprawl , " rhorer said . "	we must have efficient transportation to move people along . "	mirabito said the need for bus rapid transit services on florida boulevard was diminished because cats has already added a limited-stop service for that route .
the anglers of the au sable are n't what you 'd call a go-along , get-along gang .	dedicated to protecting the au sable river and its watershed , the 700-member organization has , at various times in its 25-year history , vilified politicians , shamed bureaucrats and sued the pants off those they perceived as threats to the river .	so in the latter half of 2010 ?	when awareness began to spread through the anglers ' ranks that enbridge energy partners , the company responsible for the 800,000 gallon oil spill in the kalamazoo river that july , had another aging pipeline handling up to 22 million gallons a day that crossed under their beloved trout stream near luzerne ?	you might have expected things to get prickly .	but they did n't .	instead , through a series of meetings and discussions between enbridge officials and leaders of the anglers , a somewhat unorthodox partnership was born .	one which has resulted in the company installing a remote-controlled shut-off valve at a cost of $ 300,000 - $ 500,000 on the south side of the river , visits to grayling by enbridge ceo patrick daniel and surprising praise for big oil from hard-line conservationists . "	when we began to consider the potential of an oil spill in the au sable ... it was horrific , " anglers president bruce pregler said this week . "	but ( the pipeline ) has been there for 60 years .	we decided we needed to reach out to them and express our concerns , " pregler said . "	the whole point ... was not to be adversarial .	we wanted to make sure they understood what kind of resource this is . "	john bebow , the group 's second vice president and head of the center for michigan think tank , said the anglers realized early on that they were n't going to get the pipeline shut down .	but they did want to know more about it , and what assurance enbridge could provide that the 2010 disaster in southern michigan would not be happen again .	while the enbridge pipeline that snakes under the au sable was not exactly a secret in the north woods , bebow said it was n't well known , either .	a few yards upstream from the parmalee bridge , " it 's marked as a pipeline , " he said , " but it 's not marked as an oil pipeline that is 3 feet around and handles millions of gallons of crude every day . "	bebow said that realization quickly developed into a desire to speak to enbridge .	while still in the middle of dealing with the kalamazoo river crisis , daniel , houston-based public affairs officer larry springer and other company officials agreed to sit down with the anglers .	in october 2010 , they met at gates au sable lodge outside of grayling , a sort of headquarters for the anglers and a clearinghouse for their annual fall river cleanup .	springer said enbridge was eager to connect .	the company regularly tries to interact with the communities through which its pipelines pass .	that usually means local elected officials and emergency responders .	but enbridge interacts with other groups , too , springer said , including environmentalists who loathe oil .	the anglers , however , " did n't want to just talk , " said springer , " they wanted to be involved " in addressing safety concerns .	in the months that followed , the discussions led to pregler and other anglers participating in disaster training with the company and local first responders , including a drill on the river itself last fall .	concerns raised by the anglers also contributed to enbridge 's decision to install an expensive shut-off valve near the south riverbank , replacing a manually controlled valve with one that can be operated almost instantaneously when a problem is detected from the company 's operations center in edmonton , alberta .	two years after the kalamazoo river spill , and in the same week a federal report excoriated enbridge for its failures to prevent and respond quickly enough to that spill , relations between the company and the au sable 's defenders appear pretty rosy .	it probably did n't hurt that both springer and his boss , daniel , are fly fishermen themselves .	springer even floated the river and caught a few trout .	in recent years , the anglers mounted legal challenges to oil and gas projects they perceived as threats to the river and its natural surroundings .	one was decided by the michigan supreme court -- and in the group 's favor .	but pregler , a troy-based attorney , said : " we do n't want to file lawsuits .	they 're expensive .	they take forever .	we 're just this humble little fishing club from grayling . " "	but we 'll do what we need to do to protect that watershed . "	springer said the company is fine with that approach .	the anglers have had " great ideas .	and they 've been very open and willing to share their ideas .	we 're more than satisfied . "	in the end , whatever their reasons , they have the same goal , springer said . "	the no. 1 thing we 're doing is trying to make sure we keep the oil in the pipeline . "

paper producer temple-inland inc. took responsibility wednesday for a huge fish kill on the pearl river that borders louisiana and mississippi , blaming a discharge from one of its paper mills .	in a statement , austin , texas-based temple-inland apologized " for the impact this issue at the mill has had on the pearl river . "	the company said it is working to remove the hundreds of thousands of dead fish and mussels and restore the river 's quality .	temple-inland said it shut down its bogalusa , la. , plant immediately on saturday after tests showed the plant would exceed its allowable output of discharge into the river .	the company said it immediately informed louisiana environmental officials of the problem and began working to restore the river 's water quality . "	we never lose sight that we are members and supporters of the bogalusa area and apologize for the impact this issue at the mill has had on the pearl river , its aqua culture and surrounding communities , " temple-inland chief executive doyle simmons said . "	we are working diligently and expeditiously to remove the fish kill and restoring the quality of the river . "	jay wilson , the company 's vice president of environment , safety and quality , said the discharge consisted mostly of water and residue of a substance known as " black liquor . "	black liquor is a byproduct of the process in which wood is converted to pulp .	most of the black liquor produced in bogalusa is used by the plant as an alternative fuel to generate steam , wilson said .	wilson said black liquor is biodegradable .	the problem with the river was not due to any toxicity , but the concentration of black liquor , which drained off the water oxygen supply following an extended period of hot temperatures , he said .	temple-inland hired an environmental cleanup company and , on wednesday , had 30 boats and about 100 people working to collect dead fish , which will be buried in a permitted landfill , wilson said .	the company was working with local , state and federal officials on the project , he said .	the mill remained closed wednesday .	in mississippi , authorities took action to bring fresh water into the river ?	and alleviate additional fish kills ?	by temporarily increasing discharges from the ross barnett reservoir near jackson .	the action late tuesday by the pearl river valley water supply district also was designed to dilute pollutants .	st. tammany parish and the louisiana governor 's office of homeland security and emergency preparedness set up a command post wednesday on the west pearl river .	parish president kevin davis said the environmental cleanup company would be hiring area residents to help with the cleanup .	wilson said he expected the cleanup to take several days .	on wednesday , the lake pontchartrain basin foundation said at least some pollution had entered the lake .	the foundation said that on tuesday , a 10-mile long line of white foam stretched from rigolets pass to bayou banfouca , scattering dead catfish .	however , the foundation said oxygen levels in the lake appeared normal . "	it is likely the foam and dead fish were carried by tides in normal lake water and may not indicate that significant polluted water has entered lake pontchartrain , " the foundation said in a statement .	scientists said the fish kill was likely due to a lack of water oxygen stemming from the pollution .	it likely will take several days for the additional discharge at the ross barnett reservoir to reach the affected area of the river , said trudy fisher , executive director of the mississippi department of environmental quality .	the reservoir was created by impounding the pearl river between madison and rankin counties in mississippi .	it was completed in 1965 and has since become a popular place for boating , sailing , camping and fishing .	john sigman , the water supply district 's general manager , said the increased discharges would have little effect on the reservoir , other than a slight decrease in the water level . "	we will return to normal discharge rates after we are able to determine the effects on the lower pearl river , " sigman said .	as of wednesday , the mississippi department of environmental quality said the kill stretched 35 miles to 40 miles along the river from bogalusa to the mississippi sound .	the agency said that the kill numbered hundreds of thousands of fish and mussels and has endangered species such as the gulf sturgeon , ringed sawback turtles and an endangered mussel .
authorities say a sunken tugboat will remain in the frigid saginaw river until at least next week .	u.s. coast guard officials tell the bay city times the 65-foot ann marie sunk this week , but is n't going anywhere until a salvage plan for the 81-ton vessel is approved .	lt. justin westmiller of the u.s. coast guard in detroit says the salvage plan needs approval from the captain of port in detroit , the ninth coast guard district in cleveland and the marine center in washington , d.c. .	the boat owned by frankfort-based luedtke engineering co. was tied up for the winter and empty when it sank .	westmiller said following the sinking about 800 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from the boat 's 5,000-gallon tank , which has been capped .
electricity customers in honolulu would pay the unknown cost of an expensive undersea power cable that has n't yet been approved , according to legislation approved by two house committees monday .	the bill establishes rules for constructing the cable , allowing the electric utility to collect surcharges from oahu ratepayers for cable installation , buy the cable after it 's built and work with the public utilities commission to develop the project .	the proposed undersea cable would link proposed wind farms on islands of molokai and lanai to the population center in honolulu , providing 400 megawatts of power and meeting about 20 percent of the oahu 's electricity needs .	the project , with an estimated cost between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion , is a key part of the state government 's initiative to reduce the islands ' dependence on foreign oil , but it has met with opposition from neighbor island residents concerned their rural communities will be altered for the benefit of urban honolulu . "	the utility wants the ratepayers to take all of the risk , " said henry curtis , director for the environmental group life of the land , in testimony before 16 representatives . "	they want to take not 1 percent of the risk for themselves , only part of the profit for collecting ratepayer money to pay for the cable . "	but scott seu of hawaiian electric co. said the legislation starts the process for finding a way to pay for the costly cable . "	it does provide a necessary framework to allow development of the undersea cable project in a way that balances the risks and provides certainty , " said seu , the utility 's vice president for energy resources .	the bill passed the house energy & environmental protection committee on a 5-2 vote , and the consumer protection & commerce approved it 11-1 .	it next advances to its final panel , the house finance committee .	the measure already passed the senate .	the cable would help hawaii become more energy independent by transporting plentiful wind resources on neighbor islands to where it 's most needed on oahu , said estrella seese , acting energy administrator for the state .	hawaii gets nearly 90 percent of its energy from foreign oil , but a state law calls for the islands to gather 70 percent of its power from clean sources by 2030 ?	40 percent from renewables and 30 percent from efficiency improvements . "	this bill is actually going to allow us to see the numbers on whether it is truly cost-effective for us to do this , " she said . "	this bill is n't guaranteeing that we 're establishing or constructing that cable .	it 's just the first step . "	if passed , the public utilities commission would then take control of the project 's implementation .	the commission could seek proposals from companies to build the cable , and their construction plans would include firm cost estimates , she said .	but curtis warned that those cost figures would remain confidential with the commission and secret from the public , leaving electric customers with the bill for a project that they do n't know the price of . "	we 're sure flying blind on this , " said rep. cynthia thielen , r-kaneohe-kailua , who voted against the bill .	construction on the cable could n't start until several environmental impact studies are completed , a process that includes public comment and review .	one of those studies , a $ 2.9 million programmatic environmental impact statement , is expected to be completed in april 2012 .	the cable could be built by the end of 2014 .

the scorebooks for the inaugural season of stamford 's girls ' varsity ice hockey program are closed .	but the team 's final 1-16 record does n't reflect the number of victories the 18 members of the fledgling team accomplished on and off the?ice . "	our first game was against greenwich , and they just whooped us 13-1 , and it was bad , " head coach eli williams said .	after the game , he encountered a locker room of upset?players . "	i was frightened .	two days later , we had a friday night practice and i thought , ' i do n't even know how many girls i 'll be able to get there now , ' " he recalled as he stood at the edge of the ice at terry conners rink during one of the team 's final practices thursday . "	but then i come in that friday night , and there they all are , " he said . "	smiling and ready to go .	just ready to learn and ready to make this thing?work . "	the team lost its second battle with greenwich , but the spread was cut in half , as greenwich prevailed 6-1 . "	it can be really hard playing those big teams , but we also learn from them , " said taylor ruther , a senior at stamford high and one of the team 's co-captains . "	when we lost that first game against greenwich , we did n't give up .	we learned by watching what they do , how they pass , how they set up .	it 's hard , but it 's also?good . "	it would be unrealistic to expect to win against a team like greenwich in the program 's first year , said cassie miolene , a freshman at westhill .	while there is a solid feeder program in greenwich and other neighboring towns such as new canaan , the youth hockey programs for girls in stamford are defunct , which poses a unique challenge to stamford girls who want to suit?up . "	we do n't have an actual program that 's feeding us and sending us girls .	right now , we need to find that program and start training girls in middle school at least , " miolene said . "	if we 're not doing that , and girls are just getting on the ice for the first time their freshman year , it 's going to be hard for them to get all the training they can and really build a?program . "	williams said there is a range of skill levels on the team .	but as word spreads about the opportunity to play for a high school team , and awareness increases , he said he hopes feeder programs will spring up and interest will increase .	he said his goal is to break .500 within four?years . "	good things never come easy .	never .	opportunity comes with overalls and a hardhat sometimes , and you 've just got to give everything you 've got and it will work out , " he?said .	and that 's just what he 's seen from his athletes in the months since the season?began . "	the work ethic and what they 'll be able to take away from this is just incredible .	they 'll be able to do anything they want in life .	i know that , just from them showing me how hard they work out there ; if they work that hard at anything , they can do whatever they want , " he?said .	the team 's only win came halfway through january when stamford beat west haven 8-6 .	after the game clock ticked away the final seconds , the stamford team remained by the bench staring , williams?said . "	i was like , ' get out there !	go celebrate ! ' "	he said , laughing . "	it was great to see their faces after that .	we made history .	it 's the first-ever win for varsity hockey for the girls , so they should be proud of?that . "	while it took a whole team to win , williams pointed out that the team 's goalie , senior sarah ehrlich , made 47 saves in that?game .	stopping 47 pucks from flying into the back of the net is no small feat ; that 's about twice as many pucks as the average fairfield county interscholastic athletic conference goalie swats away per game .	but that 's a typical day in the net for ehrlich .	she made 86 saves during a face-off with neighboring darien .	that 's two saves each minute of the?game . "	really ?	two saves a minute ?	i guess that is a lot , " ehrlich said as she stood near the team 's bench after working with a younger goalie on a recent day . "	i mean , it was definitely tiring .	i was dead , and it 's an awesome feeling to be like , ' i saved 86 shots .

the michigan house on thursday narrowly approved legislation that would cut state aid to public schools , community colleges and universities for the budget year that begins in october .	the measure passed 57-53 in the republican-led chamber mostly along party lines , with six members of the gop joining democrats in opposition .	it was a politically difficult vote for many lawmakers , assailed by education groups that are fiercely lobbying against the cuts .	republicans who voted for the measure acknowledged the vote was tough , but said it was necessary . "	today was a very difficult vote , " said house speaker jase bolger , a republican from marshall . "	it 's never easy to contain spending . "	the republican-led senate has passed its own version of education spending cuts for next budget year .	differences between the two versions must be reconciled before a plan can become law , meaning lawmakers will have to vote on education funding plans again before they wrap up budget votes for the year .	the house proposal would cut the state 's per-student foundation grant by an additional 3.5 percent , with cuts ranging from $ 256 to $ 297 per student .	that 's on top of a $ 170 per student cut that 's already in place and would be continued into next fiscal year .	community college funding would be cut by 15 percent and universities would lose at least 15 percent of their state aid under the house plan .	cuts would be even deeper for universities that do n't keep tuition increases under roughly 7 percent headed into next academic year .	universities also would be penalized an additional 5 percent of their state aid if they extend health benefits to unmarried domestic partners of university employees .	house democrats are steadfastly against the education cuts , saying they 're unnecessary .	but republicans have a 63-47 edge in the house .	republicans joining the democrats in opposition to the education spending bill were hugh crawford of novi , kurt heise of plymouth , holly hughes of montague , andrea lafontaine of richmond township , pat somerville of new boston and dale zorn of ida .	democrats are opposed to republican plans that would take money typically used for k-12 schools to help support budgets for community colleges and universities .	if the money was left in the school aid fund , democrats said , k-12 funding would not be cut because there 's a surplus in the account .	republican gov. rick snyder wants to move toward funding universities and community colleges from the school aid fund .	snyder has proposed an additional per student cut of $ 300 in the k-12 system , on top of the existing $ 170 per student reduction .	the senate approved a plan with additional per student cuts of $ 170 , making the total cut $ 340 per student .	snyder proposed holding community college funding even with this fiscal year 's levels .	the senate voted to cut community college funding by an average of 3.4 percent .	operating funds for universities would be cut by 15 percent under snyder 's plan and the senate plan .	some lawmakers are hopeful they 'll be able to lessen the projected cuts to public schools after state economists meet for an official revenue estimating conference on may 16 .	it 's possible the state may have roughly $ 500 million more in revenue than thought just a few months ago , but that wo n't be official until economists compare numbers and forecast them into the next fiscal year .	democrats said there was no reason to vote on the cuts thursday . "	wait 10 days , " said rep. tim melton , a democrat from auburn hills . "	wait 240 hours .	wait and get a clearer picture . "	snyder has said lawmakers should not bank on having a surplus available .	even if the money materializes , snyder said , education is not the only option for using the money .	snyder has noted the state 's budget stabilization or " rainy day " fund is low .	at roughly $ 2.2 million , snyder said it would cover state spending for only about 30 minutes .	snyder wants to cut business taxes while also erasing an overall budget deficit projected at about $ 1.4 billion a few months ago .

hacking into celebrity phones was just the tip of the iceberg .	britain 's media ethics inquiry , set up in response to illegal eavesdropping by a rupert murdoch-owned tabloid , has turned out to be a masterclass in skullduggery that has exposed the murky practices of the u.k. 's muckraking press .	this week , witnesses described how murdoch 's company had wreaked havoc on their lives and those of their families , with reporters targeting critics for spying and negative coverage and sullying the name of an innocent man . "	we have a press that has just become frankly putrid in many of its elements , " alastair campbell , former tabloid journalist and longtime communications aide to former prime minister tony blair , told the tribunal this week .	few would disagree after listening to the nationally televised testimony describing the excesses of a callous and sometimes criminal press .	the judge-led inquiry was set up after it emerged that murdoch 's news of the world had for years illegally eavesdropped on the voicemail messages of celebrities , public figures and crime victims .	the scandal forced murdoch to shut down the 168-year-old tabloid .	a dozen murdoch employees have been arrested in the case , which also cost the jobs of several of his top executives , two senior police officers and prime minister david cameron 's communications chief .	the inquiry has put murdoch 's empire on trial , as witnesses described their treatment at the hands of an organization they viewed as unassailably powerful , ruthless and feared .	former child singing sensation charlotte church described how she was invited to perform at murdoch 's wedding on a yacht in new york when she was 13 .	she said she was offered a 100,000 pound ( roughly $ 160,000 ) payment , but was told if she waived the fee that murdoch 's papers would look favorably on her .	church , now 25 , told the inquiry that she really wanted to take the money , but was told by her managers it would be worthwhile to give up the fee ?	which would have been her highest payment ever then ?	to cultivate murdoch 's support .	she said she was told " that he was a very , very powerful man " who could do her career a world of good ?	if he wanted to .	but any tabloid goodwill she earned was short-lived .	church said media scrutiny increased to unbearable levels as she entered her teens .	as she approached her 16th birthday , she said murdoch 's the sun tabloid featured on its website a " countdown clock " timed to the day when she would be able to legally have sex ?	an allegation the newspaper denies .	later , a tabloid reported that church was pregnant before she had even told her parents , news she felt had to come either from surveillance or phone hacking .	on another occasion the news of the world reported on her father 's extramarital affair under the headline " church 's three in a bed cocaine shock . "	church said her mother had attempted suicide partly as a result of this invasion of privacy .	murdoch 's news international has denied church 's version of events surrounding her performance at murdoch 's wedding , and her agent at the time , jonathan shalit , said she was not offered a choice between a fee and good press .	he said church was not offered a fee and performed for free , as she had done for prince charles and president bill clinton .	but he said publicity from these appearances helped launch her career in the united states , which was his plan . "	when you sing for these people you get added benefits for your career , " he said .	church was one of a slew of celebrities , including actor hugh grant , " harry potter " author j.k. rowling and actress sienna miller , who have sat in the witness box at london 's royal courts of justice and described stakeouts and snatched photos , leaked medical details and midnight pursuits ?	all justified , in the tabloids ' eyes , because the people they were pursuing were famous .	ian hargreaves , professor of digital economy and former director of the journalism school at the university of cardiff , said the hearings have had a profound impact on the public psyche ?	and on britain 's political class ?	by revealing so much about how part of the press works . "	it 's been a process of revelation , based on firsthand testimony , " he said . "	a lot of journalists feel it has been one-sided , but processes that have been known about and talked about in private are suddenly being talked about on a big public stage . "	hearings continue into the new year , and justice brian leveson and his panel hope to issue a report by late 2012 that could recommend major changes to britain 's system of media self-regulation .	so far , the most strident defense of tabloids ?	and the week 's most jaw-dropping testimony ?	came from unrepentant former news of the world journalist paul mcmullan .	he described chasing celebrities ' cars as " good fun , " called phone hacking " a perfectly acceptable tool " of the trade and dismissed privacy as " the space bad people need to do bad things in . "	he also said celebrities should stop complaining and be grateful for the attention of paparazzi .	the inquiry has also shown that it 's not just celebrities who find themselves in the tabloids ' sights .	the parents of 13-year-old milly dowler , who was abducted and murdered in 2002 , described how the news of the world 's hacking of milly 's phone , and the deletion of voicemail messages , had given them false hope that their daughter was still alive .	this week christopher jefferies , a retired teacher arrested on suspicion of murder in a high-profile case a year ago , described how his life had been wrecked by " smears , innuendo and complete fiction " in articles that painted him as a voyeuristic eccentric , or worse .	jefferies was released without charge , and another man has been convicted of the killing .	jefferies successfully sued eight newspapers ?	including murdoch 's the sun tabloid ?	for libel , but said he would " never fully recover from the events of the last year . " "	there will always be people who do n't know me who will retain the impression that i 'm some sort of weird character who is probably best avoided , " he said .	the inquiry has also heard claims the murdoch empire used negative articles and even espionage against its critics .	former tv host anne diamond recounted how she had asked murdoch during a 1980s interview " how could he sleep at night " knowing his newspapers ruined people 's lives .	she said after that " there were consistent negative stories about me in mr. murdoch 's newspapers . "	one glaring example was a story in the sun headlined " anne diamond killed my father , " about a fatal road accident she had been involved in years before .	the same newspaper took pictures of diamond carrying the coffin of her infant son at his funeral , despite her plea for the press to stay away out of respect for the family 's grief .	mark lewis , a lawyer who has represented high-profile hacking victims , testified that he was put under surveillance by a private investigator working for murdoch 's news international .	the surveillance , apparently in search of material to discredit him , included following and filming his 14-year-old daughter . "	that was truly horrific , that my daughter was videoed , was followed by a detective with a camera , " lewis said . "	that should n't happen to anybody 's child . "

democrats assemble tuesday to re-nominate barack obama for the presidency , to sell him as the wise and humane alternative to republican challenger mitt romney , a pitch that will be repeated endlessly over the next two months to an american electorate that is more politically divided than at any time in at least a quarter century .	as they watch the political stagecraft , there may be only one thing all americans can agree on : deep concern over the struggling american economy that has made only a halting recovery from the great recession and near meltdown of the u.s. financial sector just before obama took office 3 1/2 years ago .	through the course of the democratic national convention this week , obama and his party will be fighting romney 's argument that the president has failed and will only lead the country deeper into debt and economic despair .	that was the republican theme at their national convention last week in tampa , florida .	for his part , obama set the tone for the democratic gathering in charlotte , north carolina , declaring monday that romney 's governing prescriptions are something out of the past century . "	despite all the challenges that we face in this new century , we saw three straight days of an agenda out of the last century .	it was a rerun .	you might as well have watched it on black-and-white tv , " obama told an audience of auto workers in toledo , ohio .	obama is making a slow circuit of campaign stops in key battleground states before coming to north carolina later in the week to accept his re-nomination .	later monday , obama broke off the campaign trail to console victims of hurricane isaac along the flooded louisiana coast .	he vowed government officials would find out " what can we do to make sure it does n't happen again . "	at times like these , " nobody 's a democrat or a republican , we 're all just americans looking out for one another , " said the president , flanked by local and state officials from both parties , after inspecting some of the damage inflicted by the storm and hugging some of its victims .	romney paid a similarly nonpartisan visit last friday to the flooded region but made no reference at the time to federal aid .	obama has been and will be arguing that romney brings nothing more to his quest for the white house than plans and policies that are a reprise of those employed by former republican president george w. bush , under whose watch the great recession began and the financial collapse occurred .	most americans still hold bush responsible for the start of the economic difficulties afflicting the u.s. , but they are split on which candidate is best equipped to return the country to robust growth .	obama foresaw the difficulties he faced in a chicago speech on the cold night of his victory as the nation 's first african-american president nearly four years ago . "	the road ahead will be long , " he said solemnly that november night in chicago , displaying none of the euphoria of his supporters . "	our climb will be steep .	we may not get there in one year , or even one term .	but , america , i have never been more hopeful than i am tonight that we will get there . "	that 's a message obama will have to repeat vigorously under attack from romney who contends the president is a nice guy who has failed to make things better .	the republican candidate drew a line under that message in a statement monday , the u.s. labor day holiday that celebrates workers and marks the unofficial end of the summer holiday season .	romney said the holiday was " a chance to celebrate the strong american work ethic , " but added : " for far too many americans , today is another day of worrying when their next paycheck will come . "	romney will be hitting hard on his business expertise as co-founder of bain capital , a private equity firm through which he amassed a quarter-million dollar fortune .	polls show most americans see romney as the better candidate to handle the u.s. economy .	obama is seen as by far the most likable and better able to understand the problems of ordinary americans .	overall the two candidates are in one of the closest presidential contests in recent u.s. history .	their vision of america 's future differs across the board and , perhaps , the subtexts in that regard will be the deciding factor .	obama will be pressing hard on his contention that there are and will be vast areas where the government can help fix the economy and put a safety net under americans who have been hard hit in the aftermath of the steep downturn .	he 's finally pushing hard in support of the health care overhaul he pushed through more than two years ago .	it was based on a plan instituted by romney when he was governor of massachusetts , although the republican candidate now promises to repeal obama 's version for the nation .	obama is pressing for higher taxes on americans making more than $ 250,000 a year .	romney wants to keep bush-era tax cuts in place , with even steeper cuts for high-income earners .	obama argues his plan will help bring down the u.s. debt .	romney says his ideas will do that even better by causing businesses to make more money and pay even more in taxes even though the rate is lowered .	obama is pressing to keep alive the medicare program , the much-loved government health insurance program for americans over age 65 .	romney ?	adopting the budget proposals of his running mate , rep. paul ryan ?	favors converting the program to a system where retirees receive a government voucher that they can use in buying insurance on the private market .	obama contends that will end medicare " as we know it , " further accelerating republican efforts to privatize social programs for the elderly , disabled and poor .	on foreign policy , romney notably did not once mention the ongoing war in afghanistan in his speech last thursday accepting his party 's nomination .	obama , polls show , is seen as far more capable of handling u.s. foreign policy , and he will no doubt hit that hard when he speaks thursday night at an outdoor football stadium in charlotte .	he will recall that he ended the war in iraq at the end of last year , as promised , and will put an end to the u.s. combat mission in afghanistan in 2014 .	and he holds a powerful trump card : his decision to order the daring navy seal raid that killed terrorist mastermind osama bin laden at his hideout deep in pakistan .	vice president joe biden , speaking to workers in detroit on monday , said he could put it all on a bumper sticker . "	osama bin laden is dead , general motors is alive . "	both obama and biden played heavily to american workers in their labor day speeches , particularly to those whose jobs depend on the auto industry .	obama injected that industry with huge amounts of government money in the earliest days of his administration , preventing general motors and chrysler corp. from likely going out of business , resulting in more than 1 million workers losing their jobs .	romney opposed the auto bailout and accuses obama of profligate government spending that he contends has done little to lift the country out of the economic morass .	as they wrestle over the role of government , when all the chaff is separated out , voters will be left with a decision about which candidate 's vision best accords with their view of the nation .	obama will argue government does and can help the people who pay taxes to keep it in operation .	romney will counter that government is too involved in americans ' lives and that everyone will be better off under his leadership , one designed , he says , to minimize federal involvement .	it 's a classic democratic versus republican argument but one that 's bulked up as if on steroids of late as the deeply conservative tea party movement gains increasing control over the republican party with demands for lower taxes and smaller government .

lawyers for the state and a union representing prison guards argued in court thursday over the legality of a budget proviso calling for the privatization of 29 state correctional facilities in 18 south florida counties .	each side asked state circuit judge jackie fulford for a summary judgment in its favor .	the case is likely to be appealed regardless of how she rules .	republican legislative leaders say privatization would cut spending on the affected prison facilities by at least 7 percent .	the police benevolent association contends those claims are bogus , but its lawsuit is based on other issues .	union lawyers representing one of 3,800 members who could lose their jobs due to the privatization plan argued the 23-page proviso violates state law and various provisions of the florida constitution .	that includes a ban on including measures in the state budget that do n't relate to appropriations for current expenses .	the proviso covers a different subject and should have been filed as a separate bill because it changes existing law , said union lawyer kelly overstreet johnson .	she said it 's a textbook example of what the constitution intended to prevent . "	a few powerful legislators pushed through significant policy changes to these statutes by proviso at the last minute , thus avoiding all possibility for public comment , " johnson said .	assistant attorney general jonathan glogau argued the proviso is valid because it 's related to state spending and that existing law requiring cost-benefit analyses and other preliminary steps pertains to privatization proposals by the department of corrections , not those that originate in the legislature . "	the agency did n't ask for it ; so what , " glogau said . "	agencies do n't tell the legislature what to do . "	glogau said lawmakers fund plenty of things agencies do n't request including the florida version of special interest spending known as " pork " or " earmarks " in the halls of congress . "	in some instances we call them ' turkeys , ' " he said . "	you can argue that 's not a good idea , that 's not a good way to do legislating , that 's not a good way to make a budget , but there 's nothing unconstitutional about it . "	another union lawyer , m. stephen turner , argued the proviso violated gov. rick scott 's constitutional line-item veto authority because it was not attached to a specific item in the budget .	glogau disagreed .	he said scott , who generally supports privatization , could have vetoed the entire department of corrections budget if it did n't like the proviso .	he cited the florida supreme court 's 1980 opinion in brown v. firestone . "	brown says that the legislature and governor can play a high-stakes game of chicken over the budget and there is not a constitutional problem with that , " glogau said .	glogau urged fulford to resolve the case with a summary judgment rather than hold a trial because there are no factual disputes , just legal issues .	if the case does go to trial , the union is prepared to call former corrections secretary edwin buss as a witness .	scott forced buss to resign in august only six months after hiring him from indiana where he had headed that state 's prison system .	under pre-trial questioning by lawyers , buss said he was asked to sign off on a business plan for the privatization two months after the budget was passed .	he said he signed it but that he would n't say he approved it .
a liberal-leaning advocacy group wants legislative leaders to formally scrutinize pay raises of some young staffers in north carolina gov. pat mccrory 's administration .	progress nc action sought the investigation wednesday after delivering what it called a petition with 19,000 names to the office of health and human services secretary aldona wos ( vahsh ) .	the group wants wos to rescind $ 20,000-plus raises to two department workers in april .	spokesman ricky diaz and policy adviser matt mckillip make more than $ 80,000 .	both worked on mccrory 's campaign last year .	progress nc action leader gerrick brenner says the raises are wrong when teachers did n't get pay increases this year and medicaid has cost overruns .	mccrory has defended the raises .	wos told wral-tv ( http://bit.ly/1btuvms ) her agency 's payroll is $ 21 million less than a year ago .

"	monday 's flurry of meetings caps months of fruitless negotiations over how to close a roughly half-billion-dollar shortfall for the two-year budget cycle ending june 2013 .	a republican-led coalition in the senate will not take up the budget until lawmakers approve a series of policy changes in state government .	gregoire spokesman cory curtis said the proposal addressed three issues that have kept lawmakers at odds : pensions , a balanced budget measure and altering health insurance benefits for public school employees . "	she gave them her go-home proposal , " he said .	democrats hold power in the house and have been unwilling to embrace the gop bills that passed the senate saturday , one that would require the state 's two-year budget to be in line with anticipated revenue over a four-year period and another to alter health insurance benefits for k-12 employees .	senate majority leader lisa brown , d-spokane , said earlier monday that she was frustrated by what she said was republicans ' insistence that the house pass the reform bills approved by the senate before they can start negotiating the budget . "	i feel like we 've been put in a box that 's intended to drive us into another special session , " she said .	the 30-day special session is set to end at midnight tuesday , but the coalition of senate republicans and three democrats that passed a budget plan by a single vote last month is down a vote through the rest of the overtime session .	sen. rodney tom of medina was among the democrats voting for the republican budget last month .	that budget proposal stalled in the house and lawmakers were forced into an overtime session .	tom was in california on a college tour with his daughter ?	something he said they planned in january ?	and is n't supposed to finish his travels until wednesday .	he said any agreement to break the logjam in the legislature will have to be bipartisan , so his vote will not be crucial to final passage . "	it 's all going to be part of a package , " tom said . "	if there 's a package agreement , it 's going to be very bipartisan . "	the rest of the chamber 's 48 senators were all present or expected at the capitol monday .	among them was senate minority leader mike hewitt of walla walla , who is recovering from major surgery to remove a tumor from his abdomen .	hewitt said that he thought it was important to be present in the senate for votes on reform-related bills that republicans have said must be part of any budget deal . "	i 'm not here to do battle , but i 'm here to finish up the task we started this year , " he said .	hewitt says doctors removed a thymoma tumor in its entirety , and his prognosis is good , though he 's still in pain from the surgery .
two 1.5 kilowatt wind turbines have been installed atop the 17-floor reno city hall as part of the city 's push to promote renewable energy .	jason geddes , city energy administrator , said the top of city hall is an ideal location for turbines because nearby tall buildings create a wind tunnel virtually all the time .	a third installation also is planned . "	when we first started doing this several years ago , i never dreamed we would be doing it on top of city hall , " councilman dave aiazzi said .	in all , reno officials plan to install nine turbines throughout the city to test their performances in different environments .	four others , in a city park and sewer plant , have already been erected , and two more will go on a parking garage .	the nine turbines and several solar projects are expected to save the city 788,932 kilowatt hours a year for an annual savings of $ 91,000 a year .	the investment should pay for itself in nearly 19 years , geddes said .	the turbines are part of the city 's $ 19 million energy efficiency and renewable energy initiative .	at a rooftop ceremony wednesday , mayor bob cashell said reno is the first u.s. city to place such turbines on top of its city hall .	but a boston spokesman said thursday that a 1.9 kilowatt turbine has stood atop its city hall since 2008 .	christine real de azua , spokeswoman for the american wind energy association , said her washington , d.c.-based group does not track small turbine installations by site and was unsure whether any other cities had turbines atop city hall .	reno also claims it 's the first in the country conducting research to test the strengths and weaknesses of the turbines .	the information will be reported to the u.s. energy department . "	the new testing facilities across the country will play a very important role in the small-wind industry , especially as it continues to grow at such fast rates , " said ron stimmel of the american wind energy association .

higher rates appear likely for users of kodiak 's city-owned shipyard because it continues to lose money .	the 3-year-old shipyard lost more than $ 300,000 in the last fiscal year , and now the kodiak port and harbor advisory board has agreed that rate increases are needed to balance the books , the kodiak daily mirror ( http://is.gd/pqxolb ) reported wednesday .	kodiak 's shipyard is considered a do-it-yourself operation where the city provides space for ship owners to work on their boats using contractors based in the city .	the rate increase discussion came tuesday as harbormaster marty owen presented the harbor department 's fiscal year 2012 report .	the harbor department operates the kodiak shipyard and the harbor department under separate accounts , but the shipyard has repeatedly run in the red since it began operations in october 2009 .	according to financial records provided by owen , the shipyard posted a loss of $ 302,000 in fiscal year 2012 , which ended june 30 .	in the previous fiscal year , the shipyard lost $ 281,000 .	during the same period , the number of boats using the yard rose from 49 in to 54 .	erasing the deficit and making the shipyard self-supporting would require doubling the shipyard 's rates , deputy harbormaster lon white said .	the shipyard now charges $ 2.20 per foot per day for boat storage .	board member stormy stutes said doubling that fee would n't be unreasonable . "	if you doubled the rate , i 'm serious , it 's not prohibitive , " he said .	the board asked owen to draft a stair-step proposal where fees for various services would be raised over a set period until the shipyard breaks even .
three decades ago a 14-year-old student walked into a kansas junior high school armed with an assault rifle and started firing , killing the school 's principal and wounding two teachers and a student .	on thursday , the widow of goddard junior high school principal james mcgee joined educators from newtown , connecticut 's sandy hook elementary school to dedicate a memorial to educators ?	administrators , teachers , bus drivers and custodians alike ?	who have been killed while performing their duties , the emporia gazette ( http://bit.ly/1ithein ) reported .	the memorial to fallen educators , located next to the national teachers hall of fame on the emporia state university campus , will ensure mcgee and at least 112 other educators whose lives ended on duty are n't forgotten , said crystal mcgee , who attended the dedication ceremony with two of her husband 's siblings and two of his children . "	i think that is one of the hard things about loss , " mcgee said . "	you lose somebody you love and you see the world going on .	so it is important to families to know that the world did stop for a moment to remember him . "	the december 2012 sandy hook shootings , in which six educators and 20 students were fatally shot by a 20-year-old assailant , were the motivation for the memorial , said jennifer baldwin , administrative assistant for the national teachers hall of fame .	staffers researched educator deaths all the way back to 1764 , where they found the first documented slaying of a teacher , she said .	the 113 names on the memorial are what researchers were able to find , but there undoubtedly are more , baldwin told the associated press on friday ?	including two new ones that came in since thursday 's dedication . "	doing research , you can find thousands of pages of information about who did the shootings , but you might find two tiny paragraphs about the educators who were killed , " she said . "	we are trying to change that . "	those listed on the memorial died in a variety of ways while performing their roles as educators , baldwin said , including teachers killed in tornadoes , custodians electrocuted while on the job or bus drivers killed in crashes .	one of the main criteria for inclusion is that the educator was on the job at the time of death , she said .	for example , of four educators on american airlines flight 77 when it crashed into the pentagon on 9/11 , three who were on a school-sanctioned field trip are included on the memorial while the fourth , who was on vacation , is not , baldwin said .	liesl fressola , a sandy hook elementary teacher , tearfully read the names of the six teachers who were killed in the dec. 14 , 2012 , massacre .	among them was victoria soto , her closest friend at the school . "	i would much rather be here tomorrow to induct her and my other colleagues into the national teachers hall of fame , " fressola said in a written statement . "	but that will never happen . "

there would be no more early-august starts for mississippi public schools under a bill lawmakers are considering .	house bill 707 , as amended tuesday by the senate education committee , would require that schools start no earlier than the third monday in august , which would be anywhere from aug. 15 to aug. 21 .	advocates say that pushing back the beginning of school means families would be likely to take more summer trips , pumping money into the state 's tourism industry .	they say a delayed start also means schools would spend less on air conditioning and students would swelter less in sports , in band and on school buses .	opponents say the bill strips away local autonomy and that helping the tourism industry is a bad reason to change the school calendar . "	i do n't have a problem if the local districts want to do it , but they do n't want it , " said sen. videt carmichael , r-meridian .	the gulf coast business council , a gulfport-based business group , has been pushing the issue for a number of years .	the council wrote in a 2010 study that a later start date would raise tourism spending by $ 100 million in mississippi , as well as create another $ 40 million in indirect benefits , as money is passed through the economy . "	the business community is engaged in this issue based on the very significant economic impact on tourism , " said jack norris , the council 's president , who added the issue bubbled up from individual tourism businesses that are council members .	the council also cites a fall 2011 survey of 1,000 mississippians that showed 84 percent support for delaying the start of school , and says that it could find no impact on academic achievement in the dozen states that have laws regulating start dates . "	it 's not an issue academically , " agreed state schools superintendent tom burnham .	he said that concern about how hot it is in august is " valid . "	proponents say air conditioning costs more in august , athletes and band members suffer during outdoor practice , and most school buses are not cooled . "	when it reaches aug. 4 and we have to go to school , parents , teachers and kids are not actually in education mode , " said sen. brice wiggins , r-pascagoula .	sam bounds , executive director of mississippi association of school superintendents , opposes the bill .	he said one reason for early-august starts is the increase in number of school days .	he also said that a stretched-out calendar with more holidays gives teachers and students more breathers . "	it 's about local control , " said bounds .	the house bill originally required a start date no earlier than the fourth monday in august , but the senate amended it to the third monday .	burnham warned that starting on the fourth monday could mean that students would attend school into june , if bad weather forced makeup days .	the bill includes a two-year transition , which burnham said was necessary to negotiate a delay in state testing and to rework athletic schedules .	one problem posed by a late start is that it may push the end of the first semester into january .	if semesters are n't equal , students who only take a subject for one semester would not get equal amounts of instruction time .

after more than 30 years owning a furniture and an antiques business , mark zimmerman is melancholy about his retirement .	zimmerman founded the sugar loaf furniture business in winona , which closed in 2003 .	he opened sugar loaf antiques & crafts at the location in 2006 , then reopened the furniture store in 2010 after the building failed to sell .	before becoming a furniture store and antique mall , the property was the home of the peter bub brewery , which zimmerman worked at in the 1950s .	founded in 1862 , the brewery had a more than 100-year run before closing in 1969 , with the brewery properties weathering two devastating fires in 1872 and 1882 .	because of all that history , zimmerman is sad to go .	but after he survived a heart attack last year , both zimmerman and his daughter , geri corey , are looking to retire , the winona daily news ( http://bit.ly/1toxw2k ) reported . "	i 'm getting older , " said zimmerman . "	you have to retire at some point .

democratic gubernatorial candidate bob etheridge tried to build financial transparency into a campaign issue wednesday when he released his income tax returns , and called on other candidates ?	most notably republican pat mccrory ?	to do the same .	etheridge , who served seven terms in congress and eight years as state schools superintendent , gave the media his 2009 and 2010 federal and state returns as he turned in candidate paperwork at the state board of elections in raleigh to officially enter the race .	etheridge and republican scott a. jones of pleasant garden filed before the noon filing deadline , raising to 13 the number of candidates running to succeed gov. beverly perdue , who is n't seeking re-election .	there are six democrats , six republicans and libertarian barbara howe .	candidates for state office and elected officials already must file economic disclosure statements with the state ethics commission .	mccrory has said he wo n't release his tax returns , calling them his private records , and said he 's already given ample information on his statement of economic interest .	the paperwork , however , does n't provide much detail about the value of a candidate 's individual assets or how much money the candidate has made .	gubernatorial candidates historically have n't released their tax returns in north carolina .	etheridge , who plans to release his 2011 returns when they are available , invited all candidates for governor to go further in the name of transparency , but singled out mccrory in a news conference . "	i think it is incumbent on any person running for the state 's highest position to go beyond what is required by law , " etheridge told reporters . "	if pat mccrory thinks that openness and transparency is not important , then let him explain that to the citizens of north carolina . "	the state democratic party has been pushing mccrory to provide information about his clients while he 's worked for consulting and law firms since he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2008 , narrowly losing to perdue .	party officials have suggested that mccrory has n't fully disclosed his work .	mccrory has said repeatedly he has done no lobbying work , which would be unlawful without proper registration with the state .	mccrory campaign spokesman brian nick said wednesday that the former charlotte mayor has identified on the statement of economic interest the names of clients while working at the consulting firm where he works with his brother . "	that provides a full disclosure of any conflicts of interest he would have if elected governor , " nick said in a phone interview .	mccrory does n't have official clients at the moore & van allen law firm , where also works and receives a salary , according to his campaign and his disclosure statement .	mccrory told wway-tv in early february the demand by state democratic party officials was a " sad commentary on the desperation that they have " entering the election year . "	listen : i own a house , 2,600-square-foot house .	my wife and i own two used cars .	both over 10 years old .	they are paid for .	i have a 401 ( k ) , and i have no pension .	i own no other land , " mccrory told the station .	he added : " that 's it .	i 'm not independently wealthy . "	etheridge 's leading competitors in the may 8 democratic primary gave different responses .	lt. gov. walter dalton said last week he did n't believe releasing his tax return was necessary because the question was directed primarily at mccrory .	but campaign spokesman pearse edwards wrote later wednesday that dalton " intends to release tax returns for the past couple years as soon as we can pull the documents together . "	state rep. bill faison , d-orange , said " there has never been any question whether or not i have been a lobbyist " and wo n't release any tax records save for w-2 income statements associated with his legislative work . "	i do not plan to discuss my tax returns because my income is associated with small businesses .	some of which involve other people , " he said in a prepared release .	faison leads a durham law firm .	etheridge 's federal returns show he and his wife , faye , reported adjusted gross income of $ 232,433 in 2009 and $ 247,027 in 2010 .	the income was largely from his congressional salary , pensions or annuities and social security benefits .	the returns show the couple owed $ 40,881 in federal income taxes in 2009 and $ 45,082 in 2010 .	they also report losses on farm income and received proceeds from the federal tobacco quota buyout .	etheridge was previously a tobacco farmer .	the couple 's state returns showed they owed $ 8,868 in taxes in 2009 and $ 8,547 in 2010 .	in other candidate filing news : ?	attorney general roy cooper , a democrat , appears to have clear sailing for re-election to a fourth term after no one filed to run against him during the 2 ?	- week filing period . ?	former state sen. robert pittenger of mecklenburg county filed wednesday to run in the republican primary for the 9th congressional district , bringing to 11 the number of gop candidates seeking to succeed the retiring u.s. rep. sue myrick of charlotte . ?	state rep. grey mills , r-iredell , filed to run for lieutenant governor about 15 minutes before the filing deadline .	mills is one of five gop candidates seeking to succeed dalton . ?	forsyth county republican party chairman nathan tabor said he would ask the state board of elections to put him on the ballot as a candidate for a greensboro-area congressional district even though board director gary bartlett ruled he arrived to file after the noon deadline .	tabor , who wants to challenge u.s. rep. howard coble , said he arrived in the elections board building and was told he had made it on time .	tabor , however , was n't in the room when bartlett announced publicly the filing period had ended . ?	as many as 40 percent of the races for the 170 seats at the general assembly include candidates of one major party who will face no opposition from the other major party in the general election , according to the north carolina free enterprise foundation , which tracks legislative races .

fox lake police lt. charles joseph gliniewicz embezzled thousands of dollars from the fox lake police explorer program for seven years , and spent the money on such things as mortgage payments , travel expenses , gym memberships and adult websites , lake county major crimes task force commander george filenko said . "	we have determined this staged suicide was the end result of extensive criminal acts that gliniewicz had been committing in fact he was under increasing levels of personal stress from scrutiny of his management of the fox lake police explorer program , " filenko said .	the commander then endured blistering questions from skeptical journalists about his handling of the two-month investigation . "	we completely believed from day one that this was a homicide , " filenko said . "	gliniewicz committed the ultimate betrayal . "	just before he died , gliniewicz radioed that he was chasing three suspicious men in a swampy area near fox lake , a suburb north of chicago .	backup officers later found the army veteran 's body about 50 yards from his squad car .	his handgun was n't found for more than an hour , even though it was less than three feet from the body , filenko said .	gliniewicz 's death on sept. 1 set off a large manhunt , with hundreds of officers searching houses , cabins and even boats on area lakes .	helicopters with heat-sensing scanners and k-9 units scoured the area for days .	some 50 suburban chicago police departments and sheriff 's offices assisted , racking up more than $ 300,000 in overtime and other costs , according to an analysis that the daily herald newspaper published in early october .	more than 100 people submitted to dna tests as investigators sought matches to evidence collected at the crime scene -- genetic tests that filenko said ultimately found nothing .	asked wednesday whether that evidence will now be destroyed , filenko said he did n't know .	more than 100 investigators stayed on the case for weeks , even as questions arose and investigators began to concede that they could not rule out suicide or an accident .	one hint came when rudd announced that gliniewicz was killed by a " single devastating " shot to his chest , prompting an angry response from filenko , who said releasing such details put " the entire case at risk . "	but as the case progressed , investigators were uncovering incriminating emails that gliniewicz had sent , suggesting he felt his thefts were about to be exposed by an audit of the explorer program .	in a brief statement , village administrator anne marrin said the officer even threatened her personally after she began asking tough questions .	to the public , the case remained a homicide investigation , even after authorities announced in october that gliniewicz , 52 , had been shot with his own weapon .	authorities released only the vague description of three suspects that gliniewicz had radioed in -- two white men and a black man .	they tracked down three men captured on a home security video system , but all had rock solid alibis , filenko said , and no one was ever arrested .	gliniewicz was a 30-year police veteran and expert crime scene investigator , his boss said , and took elaborate steps to try to make it look like he died in a struggle , including shooting himself twice in the torso .	the lake county coroner , dr. thomas rudd , said his head was bruised in ways that may have been intentional .	he was struck by two rounds , one that hit his ballistic vest and another that pierced his upper chest .	gliniewicz was he was held up on national television as a hero who died doing his job in a dangerous environment .	an outpouring of grief swept fox lake , a village of 10,000 about 50 miles north of chicago .	the officer 's picture was hung in storefront windows and flags flew at half-staff in his honor .	others described him as tough when needed , but also as sweet and a role model to youngsters aspiring to go into law enforcement .	gliniewicz 's family had dismissed the suggestion of suicide .	the tattooed officer with a shaved head , who was married and had four children , " never once " thought of taking his own life , and was excited about his retirement plans , his son d.j. gliniewicz said .

the members of the national loved the movie " win win . "	in fact , the rockers loved it so much that when director tom mccarthy asked them to write music for it , they were a little worried their song might not live up to expectations . "	there 's that movie afterglow after you see a great movie , which we all had when ' win win ' was over , " said lead singer matt berninger in a recent interview . "	( but ) when you have someone who 's working on a film , what a huge creative mountain that is to climb .	to finish a feature film and then you just have this song that 's going to end their film .	... we were really , really nervous ... if it was going to work or not , " he said . "	win win " stars paul giamatti as mike flaherty , an attorney whose main clients are elderly folks living in his small new jersey town .	things change quickly for flaherty when his law firm is n't doing well and he decides to take guardianship of an aged client to earn extra cash .	he also takes in the client 's teenage grandson , a skilled wrestler , and an advantage for flaherty , who is also a high school wrestling coach . "	tom was able to paint an unbelievably realistic and honest portrait of normal people ?	showing their heroic sides and failures , " berninger said .	berninger said the band felt a buzz after seeing the movie .	the band 's goal was to write a song " that would sort of keep that buzz going or something . "	they came up with " think you can wait , " a mellow , yet intense piano groove highlighted by berninger 's baritone .	it was written by berninger and guitarist aaron dessner .	aaron 's brother bryce , and another set of brothers , scott and bryan devendorf , round out the band . "	we knew where people would experience the song ?	sitting in a theater .	we knew exactly how that was going to work ( and ) we thought of that a little . .	what kind of song will make the experience work well and not conflict or compete with the film ? "	berninger said .	the song was written while the band was on tour .	though it was the first time they had written specifically for a film , berninger said it was n't difficult .	the timing was perfect , he added , because the band is n't quite ready to create the follow-up to 2010 's " high violet . " "	none of us were ready to sort of dive in ( and ) we 're still not ready to dive in the process of thinking of a new record , " he said . "	so this was like a small exercise in writing . "	the movie , which earned glowing reviews at the sundance film festival , opened last week in new york and los angeles ; it opens nationwide in april .	the " win win " soundtrack was released digitally this week ; the cd and vinyl are out next month .	the band had been scheduled to perform in japan last week , but had to reschedule because of the earthquake and tsunami . "	we 've been following every moment and just praying that it does n't get much worse , " berninger said . "	we 've got a lot of friends over there .	everyone thankfully is fine . "

jim mortenson and his wife , mickey , are a typical couple .	they enjoy spending time with their grandchildren , purchasing or creating things for their home and gardening ... on their roof .	the mortensons have spent the last 30 years living in an underground house they built themselves over an eight-year span .	during the oil embargo in the 1970s , the mortensons and the rest of the country were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage .	then mortenson saw a magazine article that talked about underground living and the low cost of heating and cooling costs and they were intrigued . "	we told our families , and they did n't tell us we were crazy , " ?	he laughed . "	we were young and did n't know what we were doing . "	so the couple set out to build their house themselves .	it would take eight years and would still be in " rough " ?	shape when they finally moved in , according to mortenson . "	by then i?think the inspector just felt sorry for us so he let us move in , " ?	he said .	the house is constructed of concrete walls poured full of concrete and heavily waterproofed .	the outside has a facade of small rocks stacked to create a more organic look than the concrete blocks .	the home is shaded and rock paths , ferns and small water features surround the home 's front and back entrances and lead to the roof , which is stacked one to two feet deep in soil .	the couple has decorated the roof area with numerous tropic plants , such as banana trees and several types of elephant ears , which mortenson calls one of his favorite plants .	other than a few specialty items , the couple did the work themselves and experimented a lot to see what they liked and what worked for them .	the original floors were concrete that had been grooved and stained to look like tile , which was almost unheard of at the time .	those floors have been replaced with tile or hardwood now .	the kitchen floor is a series of old ladders that jim mortenson sourced from the phone company where he worked .	when they upgraded their systems to computers , the ladders became obsolete and the mortensons got the idea to use them as a unique and cheap flooring .	in fact , like the house itself , virtually every piece in the home has a story behind it , many of them relating to family members .	the model ships throughout the house were built by jim 's dad , the dining table and chairs , candleholders and many other metal items were constructed by their brother-in-law , who passed away . "	he started that table and chairs , and before he died , he taught me some of the stuff he knew .	i promised to finish it once he was gone , " ?	mortenson said .	that makes the iron table and chairs a precious keepsake , as is the blacksmith shop that mortenson inherited and relocated to his property .	as for the original reason for the building , the mortensons said it is easy and cheap to cool in the summer and usually the biggest issue is the high humidity .	for heat , the couple installed a furnace a few years ago but were careful to hide it to avoid destroying the view around the home .	the couple also has underground power and utility lines to keep the bamboo from interfering and to protect the " blending into nature " ?	view .	then , over 15 years ago , mortenson said he decided to start planting bamboo groves .	he had always loved and been fascinated by plants and bamboo , in particular .	from that sprung a business that now ships approximately 1,000 bamboo plants of all heights and varieties to places all over the country .	and this is n't the " lucky bamboo " ?	novelty item that grows in small water tubes and vases and can be purchased at many local stores .	mortenson cautions that these plants are not bamboo at all , but are instead a species called dracaena sanderiana .	his various bamboo types range from small , ground covering bamboo to towering giant bamboo , which is dug up and sold to be replanted in yards as shade , privacy screening or just for the appearance .	for more information on the house or the bamboo farm , visit www.jmbamboo.com or call (205) 283-5638 .

pratt & whitney expects military and commercial aerospace business will improve , but not for a while , the president of the jet engine manufacturer said wednesday .	david hess , president of the subsidiary of united technologies corp. , told reporters at the company 's annual media day that sales are expected to double , to $ 24 billion , by the end of the decade .

the farmers of rozajalalpur knew what was coming .	they saw others closer to india 's expanding capital city pushed off their land to make way for malls , apartments and offices .	they saw billboards rise along nearby potholed roads and tiny sales offices sprout in the grassy medians to hawk homes in leisure park , golf homes and dream valley .	then , in march , they saw the innocuous-looking announcement in the newspaper .	in type so small it was nearly unreadable , the state government declared it was seizing their farms under an 1894 national law enacted by british colonists to acquire land for roads and railways .	their land was being taken for the " public purpose " of " planned development . "	india 's transformation from a largely agrarian nation into a global economic power hinges on a steady supply of land for new factories , call centers , power plants and homes .	as cities like new delhi spill over their seams with ever more people , the government is increasingly seizing the farms around them for private development .	the farmers east of the capital are fighting back ferociously , taking to the streets and to the courts ?	with some success .	and the government is scrambling to appease them and prevent them from threatening india 's development dreams . "	we can not live without land , " said 23-year-old vivek nagar of rozajalalpur , a ramshackle village of muddy roads and 10,000 people about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) from delhi .	the land protests erupted in violence in may , killing four people , including two police officers , in the nearby village of battha parsaul .	similar protests have hit at least 17 of india 's 28 states over the past three years , according to the times of india newspaper .	in the spring , protesters fought to stall plans to take their land for a nuclear plant in jaitapur , in southern india ; in august three farmers were killed by police along a highway near mumbai as they protested a water project they feared would lead to land confiscations .	though nagar and his neighbors were offered a small fortune by their standards for their land , it was far below market value .	the money could n't compensate for the loss of the relatively secure , though tiny , source of income and food from their farms .	many feared they would end up like subhash nagar , a 35-year-old one-time farmer who lived off his small plot in a nearby village until the government took it in 2009 for 1.5 million rupees ( $ 30,500 ) and the promise of a job in the industrial area they said they would build .	he spent the money on his sister 's wedding and a new house .	but the " industrial area " turned out to be a residential complex , and he was left scrounging to feed his wife and two young children off loans from relatives and the 3,000 rupees ( $ 60 ) he makes a month at a tea stall , he said .	so thousands of area farmers took to the streets over the summer to fight the seizures that would turn their villages into the new development of noida extension .	rahul gandhi , the all-but-anointed next leader of the ruling congress party , rode out on the back of a motorcycle and joined the protest as a way to embarass the opposition-led government in the state of uttar pradesh .	the farmers turned to the courts as well , in a case seen as one of the most formidable challenges to the government land acquisition program .	they won a partial victory oct. 21 , when the high court ruled that residents of three villages should get their land back , and those from 61 others , including rozajalalpur , should get some more compensation .	the farmers said the extra money was negligible and plan to appeal to the supreme court .	the farmers say the uttar pradesh government barred them from selling directly to the builders on the pretense it would spur an uncontrollable building frenzy .	instead , it paid them 850 rupees a square meter ( $ 1.60 a square foot ) for their land and then sold it to builders for as much as 15 times more .	officials involved in the deals also pocketed money on the side , the farmers said , charging that the corruption spurs officials to take more and more land . "	bribery is happening on a large scale , " said rupesh verma , a lawyer for the farmers whose own farm was officially confiscated in 2007 , though his family has refused to leave it . "	all the players , the government , the politician , the bureaucrat , the builders are all getting some benefit .	only the farmers have been deprived . "	state officials say they are using the profits from the land sale to install roads , sewer and water lines and electricity hookups , justifying the higher price .	five officials from the embattled greater noida industrial development authority , which is in charge of the land seizures and development in the area , did not answer or return dozens of phone calls from the associated press .	the farmers point to the nearby state of haryana , where farmers made fortunes selling directly to builders , as proof their land is worth more than they are getting .	their fight has inspired others .	those who lost their land 35 years ago , when the satellite city of noida was first developed , are demanding extra compensation .	even those whose land in new delhi was seized by the british a century ago to build the parliament , the president 's house and the supreme court are suing .	hoping to head off further conflict , the congress party rushed a quickly-drawn bill to parliament to replace the 117-year-old land law with one that would make it far more difficult to seize land .	under the proposal , farmers would be paid four times the market rate for acquired land , and be given an annuity and a portion of the newly developed land .	the bill is an effort to end india 's long history of land disputes , which have displaced an estimated 50 to 60 million people since independence in 1947 , many for public works such as dams .	the seizures ?	and the confrontations ?	have grown more widespread with the economic liberalization that unleashed private development over the past two decades , said harsh mander , a member of the government 's national advisory council , which has proposed urgent reforms . "	when government starts acquiring land for private companies , using this colonial law , it 's something even the british never did .	then people got more and more angry , " he said .	disputes over land seizures forced the relocation of a planned auto factory from west bengal to the more business-friendly state of gujarat in 2008 .	land protests have also held up south korean steel giant posco 's plans to build a $ 12 billion plant in the eastern state of orissa , as well as reliance power 's efforts to build a 7,500 megawatt power plant outside delhi .	indian industry says the current system has needlessly politicized land acquisitions and increased anger at business . "	as far as possible , the private sector should be allowed to directly purchase the land from the owners , " said chetan bijesure , an official at the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry .	the new protests are leaving would-be homeowners like ravi garg out in the cold .	the 31-year-old software engineer was lured to the panscheel greens 1 residential complex by the promise of a swimming pool , gym and cafe .	for 2.4 million rupees ( $ 49,000 ) he could get a three-bedroom apartment in the noida extension development that would cost him 7 million ( $ 142,000 ) if it were in noida itself .	he paid a 1 million rupee ( $ 20,000 ) down payment and then saw his dreams crumble .	construction has stopped . "	everything was purely approved by all the government agencies , " he said . "	suddenly when construction reached the fourth or fifth floor , we were told that the land does not belong to the government .	it belongs to the farmers . "	he does n't blame the farmers , and they also sympathize with the homebuyers , whom they see as comrades fighting for a place to call home .	but the farmers bristle at the golf courses and the formula one racetrack ?	which hosted india 's first f1 race last month ?	as a sign the government is more interested in entertaining the super-rich than helping those on the edge . "	we are a poor country .	we need some necessities first .	after this , all these things can be done , " said verma , the farmers ' lawyer .	the farmers realize their way of life is ending .	dalchand sharma 's ancestor was a wealthy man with 50 acres in rozajalapur in the 1850s .	over the years , the farm has been divided between so many heirs that the 62-year-old sharma struggles to survive on just three acres .	his two sons , who would split that small plot , have chosen a different path .	one is studying for his mba and the other to become an engineer .	sharma wants significantly more compensation so he can buy a cheaper plot of land further from new delhi , as well as pass some money to the next generation . "	if the land is taken away , and my children get enough money to be comfortable and have houses , than it will be all right , " he said . "	if not , then i 'm happy the way things are . "

unearthed after more than 130 years from its resting place 6 feet beneath the surface , a baby 's headstone found at the city parking garage construction in downtown tyler this week led officials to a neighborhood history lesson .	self-proclaimed history buff and relic hunter rick garrett said the discovery by rodney kinard , foreman with l&l asphalt corp. , was amazing .	kinard was digging a week ago with a track hoe on the site of the new parking garage at elm street and broadway avenue and called garrett to tell him he found something he needed to see .	the foreman had unearthed a 2-month-old baby 's tombstone from 1883 , the tyler morning telegraph ( http://bit.ly/1hzcikj ) reported .	garrett , 57 , of tyler , knew he had to grab the tombstone and find the right people to take and preserve it .	he gently dusted it off in the back of his pickup truck tuesday . "	is that not the coolest thing , y' all ? "	he asked . "	this has n't seen daylight in years . "	it 's a baby 's tombstone .	i do n't know what to do with it .	it needs to be handled in a special way . "	he said they have found no other signs of any headstones or bones on the job site , just a few old bottles . "	we 're always careful when we excavate , " he said , adding that they ca n't slow down too much because they need to stay on schedule . "	in my opinion , ( the headstone ) needs to be preserved . "	it does n't need to be cast aside .	it needs some tender-loving care . "	garrett started rainbow sealcoat , an asphalt maintenance firm , in 1982 .	he merged his company with l&l asphalt a few years ago .	garrett said he is a history student and enjoys learning about tyler and smith county .	through the years , he has found a cache of civil war relics , and about 10 years ago , he and a friend found 22 tyler railroad baggage claim checks under the broadway underpass , a rare find .	the question city officials faced after last week 's discovery was if the headstone , dated oct. 30 , 1883 , was part of a grave site at the location , which could have slowed progress as they excavated for additional evidence .	the headstone displays the name of a 2-month-old child named william t. swinney , and smith county historical society 's sam kidd said records show the child was born to charles t. swinney and his wife , josie , who married in 1882 in smith county .	kidd said the parents listed their occupation as farmers in the 1890 census , and william , with his birth date in august 1883 , appeared to be the first born of seven children .	the records show the children went to the model school in smith county .	but how did the child 's headstone wind up buried under 6 feet of soil in downtown and not on a farm ?	kidd and tyler city engineer carter delleney believe the answer is simple - it was made at the location , which was a marble yard , according to maps from the 1880s .	the marble yard sat on the corner of elm and broadway where the parking garage is being constructed .	kidd said that since swinney was listed as a farmer , he believes the family might not have been able to afford to pay for the headstone , and the child was buried on the family farm somewhere in smith county .	the headstone was then just placed somewhere on the marble yard 's property , and over the years and various construction projects , it was buried .	kidd said records show the first presbyterian church , now on rusk street , was built on the site in 1919 , and montgomery ward was built on the college street side of the lot in the in 1930s .	the area also once held a horse barn and livery stable and a mechanic shop .	but it was not until construction crews moving vast amounts of dirt for the garage project that the headstone came to light .	delleney said research will continue to see if the headstone might one day be placed with the baby 's gravesite .	garrett said the swinneys were some of the founding fathers of east texas , and he hopes someone can trace the baby back to their family and put the headstone with their family plot . "	it 's a baby 's tombstone , " he said . "	it means a lot . "

"	a spine injury is such a devastating injury for a young person , " said dr. jeffrey r. sawyer , an assistant professor of orthopaedics with the campbell clinic at the university of tennessee , and a co-author on both papers .	the same goes for amputations , which , as a result of these types of injuries , have typically been of legs , toes and fingers .	the findings were to be presented wednesday at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons annual meeting , in new orleans . "	atv ( all-terrain vehicle ) injuries have been significant ; we 've been noticing increases for a while , " said dr. mike gittelman , an associate professor of clinical pediatrics in the division of emergency medicine at cincinnati children 's hospital .	gittelman , who was not involved with either study , said atv-associated fatalities increased nearly 60 percent between 2000 and 2005 , while non-fatal injuries rose 48 percent .	three-wheeled atvs have been banned ( although some do still exist ) , but four-wheeled , multi-rider atvs are gaining in popularity and it appears they are not necessarily any safer , the researchers said .	the first set of authors reviewed emergency-room records at a trauma center in california for all patients who had sustained injuries in an off-road vehicle from jan. 1 , 2005 through the end of 2007 .	there were about 110 patients in total .	people involved in an accident with a multi-rider atv were more than 10 times as likely to need an amputation as people involved in an accident with a conventional single-rider atv , the study found . "	it 's night and day .	if you get injured on one of these it 's going to be bad , " said study author dr. gregg wendell schellack , an orthopedic surgery resident at loma linda university medical center , who races motocross and dirt bikes .	the second study found that almost 4,500 u.s. children were injured in an atv-related accident in 2006 , with 7.4 percent sustaining a spine injury .	that represented at least a 140 percent increase in the overall number of children injured since 1997 and a 467 percent increase in spinal injuries .	seventy percent of these injuries occurred in children under the age of 16 .	spinal injuries were more common in older girls .	a third study found severe injuries among children who had participated in motocross , a sport involving off-road , two-wheeled motorcycles .	half of the children who had sought treatment for this type of injury at a single trauma center were hospitalized and nearly one-third needed surgery .	many had been wearing helmets and other protective gear .	the dramatic increase in the number of atv-related injuries could be due to any number of factors , including the number of vehicles on the road : in 1985 , there were about 400,000 atvs in the united states , said sawyer , while today there are an estimated 9.2 million .	there 's also the size and power of the vehicle to be considered .	in the 1970s , the typical atv weighed about 250 pounds and was 7 horsepower .	the newer vehicles weigh much more than that and can approach speeds of 100 mph , sawyer said .	they also have a higher center of gravity , making them more prone to roll over , schellack explained . "	if it starts to roll over , your first instinct is to put your foot down to try to stabilize or brace it , but that 's no match for a 1,000-pound vehicle . "	and children just should n't be riding these vehicles , added gittelman . "	they do n't possess the maturity or ability to operate these vehicles , " he said . "	if you 're not going to let a kid drive ( a car ) , why would you let them drive a vehicle that 's just as powerful ?

"	but they add that awareness and early treatment can keep young athletes from developing serious problems .	one expert scheduled to speak wednesday at the annual meeting of the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons in new orleans said injuries are increasing because kids are playing sports year-round -- often without seasonal breaks -- and being exposed to more athletic activity by playing on more than one team at once . "	this increased exposure means there will continue to be growing numbers of significant musculoskeletal injuries , both traumatic and chronic overuse , " said dr. thomas m. deberardino , an associate professor of orthopedics at the university of connecticut health center who specializes in sports medicine .	but awareness and prevention can make a difference , he said . "	even athletes at the college and pro levels have mandated downtimes .	we can not wait for kids to reach the college level to modify their training , because by that time it could be too late . "	in another presentation , dr. theodore j. ganley , director of sports medicine at the children 's hospital of philadelphia , warned that young gymnasts often develop osteochondritis dissecans injuries -- a softening of bone underneath cartilage .	but detection of warning signs can head off severe trouble , he said in a news release from the academy .	warning signs include persistent pain during activity , painful elbow swelling , locking of the elbow joint and loss of motion . "	early detection can allow for the option of non-operative treatments , such as activity modification followed by physical therapy , " ganley said . "	this can promote complete healing and rehabilitation allowing the young gymnast to fully return to his or her sport .

"	our findings are particularly exciting because the fda-approved drug chlorzoxazone , which has been used for more than 30 years as a muscle relaxant , can activate sk channels , " senior author dr. antonello bonci said in a ucsf news release . "	although sk channels are not the only target of this drug and it can present a variety of clinical side effects , it provides an unexpected and very exciting opportunity to design human clinical trials to examine whether chlorzoxazone , or other sk activators , reduce excessive or pathological alcohol drinking .

"	given the many adverse consequences of smoking , no one would suggest smoking in order to prevent parkinson 's disease , " study author dr. honglei chen , of the u.s. national institute of environmental health sciences , said in a news release from the american academy of neurology .	rather , he said , the results " could guide the development of studies on various tobacco components with animal models to help understand the relationship between smoking and parkinson 's disease . " "	research to reveal the underlying chemicals and mechanisms is warranted , " chen said . "	such studies may lead to a better understanding of the causes of parkinson 's disease . "	the study included 305,468 people , 50 to 71 years old , who provided information about their diet and lifestyle when they were enrolled and again 10 years later .	in that span , 1,662 ( about 0.5 percent ) of the participants developed parkinson 's disease .	compared with people who 'd never smoked , current smokers were 44 percent less likely to have developed parkinson 's , and former smokers were 22 percent less likely .	further analysis revealed that the length of time people smoked affected their risk .	those who 'd smoked for 40 years or more were 46 percent less likely to develop parkinson 's than those who 'd never smoked , and the risk was 35 percent less for after 30 to 39 years of smoking and 8 percent less for those who 'd smoked one to nine years .	the number of cigarettes a person smoked a day , however , did not affect the risk for developing parkinson 's disease , according to the study .	the study was published online march 10 in neurology .	on the web @ we move has more about parkinson 's disease at http://www.wemove.org/par/ .	copyright ( at ) 2010healthday .	all rights reserved .

in the 1990s italy made a mighty effort to shape up its hidebound economy and qualify for the euro .	then it slacked off ?	and now it is under pressure to make up for a lost decade 's worth of reforms to convince markets it can pay its debts .	the size of its huge debt pile , about 120 percent of annual economic output , is nothing new .	the problem is that because of the past two years of market turmoil in europe , investors are suddenly reconsidering countries ' abilities to repay their debt .	and as they take another look at italy , they do n't like what they see ?	dismally low growth that politicians have so far proved incapable of reviving .	the situation has become critical as investors lose faith in the eurozone 's third-largest economy and charge more to lend it money .	italy is too big to be bailed out like greece , ireland and portugal were .	a default on its ?	1.9 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) in debt would threaten the euro and the global financial system with collapse .	it did n't have to come to this .	unlike much smaller , bankrupt greece , italy has a big , modern and industrialized economy that can actually make things people abroad want to buy ?	think fiat , armani , benetton .	its budget deficit , this year at 4 percent of gdp , is below the eurozone average of 6 percent and it aims to balance government spending by 2013 .	but the country still has the world 's third-largest debt pile and the worry is that it is no longer productive enough to keep paying it off .	italy 's economy is hampered by high wage costs , low productivity , fat government payrolls , excessive taxes , choking bureaucracy , and an educational system that produces one of the lowest levels of college graduates among rich countries .	its economic output last year was 1.9 percent smaller than in 2005 , adjusted for inflation .	the international monetary fund projects anemic growth of 0.6 percent this year and 0.3 percent next year .	economist tito michele boeri , a leading expert on italy 's labor market at milan 's bocconi university , says the economy underperforms because its restrictive labor laws and sluggish educational system leave large groups of people , particularly the young , languishing without well paid jobs or training that would make them more productive . "	there is a serious problem with the way we use human capital in our country , " he said .	established workers with seniority enjoy strong protections against being laid off and get extensive severance if they do .	meanwhile , new entrants into the labor force face low wages and temporary contracts that mean they can easily be fired .	companies do little to train them , treating them as temporaries .	university education can take years longer than in other countries , with five years of study for a basic credential and several more for professional specialization .	lawyers in italy must do a two-year apprenticeship , and most firms get free labor out of the trainees , many of whom do n't even get expenses reimbursed .	the long education path is a deterrent that means only 20 percent of people between 25 and 34 have a university degree .	that leaves italy 34th of 37 industrialized countries surveyed by the organization for economic development and cooperation .	one italian in four under 30 is not in education , employment , or training .	the universities themselves contribute little to the economy .	no italian university made the times higher education list of the world 's top 200 , and while italy has prominent scientists and researchers many of them work abroad , where research grants and investment are easier to come by .	a whole list of trades and professions is protected , with entrance restricted and often based on connections : notaries , taxi drivers , pharmacists .	the system discourages competition and limits opportunity .	bureaucracy is legend .	italy ranks 87th on the world bank 's ease of doing business index , and 158th when it comes to getting a business contract dispute resolved ?	ahead of afghanistan but behind sudan , togo and kosovo .	it takes 1,210 days to get a decision in rome 's district court , compared to 518 days for the oecd average .	taxes take 68.5 percent of company profits , compared to an average of 42 percent among richer countries .	prospects for change are uncertain .	the fractious party system depends on coalitions , while prime minister silvio berlusconi is embroiled in criminal accusations he paid a minor for sex and appears barely able to get legislation passed .	berlusconi has lost markets ' confidence ?	stocks rallied temporarily on monday on a report that he intended to quit .	but italy does know how to change ?	when it has to .	in the early 1990s , italy 's outsized budget deficits meant it faced the possibility of being left out of the euro ?	a deeply humiliating prospect .	deficits were slashed .	the government confronted unions over cuts in pensions and won .	taxes went up .	government-owned companies were sold to reduce debt .	italy joined the euro as a charter member in 1999 .	but once it got into the euro club , the country was sheltered from market speculation by sharing a currency with stronger economies in northern europe .	markets were willing to loan to italy at just a few hundredths of a percent more than they did to financially solid germany , letting it carry its large debt pile with ease .	the pressure for reform eased .	the collapse of u.s. investment bank lehman brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis made investors look more closely at risk , but italy stayed out of trouble while weaker countries like greece , ireland and portugal lost access to affordable borrowing and needed bailouts .	the turning point came in july , when european union leaders decided that greek bondholders would not be repaid 100 cents on the euro .	that broke a fiercely held taboo that rich countries ' government debt was supposed to be risk free , sacrosanct . "	what happened was , investors looked and thought , if you can impose haircuts on greek government debt , maybe you can do it for italy as well , and maybe we should start pricing in some level of credit risk , " said jacob kierkegaard , a research fellow at the peter g. peterson institute for international economics in washington , dc .	as a result , investors started asking for more interest to lend to italy .	the yield on the country 's 10-year bond rose above 5 percent , then above 6 percent .	on tuesday , it hit 6.73 percent , the highest since the euro was created in 1999 .	italy was " essentially bailed out for a very long time by what i regard as a very deep and persistent market failure , " said kierkegaard . "	they managed to postpone the reforms they needed until the situation became acute and we 're in the pickle that we are in today . "	now berlusconi has a list of promised reforms , which economists say reads as if it were lifted from the 2011 oecd report on italy 's problems .	that report noted that most of its issues were the same as in the 2009 edition .	government have postponed change " because they tend to have a short-term horizon , they do n't see the benefits of reforms because those only materialize years later , " said bocconi university 's boeri .	meanwhile , the political costs of confronting unions and professional lobbies have to be faced today .	it 's a luxury italy does n't have any more .
boston gangster james " whitey " bulger is n't addressing the judge at his sentencing .	about a dozen relatives of murder victims spoke wednesday in federal court , but the hearing ended without bulger speaking .	prosecutors called him a sociopath and asked judge denise casper to sentence him to life in prison .	casper is expected to announce the sentence thursday .	bulger stared down at the defense table .	attorney j.w. carney jr. said he would not make a sentencing recommendation because bulger believed his trial was a sham .	bulger , now 84 , was convicted in august in a broad indictment that included racketeering charges in a string of murders in the 1970s and '80s , as well as extortion , money-laundering and weapons charges .	he became one of america 's most wanted fugitives after fleeing boston in 1994 .

a maricopa county superior court judge on thursday blocked a campaign finance violation case against arizona 's attorney general , saying it was improperly brought by the county attorney 's office .	judge john rea 's ruling leaves an uncertain road ahead for the case against attorney general tom horne and aide kathleen winn .	the two were accused of illegally coordinating outside campaign spending for horne during his 2010 campaign .	lawyers for horne and winn argued secretary of state ken bennett was required to send the case to horne 's office , not maricopa county attorney bill montgomery , who brought the civil case last year .	montgomery argued horne 's conflict of interest made it logical for the secretary of state to send him the case .	but rea ruled that while the conflict is clear , the law required the referral to horne first . "	the prosecutor was the judge and the jury , and he decided what the rules would be , " said michael kimerer , horne 's lawyer . "	and the judge said , ' you ca n't do that .	you have to follow the law . ' "	montgomery said he wo n't appeal and will move that his action be dismissed .	that sends the case back to bennett for referral back to horne .	bennett 's spokesman said they were reviewing the case . "	we will now get to see whether or not tom horne will continue trying to frustrate the full and fair determination of what occurred by seeing what he does in dealing with the obvious conflict , " montgomery told the associated press .	horne spokeswoman stephanie grisham said the attorney general was not commenting other than to say the ruling speaks for itself .	grisham said horne wo n't personally take action on the case . "	tom will remove himself the case , " she said . "	he knows it 's improper for him to be involved . "	the complaint from the secretary of state will be reviewed and sent to another outside agency , either the arizona solicitor general or perhaps another county attorney , grisham said .	regardless , she said it will not go back to montgomery . "	i think that would be highly inappropriate ?	he 's already made it clear he thinks they 're already guilty , " grisham said .	montgomery filed a civil action in october demanding horne 's 2010 campaign and business leaders for arizona return up to $ 513,000 in contributions .	he also said he planned to seek large civil fines .	candidates can not discuss strategy or other matters with so-called independent expenditure committees .	but there 's evidence that horne was involved in both raising money and deciding how to spend it on advertising by business leaders for arizona , montgomery said when he announced he was pursuing the case .	horne 's lawyer questioned the strength of the case against his client and said another prosecutor could see it differently . "	if it is referred out to another person , another prosecutor somewhere , they can make a different decision , " kimerer said . "	the evidence is really weak .	there 's no direct evidence , nothing but circumstantial evidence . "	horne , a lawyer who is the top-elected law enforcement official for the state , has denied any coordination .	horne defeated democrat felecia rotellini , a former prosecutor and bank regulator , by approximately 63,000 votes out of a total of 1.6 million ballots cast in the 2010 general election for attorney general .	she has announced she will run again in 2014 .	winn has denied that her group coordinated its fundraising or spending with horne .	she now works for horne .	horne also is facing a misdemeanor hit-and-run case that came to light as fbi agents trailed him while apparently investigating the campaign finance case .	the state bar , which oversees lawyer licensing , also is investigating horne over accusations stemming from the alleged campaign finance violations .
attorneys for a professor who is suing the university of illinois over a lost job offer have asked a federal judge to restore claims that evidence in the case was destroyed .	when u.s. district judge harry d. leinenweber on aug. 6 denied the university 's motion to dismiss steven salaita 's lawsuit , he also dismissed the evidence claim .	salaita 's attorneys argue in a motion filed tuesday that the university 's more recent release of emails in which then-chancellor phyllis wise used a personal account to discuss university business back their claim .	wise mentions in an email that she was deleting them after sending .	wise has since resigned .	university officials did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .	the university last year rescinded salaita 's job offer over a series of anti-israel twitter messages .

liquor producer brown-forman corp. and fort knox are mixing two kentucky traditions ?	bourbon and the military ?	at the famed army post .	soldiers and business executives planned to gather wednesday for the opening of the woodford reserve room , a place where soldiers can kick back and relax , perhaps while sipping whiskey crafted in the bluegrass state .	the room , featuring a granite bar and decorated with old bourbon barrels , carries the name of brown-forman 's woodford reserve brand , a high-end bourbon made about an hour and a half away at a distillery in central kentucky .	brown-forman executives call it the first-of-its-kind venture at a u.s. military installation and said it could start a trend if the fort knox opening is a hit .	perhaps a jack daniel 's room ?	named after the company 's top-selling whiskey ?	could someday be featured at another military installation .	but for now , the company wants to get it right at fort knox . "	this is just so new for us that we 're going to learn from it , " said joe bollinger , a brown-forman executive who oversees sales of the company 's products at military installations .	the louisville-based spirits company is hoping to win over new fans of woodford reserve by allowing the brand 's name to be attached to the room . "	we hope as troops come and go through fort knox , they 're going to take a piece of bourbon country back with them , " bollinger said .	col. bruce jenkins , the fort knox garrison commander , said it 's " the first and only branded bourbon room in the army , " and will provide a " unique gathering place " for soldiers , their family members , civilian employees and others . "	even though fort knox is an army installation , we really consider ourselves part of the community and the commonwealth , " he said .	the room , which comfortably accommodates 90 people , is part of the saber and quill club , a post facility that features a restaurant and areas that can be rented for events .	the opening featured woodford reserve and other brown-forman products , but after that fort knox will decide what 's served from the bar .	brown-forman is receiving a fee for the use of the woodford reserve name but wo n't disclose the amount .	the naming rights deal is part of a two-year contract with an option for another two years , the company said .	the company paid for the renovations to the room .	it plans to send master distiller chris morris to fort knox a couple of times a year to promote woodford reserve .	bollinger said the company also will preach the importance of moderation . "	we want to be pro-active , " he said . "	there 's a lot of stress right now in the military with all the deployments these troops have been through . "	fort knox , about 50 miles southwest of louisville , houses the army 's human resources command and the 3rd brigade combat team of the 1st infantry division .	it was previously home of the u.s. armor center , but after 70 years at fort knox , the armored divisions were moved to fort benning .
the first time katie crowder tried training at mesa martial-arts school kajukenbo arizona , the classes wiped her out . "	i have multiple sclerosis and i 'd just had a baby ... it was just too much , " she said .	but seven months later , the mesa resident was at it again . "	i called and said , ' if i come back , can i go at my own pace ?	if they do five sit-ups and i do one , is that ok ? ' "	she said . "	they told me to just come and do what i could . "	just under six years later , the 34-year-old crowder has a black belt and is an instructor at the martial-arts and conditioning gym .	she said her fatigue level is down , and the strength of her muscles , joints and cognitive abilities is up .	the mix of personalized instruction and a family-like feel is a key reason southeast valley residents say they 're drawn to smaller niche , or " boutique , " gyms , which have expanded to chandler , tempe , gilbert and mesa in recent years . "	the big gyms are fairly intimidating to people who are n't very knowledgeable about what they 're doing .	to walk into a place where you have 50,000 square feet of all this stuff that you do n't know what to do with , you can kind of get lost , " said joe marsit , a lecturer with a background in facilities management . "	one of our basic needs as people is to be fulfilled in a relationship , to have some social interaction .	a lot of times in big gyms , even though there 's a lot of people , you do n't get to know anybody , " marsit said . "	with boutique gyms , it 's the same people there , you get to know them , you kind of build a sense of family .	that keeps you dedicated to your program because you feel like you 're letting down people if you do n't show up . "	damien stone , owner of stonehard boxing gym in chandler , said even a competitive vibe can be made less threatening with the right staff .	about 40 people of all ages train at stonehard . "	we have pro boxers , amateur boxers , so we actually are a competitive gym , " he said . "	but people who are just looking for fitness should n't get scared .	i 've had people come in at 100 pounds overweight , women over 50 with chronic lower-back pain .	we start with fitness , and later , they 're able to step into the ring . "	experienced exercisers also can find value in new or unique programs .	orangetheory fitness , for instance , incorporates rowing machines and suspension training into its interval-driven workouts .	it has gyms in chandler , ahwatukee , gilbert and tempe and plans to expand . "	people want to do out-of-the-box things , " said jennifer huberty , an associate professor at arizona state university 's school of nutrition & health promotion .	huberty 's background relates to helping people change the way they think about physical activity , especially middle-age women and children . "	there 's enough research to show getting on an elliptical 45 minutes a day , yes , is good for your health , but you 're using the same muscles all the time , " huberty said . "	people are looking for other things to be a part of , so ( specialized gyms ) appeal to people in that sense , too . "	the benefits of boutique gyms typically do n't come free , though , despite many offering trial classes . "	they are definitely more pricey .	24 hour fitness is always going to have their deal ?	i think i pay $ 15 a month for a general-fitness membership , " huberty said . "	i pay $ 79 a month for a membership at my yoga place . "	costs can climb even higher if exercisers want to attend classes at more than one specialized gym to vary their workouts .	and they need to be cautious about who is providing the training to make sure they 're getting what they 're paying for , according to marsit . "	a lot of these small-boutique gyms , they 've created their own certification program that 's not necessarily a national certification , " he said . "	that does n't mean they 're going to hurt people , but it also does n't mean they know how to handle all populations .	you do have to be careful about the level of education and the quality of certification that somebody has . "	kelly corder , owner of kajukenbo , said he will decline potential customers whose attitude does n't mesh with the atmosphere the facility tries to create . "	we have people who are training to be fighters , law-enforcement types , all different types of people , but we have no egos , and there 's no one person looking over saying , ' i 'm the best , ' " he said . "	no matter who they are , everybody is high-fiving the other people and saying , ' good job , you did awesome , ' and that is pretty amazing . "	i do n't know any other environment where you see something like with an athlete and a beginner .	and for the person off the street , that means they do n't have to feel like they 're trying to compete with anybody . "	that vibe can be especially important for women , according to huberty . "	in my experience , something that 's smaller is probably going to feel more comfortable , especially for a woman who 's just starting to think about change , " she said . "	not to say every woman needs that , but ... you have to go with something you 're going to maintain . "	if a customer is lucky enough to hit on the right combination of expertise , customization and support , the higher price can be worth it , boutique-gym advocates agree .	beginner-turned-instructor crowder credits the gym ?	which operates locations in mesa and gilbert and has expanded to include a crosspit program , a version of crossfit that incorporates mixed martial arts and kickboxing ?	for allowing her to work at her own pace while providing strong peer and trainer support . "	i never think , ' ugh , i have to go to the gym , ' " she said . "	i always want to come back . "

at a small desk in a laramie basement , james vasek , 6 , is able to see beyond the seemingly useless pile of scrap wood sitting in front of him .	james knows exactly why the wood is atop his desk .	he put it there .	from the discarded wood , james creates airplane-like objects .	he glues , tapes and paints his planes nearly all on his own .	james made the planes to sell at heart to heart 's walk for life , an idea he hatched entirely himself .	heart to heart is a pregnancy resources clinic established in 1985 .	the organization offers services to laramie residents free of charge through donations from the community and events such as a benefit walk . "	after i heard that the heart to heart was coming up , i thought i 'd better start raising money , " james said . "	i kept asking my dad if we could build a model plane and we ended up not able to , so i just thought i 'd build my own that could n't fly . "	roni johnson , director of heart to heart , said james ' work took her by surprise . "	i was overwhelmed with how this little boy has so much in his heart to help others , " johnson said . "	it was unbelievable . "	james ' desk is home to a sprawl of materials , including paint , wood , paper towels , blue painter 's tape , two varieties of glue , pens , pencils and wheels .	while he sits building planes , his sister , addi , 4 , and brother , sam , 1 , often organize addi 's doll house .	the vasek family basement is an imagination-fueled asylum of sorts , where a young mind creates ideas such as airplanes crafted from scrapped hardware , glue and good heartedness . "	i thought it was very neat , " james ' father nate vasek said . "	this was his thing .	we had n't even said anything .	we told roni about it and she asked him if they could have one down there . "	james donated his first heart to heart plane free of charge .	he said price is dependent on the size of the plane .	while working on his second pre-ordered plane , james explained the process . "	this one would be $ 3 , but i already have $ 20 for it , " he said . "	we have $ 47 down so far .	sometimes i paint them first .	it depends .	this is the ninth one , i think . "	on the window behind james ' desk sits a gallery of his recent work .	on the right hand side is a large plane painted red with a handwritten " mom " emblazoned across the wings .	a pink aircraft sits at the opposite end , which addi claims as hers .	james ' first plane , featuring a multi-colored , striped paint job , sits in the middle . "	i just kind of do whatever i 'm feeling like , " said james . "	we actually make the wheels .	my dad helps . "	though james works almost daily on his creations , each plane takes about two days to finish .	the process is not labor intensive , but james must play the waiting game with his glue . "	the first one took me two days , " vasek said . "	some of them take me one and some of them take me two .	this one , today , will take me one . "	gluing his homemade wheels to the airplane body is james ' final step , but not without help from his father . "	he does n't allow me to glue it by myself , " james said . "	yeah , that 's because i know what happens with gorilla glue , " his father said . "	you 've done it , " james said . "	that 's what the paper towel is here for . "

nathaly uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit ?	something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of growing up as an illegal immigrant in the united states .	the high school senior said she hopes a federal program beginning wednesday and defers deportation for illegal immigrants will make it easier to get a decent job and help pay for college . "	this is my country .	it 's where my roots are , " said uribe , who moved from chile when she was a toddler and lives in glen burnie , md. " it feels great to know that the country that i call home finally accepted me . "	thousands of young illegal immigrants lined up wednesday hoping for the right to work legally in america without being deported .	the obama administration 's deferred action for childhood arrivals could expand the rights of more than 1 million young illegal immigrants by giving them work permits , though they would not obtain legal residency here or a path to citizenship .	at least 13,000 people stood in line in chicago , clutching reams of paperwork , for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates at the city 's navy pier .	hundreds of potential applicants waited outside nonprofit offices in los angeles for help filing paperwork to open the door to the staples of success in america ?	a work permit , and then later a social security number and driver 's license . "	it 's something i have been waiting for since i was two years old , " said bupendra ram , a 25-year-old communications graduate student in fullerton , calif. , who still needs supporting documents from his fiji islands home before he can apply . "	this offers us an opportunity to fulfill the dreams i 've had since i was a child . "	less than three months before an expected tight presidential election , the new immigration program is mired in controversy .	republican critics accuse president barack obama of drafting the plan to boost his political standing with latinos ahead of november 's vote and say the program favors illegal immigrants over unemployed american citizens during dismal economic times .	to be eligible , immigrants must prove they arrived in the united states before they turned 16 , are 30 or younger , have been living in the country at least five years and are in school or graduated or served in the military .	they can not have been convicted of certain crimes or otherwise pose a safety threat .	initial concerns by immigrant rights groups that federal authorities might take a tough approach on applications or that a republican presidential victory could unravel applicants ' gains have largely been pushed aside by massive interest from thousands of young people eager to work .	in los angeles , one immigrant rights ' group started hosting hourly information sessions over the last month to keep up with the frenzy .	the coalition for humane immigrant rights of los angeles has handed out 12,000 information packets about the program and is encouraging all eligible immigrants to apply as long as they have stayed out of legal trouble , said angelica salas , the organization 's director .	republican presidential candidate mitt romney does not support so-called dream act legislation for illegal immigrants who attend college ?	a key group that obama aims to reach with this program .	the former massachusetts governor has also criticized the deferred action program but has not said it he would reverse it , pledging instead an unspecified " civil but resolute " long-term fix to illegal immigration .	so far , the measure has won favor for obama along latinos ?	many who view immigration as a litmus test when choosing a political candidate , said manuel pastor , director of the university of southern california 's center for the study of immigrant integration . "	what this has done is to signal that the president , who was unable to get comprehensive immigration reform , does at least care about the situation of these immigrants , " pastor said . "	this is something that has been overwhelmingly popular in the immigrant population and in the latino population in general . "	some republican lawmakers have accused obama of sidestepping congress and creating a backdoor amnesty program with the high potential for fraud .	in an internal document outlining the program 's implementation , department of homeland security officials estimated more than 1 million people would apply in the first year and about 890,000 would be eligible .	on wednesday , immigrants lined up for help filing applications at workshops around the country .	others sought identity documents from consulates to be able to apply .	jaqueline cinto , 26 , said she 's still working on gathering the documents she needs , knowing it 's her only shot at putting her master 's degree in education to good use .	but she 's nervous that filing the papers might put her relatives at risk for deportation ?	even though homeland security officials have said they will generally not use applicants ' information to track down other family . "	i am even more afraid that i might be denied , " said cinto , who came to new york more than a decade ago from mexico .	in central california , one group has been warning farmworkers and their children not to sign up for the program at all . "	immigration agents could haul them off that same day , " said manuel cunha , president of the nisei farmers league . "	even if they do n't , if this policy is disbanded , now ice has the addresses of all the families .	why would you want to squeal on your parents ? "	the documents to prove identity could include passports , birth certificates , school transcripts , medical , financial and military records .	multiple sworn affidavits , signed under penalty of perjury , can also be used , homeland security officials said .	anyone found to have committed fraud will be referred to federal immigration agents , the department said .	laura lichter , a denver attorney who heads the american immigration lawyers association , said everyone takes a risk by applying . "	i would say that people are between a rock and a hard place .	in most cases , people can take ( the government ) at their word that their intent is to administer this policy in a fair and appropriate manner but there are going to be people that are going to find themselves having problems , " she said a decision on each application could take several months , and immigrants have been warned not to leave the country while their application is pending .	if they are allowed to stay in the united states and want to travel internationally , they will need to apply for permission to come back into the country , a request that would cost another $ 360 .	the lines on wednesday grew throughout the day ; the crowd in chicago was so large that workshop organizers told them to come back another day . "	navy pier is today 's ellis island , and while they saw new york city , today they see chicago , " said illinois congressman luis gutierrez . "	but the most important thing is they see america . "

the feelings of bitterness and hate could easily be a part of jacky martin 's daily life as he struggles with his paralysis and inability to breathe without a ventilator .	but the legendary jockey , who won close to 3,000 races in his career , now resting in his home just minutes from sunland park racetrack & casino , stays positive , clutching to the hope that his physical condition will improve and embracing the appreciation of what he has achieved so far in his life . "	i want to keep fighting as hard as i can ; that 's the athlete part of me , " a bed-ridden martin said softly .	the seven-time winner of the all american futurity quarter horse race in ruidoso was paralyzed sept. 2 at ruidoso downs race track and casino when the horse he was riding suffered a leg injury and fell to the ground along with martin .	it was just a few days before he was to ride ochoa , the eventual winner of the 2011 all american futurity .	it would have been all american win no. 8 for martin , who prior to the race felt he would be aboard a winner and was very much at peace in his life . "	i 've always competed and always tried to be the best i can , " martin said . "	i have to do that now with the injury .	i have to keep moving forward in life .	i always knew this type of injury could happen .	just like in racing , you have to deal with certain things , and i have to deal with this . "	ever since that fateful day , life has been a struggle for martin and his 53-year-old wife , tracey .	in addition to his paralysis , he 's battled weight loss and other severe physical ailments .	a recent surgery to help him breathe without a ventilator was unsuccessful . "	we just have to wait a little longer for things to improve , " his wife said . "	we still have faith .	it is hard , but we 'll keep looking for new things to help .	we 'll visit with some neurosurgeons and see what the next step is . "	tracey martin admits the past seven months have been difficult , but they have found a way to survive and , more importantly , they still have hope that life will improve .	martin is eating better and his weight is back up to 119 pounds after dropping to 100 .	and he 's still sharp and alert . "	there has been a lot of strain emotionally , physically and financially , " tracey martin said . "	there is always something that comes up that we have to deal with .	but jacky is determined and focused .	i 'm trying to find out anything and everything to help jacky get better . "	it 's not easy for either of us , but we support each other and that makes a big difference .	jacky is still jacky in a lot of ways .	he is a good man with a big heart and lots of pride .	i love him so much and i 'd do anything for him . "	that 's something that jacky martin knows . "	i could n't have made it through the past few months without tracey , " he said . "	she 's probably been away from me a total of five or six hours in the past few months .	she does so much for me and she has a lot of determination to get things done and help me .	our relationship means a lot to me .	we have a strong bond together . "	what also helps keep the martins motivated is the support and help they have received from friends and the horse-racing community .	sunland park racetrack & casino recently held an event to aid the martin family , and a benefit in oklahoma city raised $ 70,000 .	ruidoso downs race track and casino also has aided the family with its ruidoso downs race track chaplaincy benevolence fund , which has a longstanding mission of helping people in need . "	we 've gotten great support from lots of people who have been generous with their time , money and just stopping by to say hi or drop off groceries , " tracey martin said .	but just as important are the visits .	jack brooks , a former quarter-horse trainer and close friend , recently spent time with martin in oklahoma . "	if anyone can improve and get better , it 's jacky , " brooks said . "	it 's a tough deal for jacky , but he 's tough .	he was able to talk to me , and i was glad to see that .	jacky has a great heart and he 'll bounce back . "	errol rex meyers , a longtime trainer in louisiana , is a friend .	his father was paralyzed , so his support came easy as did his understanding of what martin is going through . "	jacky has taught me so much over the years and i just hope that i can help him , and hopefully i can teach him something , " meyers said . "	we 've had some talks about his situation .	i know jacky will stay positive in this situation .	i saw a spark in his eye , and he 's not ready to give up . "	jacky martin also got a nice piece of news recently .	he was inducted into the oklahoma horse racing hall of fame at remington park , where he raced during his longtime career . "	i 'm grateful for the recognition and that helped my spirits , " he said . "	i know there are those that care and still think of me , and that is part of what helps me get through this . "	jacky martin grew up in mansfield , ark. , near the oklahoma border and began his riding career in 1973 .	he 's a member of the ruidoso downs race horse hall of fame and he 's been a part of just about every big quarter-horse race there is , including a handful of wins in the prestigious west texas futurity at sunland park racetrack & casino .	overall , he has won a stunning 2,975 races and his horses have earned more than $ 45 million .	several of martin 's competitors over the years have marveled at his ability to be successful on such a consistent basis as well as his amazing knowledge of the sport .	he is one of the most respected jockeys , whose name is revered in quarter-horse racing circles .	martin has always known the risks and had suffered injuries before .	but he was never scared , instead being completely enamored of the competition race after race . "	i would n't trade my career for anything , " martin said . "	it 's unfortunate what happened , but it 's over now and life moves on . "	he had been challenged before .	martin found his way back to the top of the racing world in the summer of 2010 after missing four years of riding due to legal issues .	he battled back to regain his top form with the help of his wife , who also served as his agent .	that year he finished second in the all american futurity aboard jls mr bigtime and won other big races .	now , jacky martin is facing a whole new set of challenges as he tries to regain some normalcy in his life .	and just as in his riding career , he is using his fighting spirit to get back on top once again .	his wife still becomes emotional when she talks about her husband and best friend , but she stays positive .	she , too , is hopeful for the future and is always trying to find ways to help him improve .	for now , for the two , though , it 's one day at a time . "	we just have to move on , " she said . "	we still have faith .	we have each other , and that is what is most important . "

"	i 'm accepting the guilty plea , " she said .	authorities say dancy told pollard where to find the child that day , in the school library .	prosecutors had also said that dancy told pollard what the child was wearing , though dancy said she could only recall saying that some children who had done well on a test were allowed to wear blue jeans that day .	assistant u.s. attorney john dowdy said jesse pollard had been a coach at the school and that she and dancy were longtime friends .	ruffin , 26 , described as a possibly being a distant cousin of jesse pollard , admitted that she went to get the child , telling the librarian that she had stopped in the school office and talked to dancy about picking her up .	prosecutors said jesse pollard and ruffin drove the child to a hotel in bessemer , ala. .	pollard then bought a cellphone from a nearby wal-mart and used it to send a text to the child 's mother : " do n't call the police i will call you later if you call the police u wo n't see her again , " the indictment said .	ruffin wanted to go home at that point , so jesse pollard called her great niece , 21-year-old shaquayla johnigan , whose car broke down en route in boligee , ala. , dowdy said .	dowdy said devonta pollard when to get shaquayla johnigan , telling her that his mother " took " the child .	after meeting up with jesse pollard , shaquayla johnigan used jesse pollard 's rental car to take the girl to a hotel in laurel , miss. .	she sent a text message from the same phone to the child 's mother : " since you called police , i want $ 50,000 by 3 p.m. , i will tell you location later , " according to her guilty plea .	the next day , after a missing child alert had been issued , devonta pollard called shaquayla johnigan to say his mother " had gone to take a polygraph , " dowdy said .	shaquayla johnigan then called her father , 39-year-old james johnigan , who told her not to call police , according testimony .	james johnigan called his wife , 42-year-old joyce johnigan , and asked her to meet shaquayla johnigan in vossburg , miss. .	after meeting up , the two women dropped off the girl , unharmed , near a stranger 's mobile home in enterprise , miss. , telling the child that " her mom was in the trailer and to run up to it , " the indictment said .	shaquayla johnigan drove the car into a ditch and left it there , then later gave a gym bag containing the phone to james johnigan , who burned it , according to testimony .

across the vast pacific , the mighty bluefin tuna carried radioactive contamination that leaked from japan 's crippled nuclear plant to the shores of the united states 6,000 miles ( 9,650 kilometers ) away ?	the first time a huge migrating fish has been shown to carry radioactivity such a distance . "	we were frankly kind of startled , " said nicholas fisher , one of the researchers reporting the findings online monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .	the levels of radioactive cesium were 10 times higher than the amount measured in tuna off the california coast in previous years .	but even so , that 's still far below safe-to-eat limits set by the u.s. and japanese governments .	previously , smaller fish and plankton were found with elevated levels of radiation in japanese waters after a magnitude-9 earthquake in march 2011 triggered a tsunami that badly damaged the fukushima dai-ichi reactors .	but scientists did not expect the nuclear fallout to linger in huge fish that sail the world because such fish can metabolize and shed radioactive substances .	one of the largest and speediest fish , pacific bluefin tuna can grow to 10 feet ( 3 meters ) and weigh more than 1,000 pounds ( 450 kilograms ) .	they spawn off the japan coast and swim east at breakneck speed to school in waters off california and the tip of baja california , mexico .	five months after the fukushima disaster , fisher of stony brook university in new york and a team decided to test pacific bluefin that were caught off the coast of san diego .	to their surprise , tissue samples from all 15 tuna captured contained levels of two radioactive substances ?	ceisum-134 and cesium-137 ?	that were higher than in previous catches .	to rule out the possibility that the radiation was carried by ocean currents or deposited in the sea through the atmosphere , the team also analyzed yellowfin tuna , found in the eastern pacific , and bluefin that migrated to southern california before the nuclear crisis .	they found no trace of cesium-134 and only background levels of cesium-137 left over from nuclear weapons testing in the 1960s .	the results " are unequivocal .	fukushima was the source , " said ken buesseler of the woods hole oceanographic institution , who had no role in the research .	bluefin tuna absorbed radioactive cesium from swimming in contaminated waters and feeding on contaminated prey such as krill and squid , the scientists said .	as the predators made the journey east , they shed some of the radiation through metabolism and as they grew larger .	even so , they were n't able to completely flush out all the contamination from their system . "	that 's a big ocean .	to swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing , " fisher said .	pacific bluefin tuna are prized in japan where a thin slice of the tender red meat prepared as sushi can fetch $ 24 per piece at top tokyo restaurants .	japanese consume 80 percent of the world 's pacific and atlantic bluefin tuna .	the real test of how radioactivity affects tuna populations comes this summer when researchers planned to repeat the study with a larger number of samples .	bluefin tuna that journeyed last year were exposed to radiation for about a month .	the upcoming travelers have been swimming in radioactive waters for a longer period .	how this will affect concentrations of contamination remains to be seen .	now that scientists know that bluefin tuna can transport radiation , they also want to track the movements of other migratory species including sea turtles , sharks and seabirds .

flush with cash , florida legislators planned to end their annual session by approving a record state budget that increases money for everything from child welfare to schools to cleaning up water pollution .	the republican-controlled legislature is expected to vote on the budget shortly before it ends the 60-day session friday night .	the vote will close out a hectic final day that is expected to set the stage for a crucial election year when gov. rick scott and most legislators will be on the ballot .	in the final hours , legislators approved a measure that would allow the sale of a strain of low-thc marijuana for medical use .	they also voted to allow students living illegally in the country to qualify for in-state tuition rates for college .	both decisions were unthinkable in the past decade for many gop lawmakers .	scott is expected to sign both . "	it 's a great day for all of our students that want to live the american dream , " scott said shortly after the vote on the in-state tuition bill .	the legislature also passed a sweeping bill aimed at overhauling the child-welfare system .	the bill states that protecting a child from abuse is paramount and more important than keeping a family together .	that 's a significant shift for the department of children and families , which has placed a premium on putting fewer children in foster care .	lawmakers also voted for a bill that will allow the florida supreme court to grant law licenses to non-citizens .	and in a turnabout from last year , the legislature passed a bill that would allow professional sports teams to qualify for taxpayer money .	a similar bill died during the 2013 session .	legislators also approved an expansion of florida 's private-school voucher program for low-income children , largely along partisan lines .	they also agreed to compensate a former farmworker who spent 21 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing his seven children .	the bill changes a law that compensates wrongfully incarcerated prisoners so that james richardson can be paid more than $ 1 million .	but a big focus on the last day was the money .	the state 's economic recovery gave lawmakers the luxury of having a $ 1.2 billion budget surplus even after they had paid for school enrollment and other pressing needs such as growth in the state 's medicaid program .	most of that surplus was set aside for $ 500 million in tax and fee cuts , including a rollback in auto registration fees that was signed into law earlier this spring by scott .	the rest of the tax cuts included a three-day back-to-school sales tax holiday in august , as well as tax holidays for hurricane preparation supplies and energy-efficiency appliances .	senate president don gaetz , r-niceville , insisted that the legislature was not " awash in cash .

"	this has been a fiscally conservative year , but at the same time there are some needs in the state and we are trying to focus on them , " weatherford said .	but that did n't stop legislators from spreading millions to hometown projects ranging from $ 2 million to help build an observation tower in downtown miami to money to expand a gun range in brevard county .

gov. jerry brown on tuesday ordered $ 1 billion in midyear cuts to california 's budget that will result in pain for students who rely on school buses to get to class , mothers who depend on child care subsidies to keep working and support programs for the developmentally disabled .	brown , a democrat , said that the state 's revenues will fall about $ 2.2 billion below the $ 88.4 billion he and state lawmakers had hoped for when they passed the budget last summer .	the announcement was not surprising and could have been worse .	the state 's legislative analyst had predicted revenues would fall $ 3.7 billion below forecast .	still , the automatic midyear reductions sparked outcry from advocates and invited lawsuits from school districts .	the cuts include up to $ 100 million each to the university of california , california state university , developmental services and in-home support for seniors and the disabled .	community college fees would increase $ 10 per unit from $ 36 to $ 46 , and reductions would be made for child care assistance , library grants and prisons , among other programs .	school advocates warned that an estimated 1 million students ?	many of them with special needs or from low-income and rural areas ?	will be affected by the loss of home-to-school transportation funding .	in addition , school districts will lose another $ 79.6 million under the trigger cuts . "	the cut to transportation is absolutely devastating , " said steve henderson , a lobbyist for the california school employees association , which represents school bus drivers among other school workers . "	what that means is a lot of low income and rural kids will not have the ability to get to school . "	shortly after brown announced the cuts , which start taking effect jan. 1 , los angeles unified school board voted to sue the state over its $ 248 million cut to home-to-school transportation funding .	superintendent john deasy said at tuesday 's school board meeting the lawsuit will be filed wednesday .	he called the loss of busing funds " catastrophic " and warned it would leave 35,000 students all over the district and 13,000 special needs students without busing to school .	advocates estimated that cuts to schools amounts to $ 55 per student in california and could result in additional layoffs .	brown and democrats in the legislature had hoped for a $ 4 billion increase in tax revenue through the current fiscal year , which ends june 30 .	the budget they passed last summer without republican support was based on a combination of spending cuts , fee hikes and overly optimistic revenue projections .	the governor said that following through on the cuts is a demonstration of california 's fiscal discipline . "	this is not the way we 'd like to run california .	but we have to live within our means , " he said in a news conference at the state capitol .	the midyear reduction authorizes districts to cut the school year by up to seven days , but they likely wo n't have to cut more than half a day because the funding cuts were n't as severe as predicted , finance director ana matosantos said . "	he proved that there is an adult in the room when it comes to courage to pulling the trigger , " said kevin gordon , president of school innovations and advocacy , a sacramento education lobbying firm . "	but he found a way to spare schools from the ultimate damage that may have occurred if all the cuts had been implemented . "	patty siegel , executive director of the california child care resource & referral network , said thousands of working parents will be hit by a new round of child care cuts to save the state $ 23 million .	the state announced it would reduce 7,500 slots for child care assistance on top of 32,000 slots cut last summer . "	when you look at that against the 187,000 fully eligible children on the waiting list for child care , you have a perfect storm for unemployment , for return to welfare , and for a lack of opportunity for children to get the best start they need , " siegel said .	california currently faces a $ 3 billion shortfall and is expected to face a $ 10 billion deficit for 2012-13 , resulting in a $ 13 billion gap over the next 18 months .	earlier this year , gop lawmakers opposed brown 's proposal to place a question on taxes before voters without reforms to the public pension system , regulations and a spending cap .	having failed to broker a compromise with republicans , the governor said he felt it necessary to introduce his own tax initiative , which he hopes to bring before voters next november .	brown warned of further cuts when he releases his proposed 2012-13 budget in january unless voters support higher taxes .	brown said he wants to temporarily increase taxes on the rich , starting with individuals making more than $ 250,000 , and raise the statewide sales tax by half a cent , to 7.75 percent .	the proposal would raise about $ 7 billion a year for five years . "	going forward , in another three weeks , we will have a number of more cuts , far more than $ 1 billion , " brown said . "	and they 'll be the same kind of state services , very important to help the poor , elderly , our university students . "	he added , " we do n't have the money so we 've got to cut back . "	republicans accused the governor of using the mid-year cuts to his advantage as he pushes his tax proposal .	they said they are willing to work with the governor on a budget that protects education . "	republicans were ready to roll up our sleeves and hammer out a budget solution then , and we are still ready now , " said sen. bob huff , r-diamond bar , vice chair of the senate budget committee .

westlake 's police and fire departments got an early christmas present ?	a $ 115,000 grant from phillips 66 .	steve geiger , plant manager of phillips 66 's westlake refinery , said the money comes from the company 's community signature initiative , which aids communities with emergency preparedness and safety efforts .	the grant was awarded last friday .	mayor bob hardey tells the american press ( http://bit.ly/13revsn ) the money will be split between the two public safety departments .	the fire department will get $ 60,000 ; the police department will get $ 55,000 .	hardey said the money will enable police to buy and outfit a new patrol car , while fire chief jacques picou said his department will use the grant to buy a rescue bag system ?	air bags that can lift the weight of an 18-wheeler truck .	the police department is also getting a $ 25,000 grant from the calcasieu parish police jury to buy an additional police cruiser , which will also be outfitted with money from the phillips 66 grant .

"	with all of the traffic buildup and train waits , as with delays in response , we could be talking anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes waiting to try and rescue somebody . "
the union representing engineers and technical workers at spirit aerosystems has filed a challenge to the way employees are evaluated , claiming the company " concocted a scheme " to blame workers for management 's poor decisions .	the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace said thursday that it filed the complaint with the national labor relations board because the company did not negotiate before implementing a performance improvement process for employees whose evaluations drop .	union officials contend the company 's move violates contracts with 760 employees in its engineering unit and 2,270 workers in its technical and professional unit .	daniel hubbel , regional director for the nlrb , said an agent will be assigned to investigate the allegations .	if they are found to have merit , the nlrb would issue a formal complaint that would be heard before administrative law judge .	spirit aerosystems did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment left thursday by the associated press .	nearly 1,000 employees dropped in performance ratings without justification , speea midwest director bob brewer said .	employees who questioned their lower ratings were told the company is not performing well and the performance of its employees must correlate with the firm 's business performance , he said . "	rather than accept responsibility for their own poor decisions , management concocted a scheme to blame employees , " speea executive director ray goforth said in a news release . "	an excellent employee does n't suddenly become a struggling performer because spirit stock did n't go up . "	performance ratings are used to determine raises , promotions and terminate employees , the union said .	brewer said in a news release that problems appeared when employees started receiving their final ratings in november . "	without any notification to employees or the union , spirit changed the criteria and methodology managers used to determine employee performance , " brewer said .

some maryland lawmakers want to better protect bees from certain pesticides , but opponents testified tuesday that it 's unclear whether the pesticides are causing a drop in bee populations .	the pollinator protection act would require any plants , seeds or nursery stock treated with certain pesticides to include a warning label .	it also seeks to prevent people who are not experienced with using the pesticides , which are known as " neonics , " from using them .	supporters say the intent of the legislation is to diminish the widespread use of the pesticide to stop the decline of honeybees .

a federal judge in seattle on wednesday allowed a lawsuit over coal trains to proceed against bnsf railway .	seven environmental groups sued bnsf last summer , alleging it violated federal law by allowing coal dust , coal chunks and other pollutants to spill into protected waterways from open-top railcars .	u.s. district court judge john coughenour denied bnsf 's motion to dismiss the case .	the railroad company argued the groups did n't give sufficient notice and did n't have proper standing to sue .	trains currently carry coal from the rockies through spokane , seattle and along the columbia river gorge to an export terminal in british columbia .	more such trains are expected if proposed coal-export terminals are built .	two projects in washington ?	at cherry point north of bellingham and longview ?	and one near boardman , ore. , could bring millions of tons of coal by train through the state for export to asia .	the proposals are undergoing environmental reviews .	the environmental groups , including the sierra club , puget soundkeeper alliance and re sources for sustainable communities , say coal and coal dust fall off the railcars through holes in the railcars or when coal trains pass through rough tracks or are blown off during high winds or fast speeds .	they argue that bnsf violated the federal clean water act by discharging coal into local rivers without a permit .	the same groups filed a nearly identical lawsuit against bnsf in federal court in yakima .	in january , judge lonny suko also denied the railroad company 's motion to dismiss that suit .	that case is pending , but bnsf attorneys indicated in court documents that they planned to ask the federal court to consolidate both cases .	in court documents in the yakima case , bnsf has denied all claims .	it said that the allegations are unprecedented and noted that no permit under the clean water act has been issued or required by a regulator for the transport of coal by rail .	the environmental groups cheered wednesday 's news .	a message left wednesday with bnsf was n't immediately returned .

debt-ridden greece is on track with the reforms required as part of the rescue package that saved it from bankruptcy , a delegation from the international monetary fund , european central bank and the european commission said thursday .	the delegation was in athens to review progress in the austerity measures the government has been implementing in order to pull the country out of a financial crisis that brought it to the brink of default last month . "	the program is on track on all the dimensions , the main dimensions of the program , " the european commission 's servaas deroose said during a news conference in the greek capital , adding that progress had been made in the budget , structural reform and financial sector requirements .	the delegation said the deficit was lower than had been projected and the government was adhering to firm spending control . "	fiscal developments are positive with central government revenues coming in closely as expected and with firm expenditure control in the state budget , " the delegation said in a joint statement , adding that based on preliminary data to the end of may , " the state budget deficit was lower than was projected in the program . "	the team , which arrived in athens on monday and was leaving on thursday , is to return in late july for a full review of greece 's progress in the three-year euro110 billion ( $ 136 billion ) package of rescue loans from the imf and other eu countries that use the euro as their currency .	greece received the first installment of loans in may , just in time to prevent default and repay government bonds that were maturing .	it is to receive the next in september if the july review ?	the first formal review ?	shows it is still meeting its targets .	the team 's preliminary assessment " suggests that when we come back ... and undertake a comprehensive analysis , that we will find that program is on track , " said poul thomsen , the imf 's mission chief for greece .	to secure the funds , the center-left government has taken austerity measures that aim to make its bloated public sector less wasteful and its shrinking economy more competitive .	it has pledged to cut its massive budget deficit from 13.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 2.6 percent in 2014 .	the reforms , which include overhauling the pension system , raising retirement ages , cutting civil servants ' pay and raising consumer taxes , have met with a backlash from labor unions , who have staged a series of strikes and demonstrations .	a communist party-backed labor union has called for a protest rally thursday evening , a day after the government unveiled a draft presidential decree making it easier for companies to fire workers by raising the number of layoffs allowed and enabling lower compensation payments .	under the labor ministry 's proposed reforms , the number of workers that companies employing more than 150 people can fire will be increased to 5 percent of the work force per month from the current 2 percent .	smaller companies will be able to lay off a maximum of six workers .	the draft decree also slashes the notice period a company is required to give an employee being fired from the current 24 months to four months .	if workers are given full notice , employers will pay half the compensation required for sudden layoffs .	new figures released thursday showed unemployment hit a 10-year high in the january-march period , reaching 11.7 percent compared to 9.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .	a total 47,000 jobs were lost compared to a year earlier .	unemployment was highest in the 15-29 age group , where it reached 22.3 percent .	metro workers have also staged two 24-hour strikes on wednesday and thursday in support of about 285 colleagues whose contracts are expiring and face losing their jobs .	their union said they will also walk off the job on friday , leaving the capital without a subway system for the third day .	all public transport in athens ground to a halt for five hours thursday as bus , tram and trolley workers walked off the job to protest social security reforms , snarling traffic in the city center .	associated press writer nicholas paphitis in athens contributed to this report .
starting this fall , all north carolina elementary students would be required to learn cursive writing and multiplication tables if the state senate adopts a bill that passed the house unanimously thursday .	under the bill , public schools will have to provide instruction in both subjects in what its sponsor calls a return to basics .	state rep. pat hurley , r-randolph , said the issue came up after a class of fourth graders sent thank-you notes for a visit entirely in print .	she sent communications to every school district in the state asking if they require cursive instruction , and most of the 62 that responded said they leave it up to individual teachers .	that struck her as problematic , she said , because she considers cursive writing an essential skill for any adult , and her own research indicated it promotes discipline , motor-skill development and allows people to read important classic texts . "	today , with all the digital and the electronic ?	and i love digital and electronic ?	i feel like our students still need the other , " she said .	the department of public instruction reported the mandate could be easily integrated into the common curriculum and would require no new costs , she said .	hurley 's bill passed 107-0 after rep. mickey michaux , d-durham , interrupted her floor speech to ask whether she knows of anyone who actually oppose the measure .	the bill , which now goes to the senate , went for a vote shortly thereafter .
gov. mike beebe began the legislative session with a challenge to legislators who were floating dozens of tax cut proposals : show me what to cut in the budget to pay for it .	some republican lawmakers are all too happy to take him up on that offer .	from pay raises to state employees to boosts in funding for education , legislators from the gop say just about everything is on the table as they continue a push to contain state spending ?	and possibly make room for other forms of tax relief .	the roughly $ 475,000 that was saved from the state 's budget by removing raises for judges and prosecutors from the state 's first major appropriations bill was a mostly symbolic gesture as lawmakers begin tackling other parts of beebe 's $ 4.6 billion budget proposal .	the house is expected this week to approve the general appropriation bill , the bill that originally included the pay increases along with setting salaries for other elected officials in the state .	legislative leaders acknowledged the new political reality they face after the joint budget committee last week stripped the raises from the bill in response to objections from several lawmakers . "	i think it 's probably a healthy indicator that the membership is going to take a look at spending items in some detail .	certainly it was embraced by the voters , so folks want them to be responsible , " said house speaker robert moore , d-arkansas city . "	it 's our responsibility to spend the state 's money wisely . "	republican leaders in the legislature say the move offers a hint of what 's to come as they try to find ways to fund other tax cuts they 'd like to pass during this year 's session .	during his state of the state address earlier month , beebe told lawmakers to tell him where they would find money to pay for tax cuts other than his proposed half-cent grocery tax reduction . "	if you make a proposal that seeks to cut revenue or increase spending , the only responsible approach is to state precisely where that money is coming from , " beebe said .	legislative leaders say they 'll provide answers by looking at other spending bills as closely as they did the proposed general appropriation act . "	i think this gives us a glimpse into this legislature really trying to hold the line on spending , " said sen. gilbert baker , r-conway , co-chairman of the joint budget committee .	lawmakers , however , will have to pick their battles as they eye other spending increases to limit or scrap altogether in beebe 's budget proposal .	the second-term democratic governor has proposed increasing state spending by $ 109 million in the coming year , with more than half of that increase going toward the state 's public school system .	baker has already pointed to the next likely spending battle , raising the possibility of eliminating or limiting a 1.86 percent pay raise for state employees that beebe proposed in his budget .	the pay raises would cost an additional $ 23 million , and the argument baker and others have used against the raises for prosecutors and judges ?	that many workers in the private sector are n't getting raises ?	is likely to be repeated when looking at other state workers .	the move will face opposition from lawmakers who say that comparing the pay of prosecutors and judges with some lower-level state employees is n't fair . "	they 're paying the same taxes you 're paying and i 'm paying , " said state sen. jim luker , d-wynne . "	so are we going to make them pay twice and say they 're not entitled to any adjustment in their pay ? "	beebe 's office has also repeated his support of the raise , saying it 's a small cost-of-living increase that would go back into the economy .	the biggest question facing the legislature is whether the spending-cut fervor will include a boost in funding for public schools .	beebe 's budget includes a proposed $ 55 million increase in money for public schools , an increase that comes after a committee required to study school adequacy recommended an increase in the per-student funding .	the panel formed to recommend what constitutes an adequate education was formed as part of the state 's response to the long-running lake view school funding lawsuit that ended in 2007 .	rep. davy carter , who chairs the house revenue and taxation committee , said he 's been studying the lake view rulings to become familiar with the case and the changes that resulted from it .	carter said he 's not ready to call for a different amount for public schools in the coming year , but says he wants to understand better how the panel came up with its recommendation . "	i 'm not prepared to say i disagree with it , but i think it 's all of our responsibility to take a look at it and come up with our own conclusions , " said carter , r-cabot .	carter 's take signals a fight the gop may have within its own ranks over spending .	baker identified the boost in school funding to meet adequacy as an area he 's not considering when holding the line on state spending . "	we 've got a requirement to meet adequacy and that is an area i 'm definitely not looking at , " baker told reporters last week . "	i think everything else in my viewpoint is open for discussion . "

the european union will look thursday for a clear sign from prime minister vladimir putin that russia will adopt the economic reforms necessary to join the world trade organization this year , ending almost two decades of negotiations .	russia is the last major economy that is n't a member of the wto , the international free-trade body , and accession to it is crucial to a broader partnership agreement the european union wants to establish with russia .	officials from both russia and wto member states have said that 2011 is the year the country will finally sign up ?	after having started talks in 1993 . "	the only person who has n't said it yet is putin , " said anka schild , an adviser on international relations at the lobby group businesseurope .	at a meeting last fall , the eu and russia cleared up some of the main obstacles to russia 's wto membership .	they include russia 's high export duties on wood , which have pummeled nordic paper makers in recent years , and royalties airlines have to pay when they fly over siberia .	the united states also made similar progress bilaterally . "	now it needs to be multilateralized , " said schild , because all 153 wto members need to sign off on a newcomer .	one of the demands from foreign countries and companies is that russia start changing its trade laws and rules on intellectual property now , rather than after it has secured entry into the wto .	until then , businesses will remain skeptical of russian promises . "	we 've heard this story before , " schild said of russia 's request for quick entry to the wto .	but russia has some demands , as well , and putin comes to brussels with 12 of his cabinet ministers ?	including those in charge of foreign affairs , investment and energy ?	who will push their points of view in meetings with their counterparts in the eu 's executive commission . "	this will not be a meeting of the mutual admiration society , " said vladimir chizov , russia 's ambassador to the eu . "	i would n't exclude that on some issues , some discussions will not be very smooth . "	eu commission president jose manuel barroso will bring up the bloc 's concerns about human rights , the rule of law and democracy in russia when he meets with putin , a commission spokesman said wednesday .	at the heart of those concerns is russia 's reluctance to investigate the killings of several journalists and lawyers who had been critical of the government as well as its support for belarus , which the eu sees as the last authoritarian state on the continent .	the russian government , meanwhile , complains the eu is not protecting the rights of ethnic russians in the baltic states . "	the expectation of the eu is that as soon as a country joins it is immediately exempt from criticism .	unfortunately , double standards and biased approaches are quite often visible , " chizov said .	beyond politics , the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , accounting for about half of its foreign trade .	the 27-country bloc is also the biggest investor in the russian economy .	russia wants better access to the eu for its companies .	in the agricultural sector , for instance , only 14 russian companies are certified to do business in the eu , while about 4,000 european firms work in russia 's agricultural sector , chizov said .	central to russian fears about being squeezed out of the european market is its gas monopoly oao gazprom .	earlier this week , gazprom 's ceo , alexei miller , asked the eu to clarify rules in its new energy strategy , also known as the third energy package , which aims to separate gas production from pipeline management to prevent one company from controlling the entire supply chain in a country .	europe is russia 's most important market for gas , but russia has been concerned about the european union 's plans to diversify its sources of supplies .	many eu countries , including all baltic states , slovakia and finland , get all their gas from russia , which in the past has cut off supplies amid disputes over pricing .	slobodan lekic contributed to this report .

the case pitted the kentucky cabinet for health and family services against the nonprofit council on developmental disabilities .	the cabinet investigates when a disabled adult in state care is alleged to have been abused or to have died from abuse .	confidential records stemming from the probes may be disclosed under state law to certain individuals and groups , including social service agencies with legitimate interests in a case .	in her majority opinion , justice mary noble said the council -- despite its " laudable purpose " -- did not meet such a qualification to receive documents sought in its open-records request .	such documents are limited to agencies and providers who need information about the case to do their jobs , she said .	the council sought documents related to the death of a ward of the state who had been transferred to a residential setting .	the council broadened the 2010 records request to include documents related to the deaths of anyone who had similar transfers in recent years .	the cabinet denied the request for the records , and two lower courts sided with the cabinet when the council sued .	noble said the council 's interpretation of the state law restricting access to the records would open the documents to any watchdog group with a general interest in subjects investigated by the council .	such an interpretation " is so broad as to swallow the stated intent " of the law , she wrote . "	to read this exception to be a broad grant of access to any group that might simply want to know , for whatever reason , is simply to read this section of the statute out of context and to ignore the purpose and intent of the whole chapter , " she said . "	the phrase ' legitimate interest in the case ' means something narrower than a generalized interest in the type of case at issue . "	noble was joined in her opinion by chief justice john d. minton jr. and justices michelle keller and david allen barber .	justice lisabeth hughes abramson concurred in the result but wrote a separate opinion .	justice bill cunningham led the dissenters in the case .	he said the council had a legitimate reason for inspecting the requested records due to its watchdog and advocacy roles .	he said the council met the definition of a " social service agency " in the case .	justice daniel venters joined in the dissent . "	while these smaller group homes are viewed as more appropriate for individuals with disabilities , abuse and neglect are more likely to occur without notice simply because there are fewer people around to observe what occurs on a day-to-day basis , " cunningham said . "	for these reasons , the council has an interest in obtaining the requested records . "	noble said the state cabinet provides an annual report on all allegations of adult abuse , neglect or exploitation , along with actions taken in each case .	the report must be made available to community human services organizations .	the council is entitled to that report , she said .	she added it might be a better policy to require the cabinet to provide details of an investigation to any group that wants to know about it .	but the state general assembly has opted against such a broad policy , she said . "	it is not our role to define that confidentiality away simply because advocacy or watchdog groups serve a valid purpose , " noble said .
jpmorgan chase & co. , already beset by other costly legal woes , has agreed to pay $ 1.7 billion to settle criminal charges that the bank ignored obvious warning signs of bernard madoff 's massive ponzi scheme , federal authorities said tuesday .	the $ 1.7 billion represents the largest ever forfeiture by a u.s. bank and the largest department of justice penalty for a bank secrecy act violation , the government said .	the settlement includes a so-called deferred prosecution agreement that requires the bank to acknowledge failures in its protections against money laundering but also allows it to avoid criminal charges .	no individual executives were accused of wrongdoing .	the deal was announced by the office of u.s. attorney preet bharara , who scheduled an afternoon news conference to detail the agreement to resolve criminal charges : two felony violations of the bank secrecy act in connection with the bank 's relationship with bernard l. madoff investment securities , the private investment arm of madoff 's former business .	under the agreement , the criminal charges will be deferred for two years as jpmorgan admits to its conduct , pays the $ 1.7 billion to victims of madoff 's fraud and reforms its anti-money laundering policies , prosecutors said in a release .	a statement of facts included in the agreement describes internal communications at jpmorgan expressing concerns about how madoff was generating his purported returns .	it says executives were disturbed by the fact that madoff would n't let the bank examine his books . "	how much do we have in madoff at the moment ? "	a bank analyst wrote in a 2008 email . "	to be honest , the more i think about it , the more concerned i am . "	jpmorgan did n't immediately comment on the settlement .	it shares fell 55 cents to $ 58.45 in morning trading tuesday .	the deal was similar to one reached in late 2012 with the british bank hsbc , which agreed to pay $ 1.9 billion to settle claims it laundered money for iran , libya and mexico 's murderous drug cartels .	some observers called the hsbc settlement - which included a $ 1.25 billion forfeiture and $ 655 million in civil penalties - an example of the government stopping short of bringing criminal charges against a big bank or its executives because such prosecutions could be devastating enough to cause the institution to fail .	jpmorgan was madoff 's primary bank in the later years of a multi-decade fraud that ended in 2008 when he revealed to the fbi that his investment advisory business was a ponzi scheme .	account statements for thousands of clients showing $ 60 billion in assets were fiction .	of the roughly $ 17.5 billion in principal that was real , most of it was gone .	since then , a court-appointed trustee has recovered more than $ 9.5 billion to redistribute to burned clients .	the trustee sued jpmorgan for $ 6.4 billion in 2010 , accusing the bank of being " willfully blind " and " thoroughly complicit " in the fraud , but an appeals court found in 2012 that he had no legal standing to make the claim .	the jpmorgan settlement is the latest in a series of major deals it has made to resolve its legal troubles .	in november , the bank agreed to pay $ 13 billion over risky mortgage securities it sold before the financial crisis - the largest settlement to date between the justice department and a corporation .	jpmorgan still has several lawsuits pending against it related to the high-risk mortgage bonds that soured after the housing market collapsed in 2007 .	there 's also an ongoing criminal investigation led by the office of u.s. attorney benjamin wagner in sacramento , california .	the bank may be negotiating or litigating over the issue for years and has set aside $ 23 billion to cover those costs .	jpmorgan told regulators in a filing in october that it may need as much as $ 5.7 billion more .	madoff , 75 , pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison term .

research into market behavior and the psychology of decision-making could be awarded the nobel prize for economics on monday and improve the weak u.s. representation among this year 's nobel laureates .	betting agency ladbrokes says american behavioral economists richard thaler at the university of chicago and robert shiller of yale university are the top bets for this year 's award .	the 10 million swedish kronor ( $ 1.5 million ) prize is not among the original awards established by swedish industrialist alfred nobel in his 1895 will , but was created in 1968 by the swedish central bank in his memory .	thaler is considered a pioneer in behavioral finance , having studied the psychology of decision-making and the behavior of markets , and shiller is an influential economist who long predicted the u.s. housing bubble .	the economics prize ?	the last of this year 's nobel announcements ?	offers the u.s. a chance to boost its meager tally among the 2010 winners .	so far there is only one american laureate : richard heck who shared the nobel prize in chemistry with two japanese researchers .	since the economy prize was first awarded in 1969 , more than 40 americans have received it .	last year , americans elinor ostrom and oliver williamson won the prize for their work in economic governance , marking the first time ever a woman received the economics award .

"	research results have to lie some 20 years or so back in time because that 's about the amount of time needed to see whether it 's sustainable , " he said .	fromlet 's own top picks include american economist dale mortensen of northwestern university , whose research focuses on labor economics .	other names in this year 's speculation include american finance researcher eugene fama , french microeconomist jean tirole , and american macroeconomists robert barro and paul romer .	the science unit of thomson reuters listed political economics professor alberto alesina , economic professors kevin murphy , nohubiro kiyotaki at princeton and john moore as front-runners for this year 's award .	last week , british professor robert edwards was awarded the nobel prize in medicine for his fertility research that led to the first test tube baby .	russian-born scientists andre geim and konstantin novoselov won the physics prize for groundbreaking experiments with graphene , the strongest and thinnest material known to mankind .	the chemistry award went to heck and japanese researchers ei-ichi negishi and akira suzuki for designing techniques to bind together carbon atoms .	peruvian novelist mario vargas llosa won the literature prize and the imprisoned chinese democracy campaigner liu xiaobo was named the winner of the nobel peace prize .	the awards are always handed out on dec. 10 , the anniversary of nobel 's death in 1896 .

we believe the risk is immediate and urgent , " angela stubblefield , a federal aviation administration hazardous materials official , said at a public meeting on thursday .	she cited research showing the batteries can cause explosions and fires capable of destroying a plane .	billions of the lithium-ion batteries are used to power consumer electronics ranging from cellphones and laptops to power tools and toothbrushes .	tens of thousands of the batteries are often shipped on a single plane .	faa tests show that even a small number of overheating batteries emit gases that can cause explosions and fires that ca n't be prevented by current fire suppression systems .	thursday 's meeting was called to discuss what position the u.s. will take on the issue at an upcoming international aviation safety meeting .	the international civil aviation organization , a u.n. panel , is scheduled to take up the question of the safety of battery shipments at a meeting in montreal later this month .	icao issues global aviation safety standards , although it 's up to countries whether to adopt them .	the international federation of air line pilots ' associations has proposed that the panel adopt a ban until better packaging or other measures can be developed to reduce the risk .	earlier this year , aircraft makers including boeing and airbus called the battery shipments an " unacceptable risk . "	boeing and airbus also sent service bulletins to their airline customers warning of the risks revealed by faa 's tests .	as a result of the faa tests , more than a dozen airlines have stopped accepting any battery shipments , or large quantities of batteries shipped together .	icao also sent a bulletin to airlines this summer urging them to conduct safety assessments of their cargo operations to determine if they can safely handle battery shipments .	janet mclaughlin , another faa hazardous materials official , told the meeting that the u.s. position at the icao meeting will be that the ban should include all cargo shipments of the lithium batteries on passenger planes , not just bulk battery shipments .	the ban would n't apply to cargo airlines or to other kinds of batteries .	it also would n't apply to lithium-ion batteries that are packed inside equipment .	for example , a shipment of cellphones with lithium batteries inside them would still be allowed .	faa officials have said being inside a device lessens the risk that a short-circuiting battery will affect other batteries .	officials from the rechargeable battery and cargo airline industries spoke against a ban at the meeting .	passenger airlines are often paid by cargo airlines to carry shipments to destinations they do n't service .	a passenger airline ban would means some places around the world wo n't be able to receive battery shipments , industry officials said .	george kerchner , executive director of the rechargeable battery association , said some airlines have conducted the safety assessments and determined they can safely transport the batteries .	he said the faa should leave the question of whether to transport lithium batteries up to the airlines , which are better able to determine what they can do safely than the government .	airlines flying to and from the u.s. that accept lithium battery shipments carry 26 million passengers a year , stubblefield said .
the people of israel welcome the release of jonathan a. pollard , " netanyahu said in a statement . "	as someone who raised jonathan 's case for years with successive american presidents , i had long hoped this day would come , " he said .	pollard 's release from a federal prison in butner , north carolina came nearly 30 years to the day after his arrest for providing large amounts of classified u.s. government information to israel .	neither the u.s. justice department nor attorneys for pollard immediately responded to messages seeking confirmation of the 61-year-old 's newfound freedom .	pollard had been granted parole this summer from a life sentence imposed in 1987 .	his lawyers have said that they have secured a job and housing for him in the new york area , without elaborating .	the terms of his parole require him to remain in the united states for at least five years , though supporters -- including netanyahu and some members of congress -- are seeking permission for him to move to israel immediately .	the saga involving pollard for years divided public opinion in the united states and became both an irritant and a periodic bargaining chip between the united states and israel .	his release caps one of the most high-profile spy sagas in modern american history , a case that over the years sharply divided public opinion and became a diplomatic sticking point .	supporters have long maintained that he was punished excessively for actions taken on behalf of an american ally while critics , including government officials , derided him as a traitor who sold out his country . "	i do n't think there 's any doubt that the crime merited a life sentence , given the amount of damage that mr. pollard did to the united states government , " said joseph digenova , who prosecuted the case as u.s. attorney in washington , d.c. " i would have been perfectly pleased if he had spent the rest of his life in jail . "	seymour reich , a former president of b'nai brith international who visited pollard twice in prison , said that while he believed pollard broke the law and deserved to be punished , his sentence was overly harsh .	like other supporters , he believes pollard was " double-crossed " into thinking he 'd be afforded leniency in exchange for a guilty plea . "	i hope that he settles down and lives the remaining years as best as he can , " reich said .	pollard , a former navy intelligence analyst , was arrested on nov. 21 , 1985 , after trying unsuccessfully to gain asylum at the israeli embassy in washington .	he had earlier drawn the suspicion of a supervisor for handling large amounts of classified materials unrelated to his official duties .	u.s. officials have said pollard , over a series of months and for a salary , provided intelligence summaries and huge quantities of classified documents on the capabilities and programs of israel 's enemies .	he pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage and was given a life sentence a year later .	though he has said his guilty plea was coerced , he has also expressed regret , telling the associated press in a 1998 interview that he did not consider himself a hero .	good that came as a result of my actions , " he said at the time . "	i tried to serve two countries at the same time .	that does not work . "	under sentencing rules in place at the time of his crime , he became presumptively eligible for parole in november -- 30 years after his arrest .	the justice department agreed not to oppose parole at a july hearing that took into account his behavior in prison and likelihood to commit future crimes .	the parole decision was applauded in israel , which after initially claiming that he was part of a rogue operation , acknowledged him in the 1990s as an agent and granted him citizenship .	israelis have long campaigned for his freedom , and netanyahu said last summer that he had consistently raised the issue of his release with american officials .	pollard 's lawyers also have sought permission for him to travel immediately to israel , and two democratic members of congress -- eliot engel and jerrold nadler , both of new york -- have called on the justice department to grant the request so that pollard can live with his family and " resume his life there . "	the congressmen say pollard accepts that such a move may bar him from ever re-entering the united states .	the white house has said that it has no intention of altering the conditions of pollard 's parole , and even friends and supporters say they do n't know exactly what 's next for him .	president barack obama 's deputy national security adviser reiterated that stance on friday , telling reporters traveling with obama to malaysia that " this is something that prime minister netanyahu has regularly raised " in discussions with the united states . "	obviously , the one thing at issue is the requirement that he remains in the united states , " rhodes said . "	but again , the president does not have any plans to alter the terms of his parole . "	last year , the u.s. dangled the prospect of freeing pollard early as part of a package of incentives to keep israel at the negotiating table during talks with the palestinians .	but the talks fell apart , and pollard remained in prison .	more details about his plans were expected to emerge after his release . "	it 's a very unusual situation ... i 've been working with mr. pollard for 20 years , and even i do n't know where he is going or what he will be doing , " said farley weiss , an orthodox rabbi who has been lobbying on pollard 's behalf for two decades .	associated press writers ian deitch in jerusalem and david b. caruso in new york contributed to this report .

"	the most urgent issue on our apec agenda is advancing an aggressive and bold trade agenda , " donohue said .

"	pakistan is fully confident that the patriotic people of xinjiang autonomous region of the people 's republic of china and , in particular , kashgar as well as the chinese government , will succeed in frustrating evil designs of the terrorists , extremists and separatists , who constitute an evil force , " the statement said .	pakistan is one of china 's closest allies and it is unlikely the allegation will drive a wedge in relations between the countries .	on sunday , the " group of armed terrorists " stormed into a restaurant in the kashgar city center , killing the owner and a waiter and setting the restaurant on fire , the city government said .	the attackers then ran out of the restaurant and stabbed civilians indiscriminately , leaving another four people dead and 12 injured , it said .	police opened fire and shot dead four suspects at the scene , while another suspect died later in a hospital , it said .	xinjiang has been beset by ethnic conflict and a sometimes-violent separatist movement by uighurs , a largely muslim ethnic group that sees xinjiang as its homeland .	many uighurs say they have been marginalized as more majority han chinese move into the region .	the local government issued arrest warrants monday for two local ethnic uighurs who allegedly fled the scene and offered a 100,000 yuan ( $ 16,000 ) reward for information leading to their capture .	clashes in kashgar on saturday killed seven people and injured 22 .	a police official said two knife-wielding men hijacked a truck , rammed it into a crowd and got out attacking pedestrians .	people who came under attack retaliated , and one of the suspects was killed and the other caught , said the official from the xinjiang regional public security bureau .	the official said the attack was under investigation and the motive unclear .	she refused to give her name , as is common with chinese officials .	dilxat raxit , spokesman for the german-based world uyghur congress , which advocates nonviolence , said frustrations were forcing uighurs to take to the streets . "	uighurs have no peaceful way to oppose the chinese government , so some have taken to extreme measures .	it is unthinkable , but it is the reality , and beijing should take responsibility to deal with these issues , " he told the associated press from sweden , where he is based .	china defends its treatment of minorities , saying all ethnic groups are treated equally and that tens of billions of dollars in investment and aid have dramatically raised living standards .	police patrolled kashgar on monday , but locals said it was a sight to which they were accustomed .	a security presence is usually strong in xinjiang 's main cities . "	i took a bus to work as usual this morning and saw police armed with rods patrolling on streets , " said a woman at hua'an international travel service , who only gave her surname , zhao . "	seven or eight of them were in a group , but the police patrol the streets everyday .	i did n't see there was a big difference today . "	xinjiang is china 's central asian frontier , bordering pakistan , afghanistan , russia and other countries .	kashgar was an important hub on the ancient route through which chinese silk and other goods reached europe .
the push for expanding medicaid to add 70,000 more mainers gained marginal support thursday with senate approval of an amendment to cut off the state 's participation in the federal program after three years .	by a bipartisan 23-12 vote , the senate approved the amendment to the bill to expand medicaid , administered as mainecare in the state .	the legislation was sent to the house .	medicaid expansion under the national affordable care act is among the major issues awaiting resolution as maine lawmakers work toward a june 19 adjournment .	many states are grappling with the mandates of the new federal health care law .	maine republicans have been opposed to expanding mainecare , but assistant senate republican leader roger katz of augusta said thursday , " i think it 's time to act . "	the katz amendment would repeal the expansion dec. 31 , 2016 , but does not say what happens to the thousands covered by the expanded program when that happens .	during debate , sen. doug thomas , r-ripley , said getting people dependent on welfare only to " pull the rug out from under them " is wrong . "	this makes a terrible bill worse , " he said .	the amendment calls for federal confirmation that the state will receive a 100 percent compensation rate for childless adults covered under mainecare , including those covered as of december 2009 .	in addition , it calls for larger co-payments to discourage abuse of the program . "	is it what the democrats want ?	no .	is it what the republicans want ?	no .	is it what the independents want ?	i 'm sure not , " said senate majority leader seth goodall , d-richmond . "	it 's time to compromise .	it 's time to work together .	people 's lives are on the line . "	the new federal law requires the government to pay 100 percent of the cost for covering all newly eligible people for the first three years and then gradually lowers the payment to no less than 90 percent of the costs by 2020 .	maine republicans say the law still presents too many financial risks for a state that has grossly overspent what it can afford on social services .	the house earlier this week passed a version of the bill including language aimed at getting gop votes . "	we 're in financial trouble ... we 're in deep trouble financially , " said sen. james hamper , r-oxford . "	we can not afford this . "

at last check , all looks pretty good .	but with time , you may notice that flowers may start to look droopy .	the grass may begin to go brown .	but preventing -- and fixing -- those things may not be as hard as you think . "	one thing you really need to do is deadhead or cut off blooms when they are done blooming , " says royal oak , mich.-based advanced master gardener bridget mcelroy . "	if you deadhead , you will often get repeat blooms , " she says . "	i 'd rather look at no flowers and lots of nice leaves and stems following a deadheading than a bunch of dead blooms , " she adds . "	eventually the plant will produce more flowers . "	mcelroy cites delphinium and phlox as two plants that are sure to promise a second bloom within three to four weeks of deadheading . "	for those types of flowers , go down the stem and cut at the base of each bloom stem , " explains mcelroy .	mcelroy and other gardeners offer ways to keep your yard colorful and lush this summer .	give them support .	( at ) " early on , place plant supporters around plants that tend to grow tall and flop , " says mcelroy .	you can also use stakes with garden twine . "	there 's nothing worse than seeing daisies or delphinium , for example , blooming like crazy all over and people trying to put the plant supporters on at that point .	if you place them around the plant early , the plants will grow around and through them , and the structures will blend in with the plants . "	peony rings also work well .	mcelroy says you should also take notes now and note what might be needed next year .	fertilize .	( at ) " i fertilize in the ground once a month and fertilize in containers every two weeks , " says mcelroy , who likes miracle-gro . "	nutrients go right through containers , so feeding them needs to happen more often . "	water , water everywhere .	( at ) jennifer youngquest at english gardens suggests that lawns should get about 1 inch of water per week . "	ideally this should be applied in two separate applications , either by rainfall or supplemental watering , " youngquest says .	water early in the morning to reduce susceptibility to disease , and use a rain gauge to measure water .	flower and plant containers likely need a drink every day , says deborah bell , a bloomfield hills , mich.-based certified landscape designer . "	when it 's really hot -- like during a heat wave -- container gardens may need to be watered more than once a day , " says bell . "	if it 's not possible to water as frequently as you 'd like , water polymers can be added to your pots ' soil to help retain moisture . "	remember roots .	( at ) " always try to water at the base of the plants , and not all over the top of them , " says bell . "	it 's the roots that are in need of the water , and wet leaves may become damaged and more susceptible to disease , when left wet and sitting in the hot sun . "	shady deal .	( at ) " when there is excessive heat , move potted plants to the shade when possible , " bell says .	prune not when it 's hot .	( at ) " if you find it necessary to prune in extreme heat , try to do it sparingly , " bell says . "	plants are using their energy at this time to keep up with and survive the heat .	hacking away at it will just stress out the plant . "	master mulch .	( at ) using mulch is a great way to keep plant roots happy , says bell . "	mulch also cuts down on those unwanted weeds in your garden , too . "	mow high .	( at ) " a healthy lawn is the best defense against weeds , so mow high , keeping your lawn 3 1/2 -4 inches tall , " says melinda myers . "	mow often enough so you remove no more than one-third of the total height -- these clippings break down quickly adding organic matter , nutrients and moisture to the soil .	if this is not possible , mulch clippings . "	do n't over-rake grass .	( at ) " raking the lawn is really not needed , " says myers . "	if you have less than half-inch of thatch .	it 's good for the lawn . "	thatch cushions compaction , conserves moisture and eventually breaks down , adding organic matter to the soil .	get sharp .	( at ) be sure your mower blades are sharp , says myers . "	sharp blades make a clean cut that closes fast , so the lawn looks better and recovers faster and will be healthier as a result , plus you will use less gas . "

the national hurricane center says hurricane paula has weakened to a category 1 storm as it approaches western cuba .	the center said at 5 p.m. edt that paula had dropped a notch from a category 2 storm as it took a track forecast to pass very near or over western cuba later in the night or early thursday .	the center says the center of the hurricane is about 45 miles ( 70 kilometers ) west of the western tip of cuba and maximum sustained winds have dropped to 85 mph ( 140 kph ) .	it says a tropical storm warning has been issued by cuban authorities for that country 's capital , havana , and surrounding areas .	forecasters say paula is moving to the north-northeast at about 5 mph ( 7 kph ) and gradual weakening is expected over the coming day or two .	this is a breaking news update .	check back soon for further information .	ap 's earlier story is below .	havana , cuba ( ap ) ?	hurricane paula paused briefly on its soggy crawl toward western cuba and its lush tobacco fields wednesday afternoon , threatening to inundate an area still recovering from three major hurricanes in 2008 .	at 2 p.m. edt , the category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 kph ) was centered about 55 miles ( 95 kilometers ) west-southwest of cuba 's western tip , hours after brushing past mexico 's yucatan peninusla and the islands of cozumel and isla mujeres .	mexican authorities said american mickey goodwin , 54 , of corpus christi , texas , drowned tuesday while swimming off a cancun beach after he ignored warnings and red flags alerting to dangerous waters , the only fatality reported so far .	the u.s. national hurricane center said paula was stationary early wednesday afternoon and expected to begin heading north-northeast near 5 mph ( 7 kph ) later in the day , its small core forecast to be near or moving over western cuba late wednesday or early thursday .	forecasters said paula , despite some expected weakening , threatened a storm surge and anywhere between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall on parts of cuba .	the storm was small in area , with hurricane force winds extending just 15 miles ( 30 kilometers ) from its center .	cuba 's chief meteorologist , jose rubiera , said paula was expected to take a trajectory slightly north of previous projections . "	the hurricane 's intensity ought to diminish as it approaches cuba , which is obviously good news , " rubiera told his countrymen in a special broadcast on state-run television . "	this is an extremely small hurricane . "	in pinar del rio , many residents shuttered themselves indoors as heavy rain began falling .	veterinarian humberto rodriguez and his 13-year-old daughter , maria , made their way slowly in a horse and buggy down a highway near the town of los palacios , heading to their home in nearby consolacion del sur . "	i 'm evacuating my daughter from boarding school and we 're going home to prepare , " said rodriguez , 48 , as the girl rested her head on a pillow . "	i hope this one will not be as strong as the others . "	rubiera said there was still a chance cuba could be spared the brunt of paula 's force if it continued to drift north faster than anticipated .	nonetheless , cuban officials were taking no chances .	the communist government activated the island 's crack civil defense forces and urged residents in western pinar del rio province and on the isla de la juventud to cover up windows with plywood , tie down loose items and stay vigilant for flooding and heavy rains .	no evacuations were ordered .	pinar del rio was devastated by three hurricanes that hit the area and other parts of cuba in 2008 , doing about $ 10 billion in damage .	the area is known for its high-quality tobacco fields and is crucial for cuba 's famed cigar industry .	growers had planned to begin planting tobacco on tuesday ahead of next year 's harvest .	hurricane specialist robbie berg at the national hurricane center in miami noted that small hurricanes can be more unpredictable and the fact that paula slowed and paused for a time wednesday could actually raise the threat of heavy rainfall . "	small storms are a little more volatile .	they can strengthen more rapidly and weaken more rapidly so they are a little more unpredictable , " berg told the associated press . "	whenever a storm is moving slower it 's going to spend a longer time over any particular area , dumping heavy rain , " berg said . "	right now , western cuba is under the gun . "	berg said the middle and lower florida keys are under a tropical storm watch even though no u.s. landfall is forecast at this time .	as the storm left mexican territory wednesday , there were no immediate reports of major problems in cancun or other resort areas with an estimated 27,000 tourists in the october off-season . "	we can declare the coasts completely out of danger , " mexico 's quintana roo gov. felix gonzalez said as transportation links resumed there .	on tuesday , heavy rains and high winds destroyed 19 homes in northeastern honduras , that country 's emergency authorities said .
it 's a stunner : kate middleton arrived at her westminster abbey wedding in a splendid dress by sarah burton , creative director of the alexander mcqueen fashion house ?	ending months of speculation about the identity of the designer .	the lacy white gown , with its low neckline , dramatic veil and medium length train , immediately provoked swoons of admiration on friday .	jennie bond , a leading british monarchy expert and royal wedding consultant for the associated press , called it a " fairy tale . " "	it 's a dream , " she said . "	it is a beautiful laced soft look which is extremely elegant .	she looked stunning . "	as her " something borrowed , " middleton wore the cartier " halo " tiara , supplied by queen elizabeth ii .	the tiara was first purchased by the duke of york , later king george vi , for his duchess , who later became the queen mother elizabeth .	it was given to the current queen by her mother on the queen 's 18th birthday .	the " something new " in middleton 's ensemble were diamond earrings given to her by her parents .	the earrings by robinson pelham were a set of stylized oak leaves with a pear shaped diamond drop and diamond acorn suspended in the center .	but it was the dress that stole the show . "	oh it 's gorgeous ! "	gushed yvonne ryland , of yorkshire , england , who now lives in spain . "	it is absolutely beautiful .	it is so slimming and fits her perfectly . "	burton had earlier denied receiving the coveted commission , but that denial now appears to have been part of an elaborate strategy to maintain secrecy .	in recent weeks reports had circulated that parts of the mcqueen office had been cordoned off so no one could see what was being designed behind the screens , adding credence to the belief that burton had been chosen .	burton came to prominence when she was appointed creative director of alexander mcqueen shortly after the designer 's suicide in 2010 .	she had worked for him for many years , and has since earned plaudits for developing her own distinctive design style , which is slightly more restrained than the late mcqueen 's .	she has many supporters high up in the fashion world , including anna wintour , the influential editor of the american edition of vogue , who praised burton 's " brilliance " during a recent visit to london .	burton also got a private endorsement from alexandra shulman , the editor of the british vogue , who recommended burton to palace officials when they queried her about who would be the best choice to design middleton 's dress .	she has managed the sensitive task of taking over from one of the world 's most celebrated designers in the aftermath of his shocking death .	mcqueen had been suffering from depression and took his life days after the death of his mother .	unlike mcqueen , whose edgy personality was well known , burton has received little publicity outside the fashion press and she is not a well known figure on the london nightlife scene .	she edged out a number of other high profile british designers with experience in wedding gowns , including vivienne westwood ?	who has criticized middleton for being too timid ?	bruce oldfield , alice temperley and philippa lepley .	designers from outside britain apparently did not receive serious consideration in the wedding gown sweepstakes .	burton 's work caught middleton 's eye when she designed an off-the-shoulder wedding dress for sara buys , a fashion journalist who married tom parker bowles , the son of prince charles ' wife , camilla , duchess of cornwall , in 2005 .	the designer , who was raised in manchester in northern england , has dressed cate blanchett , lady gaga and gwyneth paltrow .	she joined mcqueen in 1996 as an intern , and in september presented her first womenswear collection in paris ?	clothes that were not as dark or dramatic as mcqueen 's , but still bold enough to make a very fashion-forward choice for a royal bride .

"	the winds and the thunderstorms are a concern , but on the plus side , we 're also looking at the possibility of some moisture by thursday , " frenzen said .	dry brush and grasses and moderate winds were fueling the blaze .	a so-called scoop plane , which flies low to scoop up water , and an air tanker were dropping water and retardant on the fire .	the fire started saturday .	the cause was under investigation .	further south , about 1,345 firefighters were working to control a fire that has burned across 35 square miles around satus pass and closed highway 97 between goldendale and toppenish .	the fire was 40 percent contained tuesday .	evacuation levels were lowered for residents of 69 homes on the fire 's sound end , allowing them to return home , said bruce livingston , a washington department of natural resources spokesman .	a containment line was established most of the way across the southern and western end of the fire , livingston said , and crews were focusing on the eastern edge of the blaze .	the blaze ignited last wednesday and the cause was under investigation .

in the past two years , high plains mental health has cut its staff by 20 percent , eliminated programs and cut staff benefits .	and it 's all because of a $ 1.2 million hole created by state funding cuts .	but the organization is n't going to put that funding burden on the 20 northwest kansas counties it serves .	instead , it 's raising user fees and asking those counties to pay their fair share of costs associated with services provided in each county . "	for the second time in 10 years , we 're increasing our base fees to keep up with the current medical charges , " hpmh executive director walt hill said . "	it 's unfortunate , but there 's just no other way for us to keep operating and continue to survive . "	high plains ' fees are based on income and assessed on a sliding scale .	hill said the agency previously saw 30 percent of its clients receiving a 96 percent or greater discount on services , which for a one-hour , $ 100 counseling session , would be $ 4 or less .	the increased fees still will be based on income but will require patients to be more invested in the services they receive . "	there 's no other way to generate revenues , " hill said . "	we have to turn to those who are receiving the services and ask them to pay a larger portion . "	hill presented his agency 's 2011 budget request to ellis county commissioners tuesday morning , asking for an additional $ 10,500 to bring the county to its appropriate funding level . "	our board has put together a six-factor formula that helps give counties a benchmark for what their funding might be , based on population , valuation and payroll in the county , " hill said .	in ellis county , that benchmark would be $ 236,840 .	last year , the county allocated $ 226,285 .	some counties , though , are n't nearly as close to their benchmarks , hill said .	cheyenne county provided funding in 2010 at 45 percent of its equitable funding level , while osborne and graham counties provided funding at approximately 65 percent .	however , some counties are providing more than their share of support for the agency , including gove county at 164 percent , rush county at 149 percent and russell county at 137 percent .	hill said he hoped the equitable funding model would provide counties with a better idea of the amount of high plains ' services that are being used in each community . "	it has been a real challenge , " hill said of finding a funding model that works for all parties involved .	an ap member exchange
when jenny holmes was an environmental studies major at the evergreen state college in the '80s it was possible , she says , to read almost everything published on theology and the environment .	she did and , while it fascinated her , there was n't enough source material to justify a senior thesis . "	i wrote about mercury levels in soil , " she says .	today , books and articles on environmental theology rain down on the interested and the uninterested alike .	the most avid reader ?	even holmes ?	has trouble keeping up .	people of faith who want to become environmental advocates are n't sure where to start .	but in oregon , for more than a decade , many of them have turned to holmes .	as director of the interfaith network for earth concerns , a project of ecumenical ministries of oregon , her network has helped more than 600 congregations from different faith traditions undertake many kinds of environmental ministry , from saving energy to restoring their own grounds and improving food security within their communities . "	she 's practical , approachable and willing to work with any group , " says the rev. wayne hill , retired pastor of oregon city united methodist church .	he met holmes 10 years ago as his 300-member congregation began to think about conserving energy within their building .	holmes helped arrange an energy audit and supported the congregation 's plan to use less energy .	hill was so impressed with holmes ' knowledge of ecology and theology that he helped her organize a global warming conference in 2000 . "	she 's very bright , but also very humble , " hill says . "	she knows environmental issues up one side and down the other and just what steps can be taken . "	holmes ' understanding of environmental ministry has its roots in her own experience .	she was born and raised in portland and grew up loving the outdoors . "	i bonded with the natural world at an early age , " she says .	camping , backpacking and riding horses were favorite activities .	her family lived for a while on the border of forest park in the west hills .	later , when her dad lost his engineering job , they moved to the cully neighborhood in northeast portland .	holmes , who lives now in the hollywood area , remembers delivering newspapers on her bike ?	in both neighborhoods .	she also spent time visiting relatives who had a cattle ranch near keating , in eastern oregon .	she saw firsthand how the values of the rich and poor , of urban and rural oregonians were alike and how they were different .	as an adult , she worked briefly for the u.s. forest service and ended up in washington , d.c. , the right place at the right time for a young environmentalist .	she volunteered at dayspring farm , a project of the church of the savior .	she attended the first north american conference on christianity and ecology and worked a booth on the national mall on the 20th anniversary of earth day .	she helped organize " green " bible studies and monthly forums on christianity and the environment .	and she enrolled at wesley theological seminary and graduated in 1993 , with a master 's degree in environmental ethics and public policy .	since she joined ecumenical ministries of oregon in 1998 , holmes , 50 , has helped develop an overall environmental program that addresses global warming , energy conservation , watersheds , biodiversity , land use and livability , food and wellness .	one of her heroes ?	wendell berry , the writer and farmer ?	says that how people eat determines how the world is used . "	our daily food choices have profound ethical dimensions for both people and the earth , " holmes says , adding that food issues are a good place for congregations to start environmental ministries . "	there are so many connections to make . "	holmes sees herself as a resource , ready and willing to offer ideas and introduce congregations to each other and to community partners .	that 's the whole point of the second annual earth care summit monday at congregation neveh shalom .	advocacy workshops , speakers and round table discussions will focus on a range of environmental topics , everything from community gardens to solar projects and sustainable buildings .	her knack for connecting people to each other , to issues and to ideas is one of her greatest strengths , says the rev. mark brocker , pastor of st. andrew lutheran church in beaverton and head of the steering committee of the interfaith network for earth concerns .	holmes has gathered widely different stake-holders for discussions of water rights and energy generated from coal .	brocker has seen holmes advise the st. andrew green team and organize advocacy days at the legislature in salem . "	she has a way of making sure everyone gets heard , everyone feels respected , " he says .	hill , the retired pastor who 's worked with holmes , agrees . "	jenny went to seminary for the moral training , " hill says . "	she was n't interested in being a pastor .	she wanted to be a change agent in this society .	and that 's where she has landed . "

( ap ) ?	when jenny christopher purchased the house at 1001 avery st. , also known as the kaltenecker house , in october 2012 , she learned she had many unanswered questions about its history .	christopher said while the house is on the national register of historic places , she has been unable to find anything about it before 1905 from deed records in the wood county courthouse .	she said the earliest owner she can find had the last name of masters .	she also found a map from 1890 that indicates the house was there .	the kaltenecker house was not owned by anyone from that family until 1974 , christopher said .	in the 1981 nomination form to place the house on the national historic register , it was noted the house " was built between 1860 and 1879 , and is a two-story , frame house in the eastlake-carpenter gothic style .	its roof has a complex composition of hips and gabled wall dormers , pierced by two brick chimney .	the house features sawn woodwork that make it the most highly ornamented residential building in downtown parkersburg . "	christopher said the house has a connection with a tragedy in parkersburg 's past , the 1909 quincy hill water tank disaster .	in march 1909 a water tank on the hill burst , destroyed the one next to it and sent 2 million gallons of water , mud and debris into the city streets . "	we have a picture taken in front of the house showing three bodies being loaded into a hearse , " she said . "	there were three fatalities .	two have been identified as mr. and mrs. wigal and for the third victim all i can find about her was she is listed as being an invalid , that could mean a host of things . "	christopher said she and dominique hickey are slowly restoring the house . "	when we moved in , it was in pretty rough shape , " she said . "	it 's on its way back , it will take some time . "	christopher said the plan is to use historically accurate dark colors for a different look .	she said the color scheme is three colors from a historic color collection , lincoln cottage black , cincinnati olivia hotel blue and white . "	it 's going to be a spooky , fun dollhouse , " she said . "	the outside is so crazy so we decided to roll with all the gingerbreading . "	along with being a private residence , christopher said one owner planned on making the house an ice cream parlor and one used it for an interior design business .	recently she spoke with a man who lived in the house in 1964 when it was a rental property . "	in the 1920s it was bought by a family named mehl , " she said . "	some friends of mine are distantly related to a mehl family and they are trying to get more information from them . "	christopher said owning the house has been a dream of hers for many years . "	i loved this house ever since i was small ; that 's why i got it , " she said . "	for 10 years i 've been waiting for this house and i 'm willing to talk to anybody who wants to talk about it because there are so many unanswered questions . "	because of the look of the house , she is surprised few people know anything about it .	however , she said she does know the one thing people have told her is not true . "	many people told me this is a sears roebuck or montgomery ward house , it 's a kit house that came off the railroad and put together her , " she said . "	that is not true because they did not start selling those until 1910 , plus they did n't build a house with this type of woodwork .	even a realtor told me it was a kit house . "	christopher said she has looked at old catalogs to see if they had houses similar to 1001 avery st. and there are none .	since 2012 they have been working on the inside of the house trying to get the rooms back in shape . "	i 've been told for many years there was no heating or cooling in this house and that 's why the walls are in bad shape , " she said . "	the chimneys were not fixed and water got in . "	it makes me sad , why did n't someone care about this place ?	look at it ?	how could you not care about it . "	christopher said the house looks larger than it is .	she said the house has two bathrooms , one on the first floor that was added in recent years , and one on the second .	she said the second floor bathroom , which is not usable at this time , has a claw foot bathtub .	there are also three bedrooms .	she found the attic ceiling and walls covered with newspapers from 1956 .	renovation is currently concentrated on painting the outside of the house .	christopher said they are also replacing decorative woodwork for insurance purposes .	christopher said she is happy to own a piece of parkersburg 's history and she is glad it was not demolished . "	i was told a long time ago the knights of columbus wanted this as a parking lot , " she said . "	can you imagine tearing down this house ?	it 's kind of an eyesore right now but by the end of the summer we hope to have all the painting finished and the wood repaired . "	christopher said anyone with information about the history of the house or lived in it can contact her by email at all-hallows-eve@hotmail.com .

groups supporting low-income mississippi residents said tuesday that elected officials are ignoring 300,000 people and refusing billions of federal dollars by choosing not to expand medicaid in one of the poorest states in the nation .	if the state were to extend medicaid , as allowed under the health overhaul that president barack obama signed into law , many low-wage workers could receive coverage that would enable them to afford doctors ' visits , prescriptions and medical supplies , said roy mitchell of the mississippi health advocacy program .	he said bus drivers , cashiers , day care workers and many others are in jobs that provide modest paychecks but no health insurance coverage . "	these are the people the governor is punishing today , " mitchell said during a news conference at the jackson medical mall , part of an effort to increase pressure on elected officials before the 2015 legislative session begins in january .	gov. phil bryant and other republican leaders have said repeatedly over the past two years that they do n't believe the federal government will fulfill its promises to pay most of the tab for medicaid expansion in the future , and they do n't want mississippi to get stuck with a health program that eats a disproportionately large share of the state budget . "	it 's relatively hard to get on medicaid , which it should be , " rep. john moore , r-brandon , a member of the joint legislative budget committee said during state budget hearings last week .	during the hearings , medicaid officials requested more than $ 1 billion for the first time in the program 's history .	legislators rarely grant agencies ' full requests for money , but even something just short of $ 1 billion would be a significant chunk of a state budget that 's expected to be just over $ 6 billion for the year that begins july 1 .	the federal health law allows states to expand medicaid to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level , or about $ 15,000 a year for one person .	in mississippi now , the income cutoff is about $ 5,500 for one person , and many able-bodied adults are not eligible for medicaid coverage regardless of how little they earn .	for now , and the next couple of years , the federal government will pay all expenses for people added under medicaid expansion .	after that , the law says the federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost .	bryant has said that rather than expanding medicaid , mississippi should put more money into community health centers that serve low-income patients .	robert pugh , director of the community health centers ' organization , the mississippi primary care association , endorsed medicaid expansion during the news conference tuesday . "	a sick child can not learn , and a sick adult can not earn , " pugh said .	about 40 percent of the patients are uninsured , and about 30 percent are on medicaid or another type of government-funded insurance , the state children 's health insurance program , pugh said .	follow emily wagster pettus on twitter : http://twitter.com/ewagsterpettus .

if music fans who attended friday night 's molly hatchet band concert enjoyed the smooth playing of guitarist bobby ingram , they 've got a sheridan-wyo-rodeo volunteer to thank .	after a unique guitar normally played by ingram was lost by an airline en route to billings , spurs volunteer joe campbell offered up his own guitar for ingram to play at the show .	ingram performed the concert using campbell 's gibson les paul guitar for all but one song of the band 's performance .	concert volunteer doug meier was notified of the situation friday afternoon by a phone call from molly hatchet 's tour manager informing him that the guitarist 's prized gibson les paul had been misplaced by the airline and would n't arrive in time to be used for the sheridan concert .	the tour manager then asked meier if he could try to locate the same model .

"	the guitar tech said if he likes it , he 'll play it , " campbell said . "	it has a distinct sound .	i bought it because guitar players i 've liked have always had them . "	when the molly hatchet band hit the stage , campbell was operating the spotlight that followed ingram .	campbell said he was pleased when he noticed that ingram was wielding his personal guitar . "	i was up there waiting for them to start , and i thought i could sort of see it , " campbell said . "	i was proud he played the whole show with it , so he did n't hate the way he sounded . "	meier praised campbell 's quick thinking as a symbol of the community effort that helps sheridan residents pull off a successful rodeo week .	he noted that campbell is a four-year volunteer whose background in live concert production has been appreciated . "	he 's been there every year for us , and his knowledge and experience are really an irreplaceable asset for the wyo-rodeo in putting on the concert , " meier said . "	sheridan never ceases to amaze me . "	campbell said that ingram was gracious and appreciative of the loaned guitar , which the band 's guitar tech restrung for him . "	it proved to me the problem is n't the guitar , it 's the playing , and someone can play that guitar , " campbell joked . "	it sounded really good . "
the suspect in the deaths of three muslim university students in north carolina had at least a dozen firearms in his home , according to search warrants released friday as world leaders condemned the shootings .	warrants filed in court listed an inventory of the weapons seized by police from the chapel hill condominium of craig stephen hicks , the 46-year-old charged with three counts of first-degree murder .	the warrants list four handguns recovered from the home hicks shared with his wife , in addition to a pistol the suspect had with him when he turned himself in to sheriff 's deputies about an hour after the shootings .	the warrants also list two shotguns and six rifles , including a military-style ar-15 carbine .	police also recovered numerous loaded magazines and cases of ammunition .	eight spent shell-casings were found in the neighboring apartment of deah shaddy barakat , 23 , and his wife , yusor mohammad abu-salha , 21 .	also killed was the wife 's sister , razan mohammad abu-salha , 19 .	relatives say all were shot in the head .	authorities have n't disclosed exactly how the victims died .

dwindling military budgets and the diminished threat of a nuclear war in europe dictate that the united states and russia abandon their cold war mentality and gradually remove some nuclear weapons from ready-to-launch status , according to a report wednesday .	the study by an international group of political , military and security experts questions the billions of dollars spent by the u.s. , russia and european nations on new nuclear-armed submarines and weapons when those countries are facing deep budget cuts and austerity measures .	citing the current political cooperation among the countries , the report recommends that they work together on missile defense , reduce tactical nuclear weapons in europe and develop a new strategy . "	outdated cold war-era security concepts and their associated weapons and military postures ( in particular , mutual assured destruction and nuclear forces on prompt-launch status ) , continue as if the berlin wall had never fallen , producing a dangerous asymmetry between military capabilities and true political partnership , " the report said .	the document , developed over the past year , makes 19 recommendations .	among the leaders of the group are former sen. sam nunn , a democrat , best known for his work with then-sen .	richard lugar , a republican , in 1991 in creating the program to help the former soviet states destroy and secure their weapons of mass destruction ; former british defense minister des browne ; former german deputy foreign minister wolfgang ischinger ; and former russian foreign minister igor ivanov .	in contrast to the saber-rattling from north korea , the report highlights improved relations among the u.s. , european nations and russia , which is unlikely to be propelled into a conventional or nuclear war .	against that backdrop , the group argues for the u.s. and russia to take the lead in systematically moving nuclear weapons off high-alert status , a template for france and britain to follow .	in an interview , nunn said the u.s.-russia relationship is one of both growing distrust and increasing mutual interest .	the former senate armed services committee chairman said issues such as missile defense and nuclear weapons need to be addressed as the world faces new challenges such as cybersecurity . "	we have to have a break out in thinking about how we 're going to deal with these issues in the future , " nunn said , underscoring the report 's call for a new dialogue on mutual security .	the report suggests that the u.s. and nato back a 50 percent reduction in u.s. tactical nuclear weapons based in europe , with russia adopting reciprocal steps .	the move would be phased in over time .	currently , the u.s. and russia have about 5,000 nuclear weapons each , either deployed or in reserve .	both countries are on track to reduce the deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 by 2018 , the number set in the new start treaty that the senate ratified in december 2010 .	the federation of american scientists estimates that russia has approximately 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads and the united states has 500 . "	a five-year target for completing consolidation of u.s. tactical nuclear weapons to the united states , combined with a process of mutual reductions with russia , could give a greater sense of direction and pace to nuclear risk reduction in europe , " the report said .	the report also calls for greater cooperation between the countries on missile defense , including sharing data and joint exercises .	the experts , including several former retired u.s. , russian and european generals , say that high-level talks involving leaders of the nations are imperative to establish a new strategy far from one that largely is on " cold war autopilot .

fetterman informed residents they could apply for a federal fund called the low-income heating energy assistance program , or liheap , which provides grants that average about $ 250 to cover heating bills from november to april .	with the help of peoples natural gas , he found so much success getting power restored for braddock customers that last winter , the north shore gas utility wanted to study how such a door-knocking campaign could be replicated .	customer outreach officials at peoples , which has 700,000 customers in 18 counties in western pennsylvania , encapsulated their partnership with fetterman in a formal policy paper and shared it with ceo morgan o'brien . "	it catches people who have fallen through the cracks , " fetterman said . "	having somebody go and check every address in the community .	it 's just good housekeeping . "	the success in braddock is remarkable because fetterman and peoples managed to achieve what has stumped state and federal officials .	despite the available resources , thousands of residential customers across the state -- and hundreds in the pittsburgh area -- who enter the winter with no heating service , according to a review of annual surveys by utility companies reported to the public utility commission .	the program , which opened for the season nov. 2 , is targeted for residents whose income falls at or under 150 percent of the federal poverty line .	this means an individual making up to $ 17,655 a year , or a family of four with an annual income of up to $ 36,375 , can qualify for assistance . "	these are the working poor , " fetterman said . "	these are not scofflaws with a $ 500 bill who were gaming the system ... these are people who just get behind , and once they 're behind they ca n't get out . "	more than 500,000 customers statewide receive assistance from liheap each year .	over the last 14 years , the number of households in pennsylvania each year that have had heating service terminated has averaged about 16,000 .	utilities reported an uptick in the last two winters , and last winter the number of disconnected customers jumped 38 percent to 23,213 statewide .	to kick off liheap season each year , utilities and state officials send out a slew of press releases and hold events to encourage people to apply .	duquesne light , like other utilities , includes liheap information in each customer 's november bill , in addition to calling and visiting the homes of customers who have applied for the program in the past , said spokeswoman ashlee yingling .	but peoples concluded traditional outreach efforts over the years appear to have had a minimal effect for a certain slice of low-income customers . "	a lot of times people are n't aware of the program , which is really amazing , " said rita urbaniak , manager of universal services at peoples .	the utility spends roughly $ 100,000 each year and partners with columbia gas of pennsylvania to advertise the program .	a campaign plan in its policy paper , peoples detailed how a local door-to-door campaign would work in any community .	most challenging initially could be finding a " local champion " : a devoted individual or organization that has knowledge of the community and a willingness to knock on doors . "	we can all easily identify the neighborhoods where we have customers with limited income , " urbaniak said . "	but you really impact those when you have a person who is in those communities , who knows where people congregate , who people trust with these problems . "	once a local source has been identified , the utility would dedicate a contact person in customer service to expedite the process of beginning liheap and restoring heating service .	in braddock , the utility worked around a customer privacy requirement in helping fetterman identify residents without heat : while it is barred from giving out customer names , it can legally give out customer addresses .	the utility suggested gathering residents at a " safe harbor " -- a place that " possesses a non-bureaucratic environment and thus an atmosphere that is not ' off-putting or threatening . ' "	in braddock , that was the free store , a donation redistribution store managed by fetterman 's wife , gisele fetterman .	peoples also partnered with fetterman 's nonprofit called braddock redux , which could receive and spend utility funds without restrictions that the utility might face .	for example , utilities are prevented from helping renting customers replace broken furnaces without landlord approval .	when some landlords in braddock were difficult to find , peoples funded fetterman 's charitable group to provide residents the necessary money to get a working furnace and receive liheap assistance .	a space heater for warmth mark berkley was one of those fetterman approached .	mr. berkley said he had fallen on " really bad times all the way across the board . "	using a space heater for warmth , he and his fiancee were effectively squatting in an abandoned house on comrie avenue last winter when the mayor knocked on the door .	through a series of events , fetterman was able to help transfer the deed to berkley from the owner who was n't interested in it .	then , the application process for liheap could start . "	essentially , it was one of these properties in braddock that everyone turns their back away from , " berkley said .	this winter , fetterman said , peoples is working with him to extend the aid program to rankin , a neighboring community where he has a good relationship with local officials .	after that , peoples plans to scale up the program in communities four or five times as large , said barry kukovich , manager of communications and community affairs .
milk will be off the menu in the new year at one of ohio 's big urban jails .	starting sunday , inmates at the summit county jail in akron will be offered a powdered breakfast drink instead .	jail administrator gary james tells the akron beacon journal ( http://bit.ly/t1c18n ) the milk alternative tastes like a vanilla milkshake .	the change is expected to save the county about $ 10,000 a year .	the jail in neighboring stark county cut back on milk more than three years ago .	other ohio jails have trimmed their budgets by cutting out inmate coffee or substituting less expensive foods .	fred wilson with the national sheriffs ' association says dropping milk is a good way for jails to be thrifty because money is wasted when milk spoils and must be thrown out .

last week , britain published a draft law that seeks to ensure that telecommunication companies " provide wider assistance to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies in the interests of national security .

"	we will productively work with the governments to try to convince them that 's also in their best interests in the national security sense , " he said .	cook said weakening encryption would be bad for online security , because " if you leave a back door in the software then there 's no such thing as a back door for the good guys only . " "	if there 's a back door anybody can come in , " he said .	british home secretary theresa may said last week that the draft investigatory powers bill " will not ban encryption or do anything to undermine the security of people 's data .

in a statement , the german company said it was setting aside around 6.5 billion euros ( $ 7.3 billion ) to cover the fallout from the scandal that is tarnishing vw 's reputation for probity and seriously undermining its share price .	there was no mention of any fines or penalties .	in the wake of its statement , vw 's share price was down another 17.6 percent at 110.20 euros and near a four-year low .	the fall comes on top of monday 's hefty 17 percent decline and means the company has lost an eye-watering 25 billion euros or so in just two days of frenzied trading .	the trigger to the company 's market woes was last friday 's revelation from the u.s. 's environmental protection agency that vw rigged nearly half a million cars to defeat u.s. smog tests .	the company then admitted that it intentionally installed software programmed to switch engines to a cleaner mode during official emissions testing .	the software then switches off again , enabling cars to drive more powerfully on the road while emitting as much as 40 times the legal pollution limit .	in its statement tuesday , volkswagen gave more details , admitting that " discrepancies " related to vehicles with type ea 189 engines and involved some 11 million vehicles worldwide . "	a noticeable deviation between bench test results and actual road use was established solely for this type of engine , " it said . "	volkswagen is working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures . "	to cover the necessary service measures and what it says are " other efforts to win back the trust of our customers , " vw said is setting aside some 6.5 billion euros in the current quarter .	that figure , it conceded , may be subject to revaluation in the light of ongoing investigations .	as a result , it said 2015 earnings targets will be adjusted but it did n't specify by how much .	it added that the software is also installed in other vehicles with diesel engines but that that for the " majority of these engines the software does not have any effect . "	volkswagen said that new vehicles with eu 6 diesel engines currently on sale in the european union comply with legal requirements and environmental standards .	ceo martin winterkorn issued an apology on sunday for the u.s. scandal , promised an internal investigation and acknowledged that his company had " broken the trust of our customers and the public . "	vw 's troubles already are not confined to the u.s. , though .	south korea said tuesday it would investigate emission levels of volkswagen diesel vehicles in the wake of the rigging scandal in the u.s. that has heaped pressure on winterkorn .	the german government is to also conduct new emissions tests in vw 's diesel cars , while france called for a wider europe-wide investigation into volkswagen 's practices -- and into those of french carmakers .	even before tuesday 's statement , a member of volkswagen 's supervisory board suggested that heads will roll in the wake of the scandal , though he said it was too soon to start assigning blame .	speaking on germany 's deutschlandfunk radio , olaf lies cautioned against " over-hasty calls for resignations . "	lies , who is also the economy minister of the german state of lower saxony , which holds a 20 percent stake in volkswagen , said he was sure there would be " personal consequences " once the investigation is complete .	the shockwaves from the scandal enveloping volkswagen were being felt far and wide across the sector as traders wondered who else may get embroiled .	germany 's daimler ag , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , was down 6 percent , while bmw ag fell 5.3 percent .	france 's renault sa was 5.5 percent lower .

utah gov. gary herbert and republican legislative leaders plan to meet with federal officials in washington on wednesday to hammer out a deal that limits the costs of expanding medicaid and earns support from conservative state lawmakers .	the group plans to speak with reporters wednesday afternoon following their meeting with u.s. health and human services secretary sylvia burwell .	herbert has said the group hopes to get more assurances and flexibility from the federal government as they look at how they 'll help more of the state 's poor get health insurance .	in addition to herbert , the group includes state senate president wayne niederhauser , r-sandy ; state house speaker greg hughes , r-draper ; sen. brian shiozawa , r-salt lake city ; and rep. jim dunnigan , r-taylorsville .	democrats have asked to be included in the group but said they can live with the arrangement if there 's public debate on the proposal later .	after state legislators failed to reach a deal earlier this year during their annual session , the group of five lawmakers and the governor pledged to find an agreement on expanding medicaid by july 31 .	after that , herbert would call lawmakers into a special session to consider the plan .	herbert , a republican , arranged a tentative plan last year with the federal government that would allow utah to use a chunk of federal money to enroll more of the poor in private health insurance plans .	the plan was an alternative to enrolling more people in the state-federal medicaid program .	it mirrors similar proposals from other republican governors pushing for a way to expand health coverage under president barack obama 's signature health care law while keeping it palatable to their right-leaning legislatures .	herbert proposed covering those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level , or about $ 33,500 for a family of four .	in exchange for making about 126,000 utah residents eligible for help over two years , the federal government had agreed to pay most of the program 's costs .	herbert 's office estimates the program will cost utah $ 25 million over the life of the two-year program .	the governor 's plan secured support from the state senate and the handful of democrats in the state house , but house republicans rejected the idea in march .	they said the federal money may not be there in the future , leaving utah on the hook for the entire cost of the program .

"	at the age of 20 , i had to plan a burial service on my own , not only for one important woman in my life , but two .	the hardest thing i ever had to do .	... my mother wo n't be there for my wedding , my first born . "	luciano said she had been forced to move from their home in johnston because she could not afford to maintain it .	she said she has gotten a full-time job and is taking parenting classes so that she can adopt her brothers , who currently are in foster care with other relatives .	rodriguez appeared to listen closely to the statement , but showed no emotion .	he was led away in handcuffs .

gov. rick scott has repeatedly pledged to slash government spending since his 2010 election .	yet more than $ 800,000 has been spent for substantial improvements to the greek revival mansion where he and his wife live .	taxpayers have footed the bill for things like the cleaning of oriental rugs and refinishing the oak flooring at " the people 's house .

parishioners of a 115-year-old roman catholic parish in holyoke on thursday began a 24-hour vigil to protest the springfield diocese 's decision to shut it down .	about 30 parishioners stayed after the final mass on thursday morning at mater dolorosa catholic church , according to victor anop , who was among the protesters .	he said some will stay as long as needed to get the information used to justify the closing .	the diocese did n't properly consult or share that information with parishioners ?	some of whom are related to the polish immigrants who started the parish ?	and they just want a chance to address the problems and save a parish that has so far " stood the ravages of time , " anop said . "	we all know that there are tough times in the world , as a whole , but i think that we deserve to have dialogue with our leadership , " anop said . "	the time for edicts is over in this world . "	in closing the parish , the diocese cited $ 750,000 in debt and a steeple in such bad shape it could make the building unsafe .	diocesan spokesman mark dupont says the challenges the parish faced because of its debt were well known , and parishioners were widely informed and consulted in various forums , including parish councils , from the pulpit by the church 's pastor and in the bulletin . "	it just does n't pass the smell test that people are claiming they had no knowledge of this , " he said .	the debt has accumulated just since 2000 , when the diocese forgave the parish 's previous debt , dupont said .	with the diocese already struggling financially , including being forced to make major layoffs last year , it could n't afford to forgive the debt again .	dupont says the protesters holding the vigil do n't represent the majority at the parish , which is scheduled to merge with the crosstown holy cross church starting this sunday . "	i think you 'll see a significant number of ( mater dolorosa ) families worshipping there ... not happy , some of them are sad at the loss of their church , but they understand the situation and they certainly understand that their faith transcends a building , " he said .	a similar vigil in adams has continued since december 2008 and a handful of boston area churches have been in vigil since 2004 to protest parish closings .

a fundamentalist christian couple who relied on prayer , not medicine , to cure their dying toddler son was convicted friday of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment .	herbert and catherine schaible of philadelphia face more than a decade in prison for the january 2009 pneumonia death of 2-year-old kent . "	we were careful to make sure we did n't have their religion on trial but were holding them responsible for their conduct , " jury foreman vince bertolini , 49 , told the associated press . "	at the least , they were guilty of gross negligence , and ( therefore ) of involuntary manslaughter . "	the schaibles , who have six other children , declined to comment as they left the courthouse to await sentencing feb. 2 .	experts say about a dozen u.s. children die in faith-healing cases each year .	an oregon couple were sentenced this year to 16 months in prison for negligent homicide in the death of their teenage son , who had an undiagnosed urinary blockage .	assistant district attorney joanne pescatore will ask the judge at sentencing to put the couple 's other children under a doctor 's care .	she was not yet sure if she would seek prison terms for the two felonies .	kent schaible 's symptoms had included coughing , congestion , crankiness and a loss of appetite , although his parents said he was eating and drinking until the last day , and they had thought he was getting better .	the lone defense witness , high-profile coroner cyril wecht , testified that a deadly bacterium could have killed him in hours .	herbert schaible , 42 , teaches at a school affiliated with their church , first century gospel church .	his wife , 41 , previously taught there , but now stays at home with the couple 's children , from an infant to teenagers .	the schaibles grew up in the church and have never received medical care themselves , not counting the help of the 84-year-old lay midwife who attends home births , according to pastor nelson a. clark .	clark , 69 , knew the couple as children and described them as honors students who dropped out of the church school in ninth grade , a year shy of the school 's 10th grade graduation .	catherine schaible did so at age 16 to begin teaching younger students , he said .	clark balks at suggestions the church is a cult or fringe religion .	church elders do not shun members who seek medical care , although they pray that they make a different choice next time , he said .	he notes the high number of deaths blamed each year on medical mistakes ?	as many as 100,000 a year in hospitals alone , according to a widely discussed institute of medicine study from 1999 . "	the legal community is trying to force our church group to put them in the hands of this flawed medical system , when they have chosen to put them in the hands of a perfect god , who does not make mistakes , " clark said friday .	the couple did not take the stand during the four-day trial , but a social worker testified that kent schaible once said " the devil won " in the battle for their son 's life .	pescatore argued thursday that adults can choose to forgo medical care for themselves but not for their children . "	if you want to be a martyr yourself and you do n't want to go to the doctor or the dentist or the eye doctor , that 's ( within ) your power .	we 're in america , " she said in closings . "	but you must take care of your children . "	about a dozen u.s. children die in faith-healing cases each year , a handful of which spawn criminal charges , according to shawn francis peters , a university of wisconsin lecturer who wrote a book about the phenomenon .	the schaibles deployed a defense strategy common in such cases : their lawyers said they did not know kent was near death .	defense lawyers also argued that the case was not about religion .	but bertolini , who works for an educational testing service , said there was no putting religion aside .	he said the deliberations were informed by several people of faith on the jury .	some states carve out exceptions to criminal neglect statutes for parents who rely on faith or spiritual healing .	but even in states that do n't , juries or judges often sympathize with them .	in a 2009 oregon trial with parallels to the schaible case , a jury acquitted the defendants of manslaughter in their 15-month-old 's pneumonia death , convicting the father , carl worthington , only of a misdemeanor .	but his in-laws , jeff and marci beagley , were the couple sentenced to prison this year in their 16-year-old son 's death . "	the fact is , too many children have died unnecessarily ?	a graveyard full , " judge steven maurer said at their march sentencing . "	this has to stop . "

the u.s. economy grew more slowly in the first three months of this year .	governments spent less , and businesses cut back on investment .	but consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a year .	the result suggests that the economy will continue to expand , slowly but steadily .	the commerce department said friday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the january-march quarter , compared with a 3 percent gain in the final quarter of 2011 .	in 2011 , the economy expanded just 1.7 percent .	but growth is expected to rebound to around 3 percent for all of 2012 as stronger job growth spurs more consumer spending .	the economy is by far the biggest issue in this year 's presidential campaign , with republican challenger mitt romney hammering at president barack obama 's record at handling the slow recovery .	consumer spending accelerated to an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter .	the strength came from a second robust quarter of growth in auto purchases .	consumer spending is closely watched since it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity .	all levels of government are under pressure as they struggle to control budget deficits .	government spending fell at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter .	and investment in equipment and software rose at just a 1.7 percent annual rate .	that was the slowest pace since the great recession ended in mid-2009 .	the 2.2 percent overall increase in the economy in the first quarter marked the 11th consecutive quarter that the gross domestic product has expanded since the deep 2007-2009 recession ended in june 2009 .	but the gains have been far below the usual increases coming out of a deep recession .	gdp is the nation 's total output of goods and services , from cars and refrigerators to electricity to manicures .	trade was a slight drag on growth in the first three months of the year .	u.s. manufacturers are finding it harder to sell products overseas because of europe 's debt crisis and weaker growth in asia .	many economists predict growth will strengthen in the second half of this year because they think hiring will continue to improve .	job growth has helped drive the unemployment rate to 8.2 percent in march from 9.1 percent in august and given households more money to spend .	joel naroff , chief economist at naroff economic advisors , thinks the economy will grow 3 percent for all of 2012 .	that would be nearly double the anemic 1.7 percent growth in 2011 .	the economy expanded 3 percent in 2010 , the first full year of the recovery after the great recession officially ended in june 2009 .	in 2009 , economic output had shrunk 3.5 percent .	last year began with signs of healthier growth .	but then the economy endured a series of shocks .	gasoline prices surged after political unrest triggered by the arab spring .	the earthquake and tsunami in japan slowed the flow of supplies to u.s. auto plants and other factories .	and the european debt crisis and a standoff over raising the federal borrowing limit unsettled investors .	gasoline prices have risen again this year .	but the effect on consumer spending so far has been less .	in part , that 's because a warm winter meant families did n't have to spend as much to heat their homes .	also , consumers this year have reduced their debt loads .	housing is inching back .	state and local governments are n't cutting as much .	banks are lending more .	and the threat from europe 's debt crisis has eased somewhat .	the government makes three estimates of the gdp for each quarter .	each revision is based on more complete economic data .
they have beards , ak47s and afghan pakul hats , but they are n't the taliban -- they 're tali-bots .	the marine corps conducted a demonstration of the autonomous robotic targets here june 16 , paving the way for what could become a new method of marksmanship training for u.s. forces .	the testing precedes the delivery of the marine corps ' first set of eight targets , scheduled to arrive in the fall .	those robots will belong to marine corps systems command , meaning only a handful of marines will get a chance to fire on them .	the robot , named rover , is produced by australia-based marathon robotics and is built on an armored segway platform .	it is capable of zooming in and out of doors at up to 8 mph and darting for cover when fired upon .	at nearly $ 2 million for the eight , they are n't cheap .	but they are a leap forward in training , according to marathon robotics representatives and marine officials . "	the target can move unpredictably in a way that no other target on the market can , " said alex brooks , who serves as marathon robotics ' chief executive officer .	in the simplest exercise , marines took out a single , slow-moving target .	however , some exercises had multiple " insurgents " quickly moving in different directions and threw a burqa-wearing " civilian " into the mix .	in most cases , the marines were able to avoid robo-civilian casualties , but on at least two occasions a marine manning the new infantry automatic rifle winged the burqa-clad bot while firing on full auto .	marines participating in the demo were students at the infantry weapons officer course , which produces gunners -- marines who specialize in the employment of all infantry weapons systems .	students were chosen because , as warrant officers and future gunners , " their opinions count more than others ' , " said lt. col. walt yates , who leads research and testing of marathon 's robotic targets .	he said the marine corps will give their input a great deal of weight .	the targets ' torsos drop backward and then reset each time they are hit , giving a clear indication that a bullet hit its mark , which is a plus for training , said chief warrant officer 4 saul cardenas , a gunner with 2nd battalion , 5th marines .	so when will grunts get to use them ?	officials declined to speculate when they might purchase robots for training .	they have said they would likely be used as advanced training tools for marines who are already expert marksmen . "	in the crawl-walk-run iteration , this is meant to take good shooters and make them better , " yates said .	special operations marines and the marine corps ' sniper school would be likely candidates to use the robots .

when elsa nethercot first stepped through the entrance of jesse smith 's colorado ranch last winter , she was n't sure what to expect .	self-confidence was n't her strong suit , and she was about to start five weeks of intensive classes in saddle making - a difficult , technical craft , requiring steady hands , patience and a willingness to fail .	it would be something both new and old for nethercot : old because she 'd tried her hand at saddle making more than two decades before ; new because the saddle-making class would ultimately become a very different type of therapy for her .	the astoria resident , three years retired from the u.s. coast guard , had been coping with depression and anxiety for years .	smith , a saddle maker and instructor by trade , had n't seen nethercot for more than 25 years , when he taught her at washington 's spokane falls community college .	she seemed different then , he remembers ?	a little more " interested in boys , " perhaps , than she was on crafting a saddle .	but when she came to his workshop , carrying herself with focused energy , she seemed driven to build something for herself and for her horse spirit , whose image she planned to imprint on the saddle 's leather .	nethercot 's focus came from the reason she was at the ranch in the first place : for her , designing and building a saddle would be a form of what 's known as " recreational therapy , " where activities and hobbies are used to keep people focused on positive thinking .	nethercot suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder .	but as she tells it : her ptsd did n't come from a bullet or an improvised explosive device , it came from sexual trauma .	while in the coast guard , she was sexually assaulted twice .	the first assault happened during boot camp .	afterward , nethercot said the alleged assailant turned and said , " you 're just a reservist .	you do n't matter anyway . "	she still remembers the words and the impact they had on her .	she left community college in 1983 , a quarter short of graduating , to join the coast guard full time . "	i ended up putting my saddle-making dreams on hold , " nethercot says .	what followed was a 20-plus-year career full of ups and downs - a period when she found herself shrinking from a world in which she felt she did n't belong .	she developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with the harassment and assaults that left her with low self-esteem .	in 2004 , nethercot said she was assaulted again while on leave from the coast guard .	the attack left her feeling numb .	at the time , her superiors tried to help , but said there was little they could do . "	when i finally retired in 2007 , i started thinking about saddle making again , " nethercot says .	through the process of building a saddle , she discovered a therapeutic outlet that helped her gain self-confidence and a sense of acceptance .	her work reached a point of culmination in late october , when nethercot 's saddle took home a gold medal in the applied art mixed-media category at the national veterans creative arts festival in fayetteville , ark. .	the event is sponsored by the u.s. department of veterans affairs .	smith was impressed by nethercot 's work , and her desire to learn .	an air force veteran himself , he became aware of nethercot 's past while mentoring her .	semi-retired , smith takes one student at a time .	over the years , many of those students have been veterans who have suffered from military trauma . "	it 's hard to explain how to do it , " he says . "	but it 's a really important thing , if you can help people with their mental attitude and be an influence . "	smith says he 's not surprised his protege won first place .	her work was nice and clean .	the leather carving was careful and precise .	she practiced it three to four times a day " to work the bugs out , " he says , and that takes dedication .	the craft consumed her in a way he did n't remember when he was teaching her in spokane . "	mentally , she just she came in more ready to concentrate on what she was doing , " smith said .	nethercot never felt accepted by veterans from other branches of military service .	but that changed when she attended the national veterans creative arts festival to pick up her prize .	traveling across the country to show off her artwork ?	one of only 100 veterans from around the nation invited to display their artwork , and the only one from the coast guard ?	forced her out of her comfort zone . "	being in the coast guard , you always feel like you 're on the outside looking in when it comes to being a veteran , " nethercot says . "	a lot of vets do n't consider the coast guard a military service , and we are .	so i just always felt like i never belonged , like i did n't earn it and i did n't matter . "	so when it was time to take the stage and explain what led her to make her piece of art , nethercot shared her story .	apprehensive at first , she explained every detail .	and then it happened : she started crying ?	not uncommon , she says , but this was in front of 300 fellow retired service members who attended .	they showed an outpouring of support for her .	veterans from different branches and different wars approached and embraced her .	they called her their sister .	they said she belonged and mattered .	they hugged her .	and though her ptsd typically prohibits that sort of physical display , she embraced them back .	for the first time in a long while , nethercot felt proud to be representing the coast guard , an organization that she continues to love , and receiving the support and acceptance of hundreds of fellow veterans . "	to travel and be with all these veterans ?	- and we 're all so creative ?	was the most amazing , amazing experience of my life , " nethercot says . "	it was absolutely unreal . "	nethercot is n't alone with her ptsd .	psychological studies indicate that women serving in the military are more predisposed to developing the disorder than men , even though they 're barred from serving in combat .	one 2006 study published in military medicine showed that 71 percent of female veterans seeking va benefits cited that they suffered from ptsd because of some form of sexual assault .	candis sollars , an astoria social worker who specializes in assisting veterans , says there 's been a change in recent years , with more veterans coming forward asking for help . "	before recently , ptsd was all very hush-hush , " sollars said , adding that she 's seen an increase in ptsd cases recently . "	now , there is n't as much stigma to come forward . "	she cautions that recreational therapy is n't a cure-all , however .	nonetheless , she 's seen it have a beneficial impact on her patients .	vince morrison , an astoria-based clinical social worker , has worked with nethercot for more than five years .	he says he 's seen a drastic shift in her mental outlook since she started her recreational therapy routine . "	it 's great for her well-being , her creativity and it 's doing wonders for her self-esteem , " he says .	nethercot says she plans to continue making saddles .	it 's an expensive hobby , she says , but well worth the time and money for her state of mind .	knowing how prevalent ptsd is , and how stifling it can be , she says she hopes others get help in the way she did . "	i would love to see more people get involved with recreational therapy , " nethercot says . "	i wish someone had told me i 'd be great for the recreational program . "

escalating violence in afghanistan is now the worst since the early months of the nearly 9-year-old war , killing 1,074 civilians so far this year as international forces struggle to establish security , an afghan rights group said monday .	however , the share of civilians killed by international forces is dropping ?	and the number dying in nato airstrikes has halved ?	thanks to restrictive rules of engagement issued last year , the afghanistan rights monitor said .	despite speculation that newly arrived coalition commander gen. david petraeus would change the policy , which critics say increases danger to american and other foreign troops , a nato spokesman reiterated over the weekend that would not happen .	violence has soared across afghanistan in recent months , as 30,000 more american troops arrived to bolster the international force .	the reinforcements are moving into taliban strongholds in the south and east of the country to try to strengthen afghan government control , and insurgents have responded with a wave of ambushes , suicide attacks , roadside bombs and assassinations .	the war 's escalation has taken a huge toll on the afghan people , with 212 civilians killed last month alone , said ajmal samadi , director of the independent afghanistan rights monitor , which compiled its statistics from interviews with witnesses , families of victims , local officials and media reports .	the group , which is supported by private donations , recorded 1,200 violent incidents in june , the highest number in any single month since 2002 . "	in terms of insecurity , " it said in a new report , " 2010 has been the worst year since the demise of the taliban regime . "	last month was also the deadliest of the war for coalition forces , with 103 international troops killed , 60 of them american .	the majority of the civilians killed so far this year ?	61 percent ?	died in insurgent attacks , particularly from roadside bombs the taliban plant across the country , said the group .	the rise in civilian casualties shows the international force has yet to succeed in its goal of protecting the afghan people , the centerpiece of the nato counterinsurgency strategy .	the aim is to provide security against taliban attacks to win support of the population so they will give information to authorities on the insurgents .	still , the share of accidental deaths by coalition and afghan government forces ?	which can turn people against the government and foreign troops ?	is falling , the afghan rights group said in a report .	it said international forces were responsible for 210 civilian deaths from jan. 1 to june 30 this year ?	about 20 percent of the total , down from 26 percent for the same period last year .	the 1,076 civilian deaths were up slightly over the same six months last year , but represented a sharp increase from the 684 reported by the u.n. for the same period in 2007 .	afghan soldiers and police killed 108 civilians , or about 10 percent , and insurgents were responsible for 661 deaths , or 61 percent , the report said .	the remaining 9 percent were killed by private security contracts , criminal gangs or were unclear .	accidental deaths from nato airstrikes also dropped by half , to 94 , according to the report , which credited the policy of restraint issued by former international forces commander gen. stanley mcchrystal last year that severely limits the circumstances in which troops can call in an airstrike or fire into buildings .	samadi urged petraeus , who replaced mcchrystal this month and who many credit with turning around the war in iraq , not to change those rules of engagement . "	what we are concerned about is that with the arrival of gen. petraeus ... those measures might be changed in a way that would allow international forces to use more firepower , " samadi said . "	then you could be back in a situation where more civilians could die . "	the rules are unpopular among many , including some troops who believe they cost american lives and force them to give up the advantage of overwhelming firepower to a foe who shoots and melts back into the civilian population .	nato spokesman brig. gen. josef blotz , however , stressed that petraeus is committed to the current rules of engagement . "	our strategic imperative to reduce civilian casualties has not and will not change , " he told reporters sunday .	various organizations track civilian casualties in afghanistan , with differing numbers .	afghanistan rights monitor 's statistics were higher than nato 's tally of 592 noncombatants killed in the first half of this year , 82 percent of them by insurgent attacks and the rest accidental deaths by international forces .	however , the united nations ' statistics also tend to be higher than nato 's .	the world body has not yet released its report on casualties for the first half of the year , but in 2009 its count was similar to afghanistan rights monitor 's tally .
a private u.s. congressional dispute over democracy programs in cuba has gone public , with a house committee chairwoman accusing her senate counterpart of failing to understand what she calls " the brutal nature of the havana tyranny .

placing large historical events in the context of ordinary people 's lives can bring the past back to life .	the world premiere of " banished children of eve " succeeds in this resurrection , as an absorbing , intimate melodrama about a small , diverse group of new yorkers caught up in the draft riots of 1863 , a week of racial and mob violence that tore up civil war manhattan .	writing by kelly younger , strong performances and lovely singing make for a rich theatrical evening at the irish repertory theatre , where the lively production opened on sunday .	adapted by younger from peter quinn 's historical novel of the same name , " banished " is tightly directed by ciaran o'reilly on a small , versatile set created by charlie corcoran .	the crowded , sweltering city erupted in riots on july 11 , 1863 , when a military draft was introduced that would force all men between 20 and 35 to serve in the civil war , or buy their way out for $ 300 .	this was an excuse for discontented , mostly irish mobs to pour into the streets , robbing the wealthy , fighting the ineffectual police and terrorizing new york 's black population , whom they feared would take their jobs while they were away at war .	that larger violence forms the backdrop of younger 's focus on the lives of a group of black and irish performers and neighbors over one day and night , near the notoriously unstable five points neighborhood of manhattan .	external danger is gracefully hinted at by the production team 's creative sound and lighting .	personal dramas are central , as the characters ' lives suddenly intersect as they make desperate choices under pressure to survive .	david lansbury and amber gray are poignant as lovers , irish minstrel troupe leader jack mulcahy and lead actress eliza .	she 's trying to pass for cuban to evade the ban against black actors onstage in new york city .	the couple is also sheltering a homeless black boy named squirt , played with irrepressible charm by christopher borger .	lansbury and gray are excellent in their portrayals of two people whose improbable little family seems doomed by cultural obstacles .	the featured bad guy , standing in for all thieving yankees of the day , is the unsavory waldo capshaw , played with sneering villainy by graeme malcolm .	rory duffy plays a young irishman caught up with capshaw , forced to take a nice young irish maid ( amanda quaid ) on a date so capshaw can rob her boss ' house .	patrice johnson is entertaining , if overly vigorous , as euphemia , an older , street-wise black woman who views all the proceedings with cynicism .	as the rioting in the streets escalates , these neighbors all gather for protection inside a bar that 's also frequented by once-famed american songwriter stephen foster .	foster was already a drunken has-been in 1863 , but actor malcolm gets provides a musical highlight of the play , singing a sad version of " beautiful dreamer " while accompanying himself on an upright piano .	as the riots increase in intensity outside , quaid , gray and johnson join with gets to outstandingly harmonize on another foster song , " hard times come again no more . "	o'reilly smoothly moves his cast of ten between several key locations , including a minstrel theater where jack and eliza perform the ice-floe escape scene from " uncle tom 's cabin .

louisiana has the highest rate of gun violence in the nation and the weakest gun safety laws , according to a recent national study , and state lawmakers are moving to expand the already permissive statutes .	according to the law center to prevent gun violence , a nonprofit group that tracks gun regulations around the nation , louisiana 's push is contrary to a national trend toward strengthening firearm laws after the recent connecticut mass school shooting . "	it puts louisiana in the same category as a minority of states that spend time on largely symbolic measures , " said laura cutilletta , senior staff attorney for the law center . "	these laws clearly are not going to be upheld .	it 's something the courts will have to decide , not the states . "	the most far-reaching gun proposals in the louisiana legislature seek to preempt federal law , as a states ' rights issue .	they have been easily approved in the house and await action in the senate .	one measure , by rep. jim morris , r-oil city , would prohibit enforcement of any federal restrictions on semi-automatic weapons .	after opponents of the bill repeatedly questioned the legality of the proposal , the senate delayed a vote , but supporters vowed to return for another attempt to get it passed .	another proposal , by rep. joe lopinto , r-metairie , would create the louisiana manufactured firearms and ammunition act , to allow gun buyers to circumvent any federal gun law if the weapon was manufactured in the state and remained there .	it awaits a hearing in the senate 's budget committee .	similar efforts have been tried in other states .	a montana federal appeals court is considering the merits of a state law after a lower court rejected that state 's firearms freedom act as unconstitutional .	montana was the first state to create such a law in 2009 that would prohibit federal oversight of state-made firearms .	in april , kansas lawmakers passed a bill later signed by republican gov. sam brownback that prohibits federal enforcement of any national firearm laws if the guns are state-made .	that prompted a warning letter to brownback from u.s. attorney general eric holder stating that the law violated the u.s. constitution .	around the nation , 1,152 bills were filed related to gun regulations this year .	of those , 603 sought to strengthen laws and 549 would weaken them , cutilletta said .	the trend toward boosting restrictions on guns can be attributed to the december school shooting in newtown , conn. that left 20 elementary school students and six educators dead .	they were shot with a semi-automatic weapon . "	i think that resonated with people and gave legislators a lot more courage because they knew they had the voices of the people behind them , " cutilletta said .	but in louisiana , bills aimed at toughening regulations on weapons never made it past the first debate , including one that would have required owners to secure their weapons in a locked box or with some type of safety trigger when stored in a home .	supporters of proposals to loosen gun restrictions have brushed aside colleagues ' arguments that gun access should not be expanded in a state where a study reports the number of per capital gun deaths is nearly three times higher than the national average . "	it 's important that we do n't govern by crisis , " said sen. elbert guillory , d-opelousas .	guillory and many other democrats have voted with republicans this session to advance pro-gun legislation , like a proposal by rep. jeff thompson , r-bossier city , that would make it a misdemeanor to release or publish the names and addresses of people who own or have applied for concealed handgun permits .	the bill has been backed by both the house and senate and awaits approval of a final version before heading to gov. bobby jindal 's desk .	it would carry a $ 10,000 fine for anyone who publishes the information , like reporters or bloggers .	according to a study by the left-leaning center for american progress , louisiana had more deaths per capita from guns than any other state from 2001 to 2010 .	the study indicated that louisiana has the highest gun-homicide rate among residents 19 years old and younger .	cutilletta 's organization gave the state an " f , " ranking it 45th out of 50 states in terms of gun safety .	she said there appears to be a correlation between " weak " state gun laws and the slew of bills filed in those states that seek to override or nullify federal laws .	lawmakers in 30 states , including louisiana , introduced some type of legislation this year to restrict federal oversight of gun regulations , according to data collected by the national conference of state legislatures .	although the sense of urgency for restricting possible federal gun control laws has waned since a bill to expand background checks did n't make it out of the u.s. senate earlier this year , gun advocates say laws that limit federal enforcement are needed on the books . "	it does n't mean they wo n't come back in the future , " lopinto said .

"	the second thing is that as a wife my primary concern is that my children , i just want to make sure that they 're taken care of , provided for . "	earlier this week , the congressman 's office disclosed that he has been on medical leave for two weeks and is being treated for exhaustion .	the office did not provide any details , including how long he would be away .	the disclosure was the latest incident in what has been a troubling time for jesse jackson jr. .	he is the target of a u.s. house ethics committee investigation of allegations that he was involved in discussions about raising money for then-illinois gov. rod blagojevich 's campaign in exchange for blagojevich appointing him to president barack obama 's vacated u.s. senate seat .	jackson also allegedly directed a fundraiser and longtime friend , raghuveer nayak , to buy plane tickets for a woman described as jackson 's " social acquaintance .

michigan lawmakers moved ahead wednesday with another tax-cut proposal , this time to help 360,000 homeowners and renters who lost an income tax credit as part of a republican-backed business tax cut a few years ago .	with a bipartisan and unanimous vote , the gop-led senate finance committee approved legislation to again make households earning between $ 50,000 and $ 82,650 a year eligible for the homestead property tax credit .	the credit is worth up to $ 1,200 and is more substantial for seniors and lower-income earners .	the move came a week after republican gov. rick snyder proposed raising the income cutoff for the tax credit from $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 and changing a formula so qualifying individuals get more of a break .	the same panel just two weeks ago voted to drop the income tax rate from 4.25 percent to 3.9 percent within three years , and a republican-controlled house committee next week plans to pass an income tax reduction of its own after intensely debating the plan wednesday .	the election-year maneuvering over tax relief ?	which is gaining traction partly because of a projected surplus ?	might not be resolved until may , when legislators get new revenue estimates before finalizing the next state budget .	the debate is centered on how big the tax cut should be and who should get it . "	if we 're talking a $ 100 - $ 200 million ( cut ) and we have 10 million people , if you give everybody a little break they 're not going to get much , " said state sen. dave hildenbrand , r-lowell , sponsor of the change in the property tax credit . "	if we really want meaningful tax relief , i think it makes sense to target those lower-to-middle-income people . "	an estimated 1.3 million taxpayers would pay $ 103 million less in taxes in the first year under snyder 's plan , equaling about $ 79 per filing .	refund checks would be mailed this summer because the cut also would be retroactive to last tax year .	hildenbrand initially wanted his bill to help households with less than $ 70,000 in annual income ?	more than snyder ?	but republicans agreed to a democratic amendment to raise the cutoff back to where it was in 2011 before the governor and gop lawmakers eliminated or reduced various tax exemptions to offset a $ 1.6 billion cut in business taxes .	democrats have made the $ 1.4 billion in tax hikes on individuals a top issue ahead of the november gubernatorial and legislative elections . "	this is something that could work , " said sen. rebekah warren , d-ann arbor . "	this to me is the best place we can put it . "	she said restoring the tax credit to households with less than $ 82,650 in income would provide $ 270 million in tax relief per year , 2 ?	times what snyder is proposing .	the panel also ok 'd bills to speed up a recent law that gradually no longer charges sales tax on the full price of a vehicle if the buyer has a trade-in .	also wednesday , the house tax policy committee debated a proposal to reduce the income tax rate from 4.25 percent to 4.05 percent by 2016 .	the bills would lower the rate another tenth of a percentage point starting in 2017 and in future years if tax revenue increases by a minimum amount .	the rate could not drop for two straight years .	committee chairman jeff farrington , r-utica , said he and other sponsors of the plan tried to take a " very pragmatic " approach to cutting taxes by not letting the income tax rate go below 4.05 percent unless revenue is up .	democrats , though , questioned how michigan can fix its deteriorating roads and educate kids with less money .

two f-22 fighter jets intercepted six russian military airplanes that neared the western coast of alaska , military officials said friday .	at about 1:30 a.m. thursday , two canadian cf-18 fighter jets intercepted two of the long-range bombers about 40 nautical miles ( 64 nautical kilometers ) off the canadian coastline in the beaufort sea .	lt. col. michael jazdyk , a spokesman for the north american aerospace defense command , or norad , said the u.s. jets intercepted the planes about 55 nautical miles ( 88 kilometers ) from the alaskan coast at about 7 p.m. pacific time wednesday .	the russian planes were identified as two il-78 refueling tankers , two mig-31 fighter jets and two bear long-range bombers .	they looped south and returned to their base in russia after the u.s. jets were scrambled .	in both cases , the russian planes entered the air defense identification zone , which extends about 200 miles ( 321 kilometers ) from the coastline .	they did not enter sovereign airspace of the united states or canada .	jazdyk said the fighter jets were scrambled " basically to let those aircraft know that we see them , and in case of a threat , to let them know we are there to protect our sovereign airspace . "	in the past five years , jets under norad 's command have intercepted more than 50 russian bombers approaching north american airspace .	norad is a binational american and canadian command responsible for air defense in north america .
south korea 's foreign reserves rose to their third straight record high in march as the nation 's key buffer against potential financial turmoil steadily approaches $ 300 billion .	the country 's official foreign reserves totaled $ 298.62 billion at the end of last month , the central bank said in a statement monday .	that was $ 950 million higher than the previous record of $ 297.67 billion set in february .	south korea 's reserves have climbed since falling to just above $ 200 billion in november 2008 as the country 's monetary authorities used them to help fight a shortage of dollar liquidity as credit dried up amid the global financial crisis .	foreign reserves are a key economic and policy weapon as they can be used to defend a country 's currency from speculative attack , provide liquidity and bolster the financial system .	asian countries and territories lead the world in reserve holdings .	the bank of korea said strength in the euro and other currencies , which led to an increase in the dollar value of the portion of the reserves denominated in them , as well as operating profits were behind march 's increase .	the south korean government sees its reserves as a key defense against financial turmoil .	the country has been particularly sensitive since experiencing the 1997-98 asian financial crisis that saw it receive what was perceived locally as a humiliating international bailout .	south korea 's reserves are largely invested in securities and deposits , according to the central bank .	a smaller component is a notional currency called special drawing rights , which are overseen by the international monetary fund .	gold accounts for the smallest portion .	south korea 's reserves were the world 's seventh largest behind those of china , japan , russia , taiwan , brazil and india as of the end of february , according to the central bank , which did not provide a global ranking for march .	seven of the top 10 holders of reserves in february were in asia , according to the bank .	south korea 's reserves had been the sixth largest at the end of december and had ranked as high as fifth as recently as august .	china and japan have the largest holdings of reserves .	china , which releases figures quarterly , had $ 2.8 trillion at the end of 2010 .	japan 's international reserves , meanwhile , totaled $ 1.09 trillion at the end of february , according to the country 's ministry of finance .	other asian economies among the top 10 in reserve holdings are hong kong and singapore , according to the bank of korea .
as the nation 's capital sweltered under another day of intense heat , even animals at the national zoo were turning to popsicles and air conditioning to cool off .	pandas and other animals were getting homemade frozen fruit popsicles to help stay cool wednesday .	the pandas were snacking inside their air conditioned enclosure , the orangutans were barely moving and the clouded leopard was keeping cool in the shade .	zoo spokeswoman karin korpowski-gallo said most of the animals have access to air-conditioned indoor enclosures .	the others have shady spots where they can rest .	amanda bania , the zoo 's great ape keeper , said orangutans hail from tropical climates in southeast asia , but apes in captivity are accustomed to having access to air conditioning .	before noon , they were ready to head back indoors , bania said . "	anything over 90 ( degrees ) , they tend not to be thrilled about , " she said .	the national weather service issued a heat advisory for washington until 11 p.m. temperatures were expected to teeter around 100 degrees with a heat index closer to 105 in the afternoon .	even tourists seemed to be staying indoors .	the outdoor pathways at the zoo appeared virtually empty .	the largest crowd had gathered indoors in the panda enclosure , where both giant pandas , mei xiang and tian tian , chose to munch on bamboo .	outside , a safety officer canvassed the zoo in an suv , reminding visitors to drink water .	donald williams , safety and health manager for the zoo , sent e-mails to staff members reminding them to do the same .	there have been no heat-related emergencies at the zoo , but one visitor was treated for dehydration last month .	david miller , who was visiting from scotland with his wife and daughter , said washington is even hotter than florida .	the family had visited disney world in orlando last week . "	this is extreme , " miller said .
he often looked like a comical buffoon , standing before audiences , bedecked in colorful robes , spouting words that most of the world considered nonsense .	yet the death of moammar gadhafi was a milestone in modern arab history , in some ways more significant than the overthrow of lesser autocrats in tunisia and egypt .	gadhafi was the last of the old-style arab strongmen ?	the charismatic , nationalist revolutionaries who rose to power in the 1950s and 1960s , promising to liberate the masses from the shackles of european colonialism and the stultifying rule of the arab elite that the foreigners left behind after world war ii .	he was swept aside by a new brand of revolutionary ?	the leaderless crowds organized by social media , fed up with the oppressive past , keenly aware that the rest of the world has left them behind and convinced that they can build a better society even if at the moment , they are n't sure how .	gadhafi was the last of a generation of arab leaders such as gamal abdel-nasser of egypt , hafez assad of syria and saddam hussein of iraq who emerged from poverty , rising to the pinnacle of power either through the ranks of the military or the disciplined , conspiratorial world of underground political organizations .	none of the latter crop of arab autocrats , including assad 's son bashar , yemen 's ali abdullah saleh and even egypt 's colorless , ousted president hosni mubarak , could rival them in their heyday in terms of charisma , flair , stature and power .	their model was nasser , the towering champion of arab unity who ousted western-backed king farouk in 1952 and inspired arab peoples with fiery speeches broadcast by egyptian radio from iraq to mauritania .	but nasser 's dreams of arab unity and social revival crumbled in defeat in the 1967 arab-israeli war , when israel seized east jerusalem , the west bank , the golan heights from syria and the gaza strip and sinai peninsula from egypt .	nasser died three years later , and the fellow strongmen left behind led their countries instead into a political swamp of corruption , cronyism and dictatorship now challenged by the arab spring .	the hallmark of the arab strongman was unquestioned power , the use of state media to promote a larger than life image and a ruthless security network that stifled even a whiff of dissent .	that worked in an age before the internet and global satellite television which opened the eyes of the strongman 's followers to a world without secret police and economic systems run by the leader 's family and cronies .	the arab political transformation is far from complete .	autocratic rulers are facing challenges from their own people in yemen and syria .	bahrain 's shiite majority is pressing the sunni monarchy for reform .	rulers in jordan , saudi arabia and the gulf states are maneuvering to contain the arab spring .	iraq is struggling to build a democracy eight years after american-led arms brought down saddam 's rule .	with gadhafi 's passing , however , a milestone has been passed .	the future belongs to a different style of ruler , whoever it may be .	it may be difficult to imagine that the gadhafi of his final years ?	with his flamboyant robes , dark and curly wigs and sagging , surgically altered face ?	was a trim , handsome , vigorous 27-year-old when he came to power as a strong and vigorous leader .	over the years he had become a caricature figure associated with grandiose dreams such as a " united states of africa " or seizing all of israel and sending jews " back to europe . "	even when he was younger , eccentricity was the mark of gadhafi 's public persona .	a generation ago , president ronald reagan described him as the " mad dog of the middle east , " and his fellow arab leaders such as egyptian president anwar sadat considered him a dangerous megalomaniac .	journalists covered his speeches and international visits primarily for amusement .	images of gadhafi 's final moments ?	toupee gone , terrified , confused , powerless in the grip of men who may be about to kill him ?	make the ousted tyrant appear more pitiable than powerful .	all that was far from his image when he and his comrades toppled a western-backed monarchy in 1969 in a bloodless coup , promising to transform his poor , backwater country into a modern state .	promising a new era for his people , gadhafi closed a u.s. air base , forced international oil companies to hand over most of their profits from libyan oil to the libyan state and shook the world with his unabashed support for terrorist or insurgent movements in northern ireland , palestine , latin america , africa and asia .	oil gave him a reach beyond his sparsely populated desert land and enabled him to pursue his revolutionary dreams .	in the 1980s , the lobbies of tripoli 's few hotels were populated by representatives of what the west considered the most dangerous groups on earth ?	stiff north koreans wearing lapel buttons of their leader kim il-sung , palestinian extremists huddled over cups of sweet tea , european anarchists and revolutionaries ?	all come to town to seek the oil-fueled largesse of the " brother leader . "	while insisting that libya was the freest nation on earth , gadhafi ruthlessly suppressed dissent , dispatched agents to assassinate his opponents abroad and drove thousands of libyans into exile .	it all came crashing down in the final battle in his hometown of sirte .	a man who came to power as an arab revolutionary and self-styled leader of the oppressed and downtrodden died a brutal and inglorious death at the hands of the people he purported to lead .

a california appeals court is granting a stay of a lower court 's decisions against the state 's high-speed rail project , agreeing to quickly review the rulings .	the 3rd district court of appeal granted the stay late friday .	it announced it would hear the state 's request for an expedited review of the two decisions by a sacramento county superior court judge .	judge michael kenny had ruled that the california high-speed rail authority failed to comply with the promises made to voters when they approved nearly $ 10 billion in bonds for the project in 2008 .	in separate decisions , he ordered the state to write a new funding plan outlining how it would pay for the $ 68 billion bullet train and blocked the sale of the voter-approved bonds .

president barack obama says it appears that an agreement to avoid the so-called " fiscal cliff " is " in sight , " but he says it 's not yet complete and work continues before a midnight deadline .	obama expressed regret monday afternoon that the work of his administration and congress wo n't produce a " grand bargain " to address the country 's chronic deficit spending , but he said that " with this congress , it could n't happen at that time . "	officials familiar with the negotiations say an agreement still under negotiation would address the biggest issue by raising tax rates on family income over $ 450,000 a year .	but how to handle deep spending cuts remains a problem .
the obama administration 's environmental chief dipped a small cup into the oily mess at the mouth of the mississippi and was surprised by what came out . "	oh my god ?	it 's so thick ! "	exclaimed environmental protection agency administrator lisa jackson who toured delicate coastal wetlands that have been invaded by the black and orange crude .	she was one of several top administration officials in the gulf coast this week as the white house is facing increasing questions about why the government ca n't assert more control over the handling a massive oil spill in the gulf of mexico , which unfolded after a bp offshore drilling rig blew up april 20 .	the administration 's point man on the spill rejected the notion of removing bp and taking over the crisis monday , saying the government has neither the company 's expertise nor its deep-sea equipment . "	to push bp out of the way would raise a question , to replace them with what ? "	coast guard commandant thad allen , who is heading the federal response to the spill , said at a white house briefing .	a memorial service was scheduled for tuesday afternoon in jackson , miss. , for the 11 workers who were killed when the oil rig exploded .	the event was being held by transocean , which owned the rig .	all of bp 's attempts to stop the leak have failed , despite the oil giant 's use of joystick-operated submarine robots that can operate at depths no human could withstand .	millions of gallons of brown crude are now coating birds and other wildlife and fouling the louisiana marshes .	those that jackson surveyed by boat have been battered for centuries by hurricanes and man-made canals that led to drastic erosion .	a crew used a machine to separate oil from water and slowly filled a four-foot high storage tank with crude .	for oil deeper in the marsh , little could be done and the vegetation there was expected to die . "	at a minimum what we can say is dispersants did n't work here , " jackson said . "	when you see stuff like this , it 's clear it is n't a panacea . "	jackson said she worried further erosion from oil-damaged marshes would leave her nearby hometown of new orleans even more exposed to future storms .	bp is pinning its hopes of stopping the gusher on yet another technique never tested 5,000 feet underwater : a " top kill , " in which heavy mud and cement would be shot into the blown-out well to plug it up .	the process could begin as early as wednesday , with bp ceo tony hayward giving it a 60 to 70 percent chance of success .	allen said federal law dictated that bp had to operate the cleanup , with the government overseeing its efforts . "	they 're exhausting every technical means possible to deal with that leak , " he said . "	i am satisfied with the coordination that 's going on . "	interior secretary ken salazar suggested over the weekend that the government could intervene aggressively if bp was n't delivering . "	if we find that they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , " he said .	but asked about that comment monday , allen said : " that 's more of a metaphor . "	allen said bp and the government are working together , with the government holding veto power and adopting an " inquisitorial " stand toward the company 's ideas .	bp said it is doing all it can to stop the leak .	its chief operating officer , doug suttles , made the rounds of network morning news shows to say that the company understands people are frustrated . "	clearly secretary salazar is telling us that we need to do this as expediently as we can , " suttles said . "	and of course we are . "	hayward , bp 's chief executive , walked along oil-soaked fourchon beach and said he had underestimated the possible environmental effects . "	i 'm as devastated as you are by what i 've seen here today , " hayward told reporters after he spoke with cleanup workers in white overalls and yellow boots , some shoveling oily sand into garbage cans . "	we are going to do everything in our power to prevent any more oil from coming ashore , and we will clean every last drop up and we will remediate all of the environmental damage . "	mark kellstrom , an analyst with summit , n.j.-based strategic energy research , said time might be running out for bp to continue calling the shots . "	the rhetoric is growing up in washington for the politicians to kick out bp and let the government take over , " kellstrom said , though he added that it would be a mistake .	bp had hoped to try a top kill earlier but needed more time to get equipment into place and test it .	a top kill has worked on aboveground oil wells in kuwait and iraq but has never before been attempted so far underwater .	suttles said the biggest technical challenge is that the fluid must be pumped in very quickly , and engineers need to make sure it goes into the well , not out through the leaking pipe , which could make the leak worse .	a containment device is on the seafloor , ready to be put in place if the top kill fails or makes the leak worse .	engineers are working on several other backup plans in case the top kill does n't work , including injecting assorted junk into the well to clog it up , and lowering a new blowout preventer on top of the one that failed .	the only certain permanent solution is a pair of relief wells crews have already started drilling , but the task could take at least two months .	in another source of tension between bp and the government , the company was still using a certain chemical dispersant monday to fight the oil despite orders from the environmental protection agency to employ something less toxic . "	if we can find an alternative that is less toxic and available , we will switch to that product , " said suttles .	others have blamed the administration for not doing enough , including former alaska gov. sarah palin , who said sunday on fox news that obama was being lax in his response to the spill .	white house spokesman robert gibbs called the criticism ill-informed and suggested palin needed a blowout preventer , the technical term for the device intended to prevent an oil spill from becoming a full-scale catastrophe .	the phrase has entered the political vernacular since the one on the gulf well failed . "	you 've got to have a license to drive a car in this country , but regrettably you can get on a tv show and say virtually anything , " gibbs said .

the man who helped create the book on orthopedic sports medicine is surrounded by technology that had n't been dreamed of when he began his practice in the lake area in 1971 .	then , the primary diagnostic tools were a doctor 's training and an x-ray machine , or at least access to one .	recently , in a building equipped with mri , bone density scan , digital x-ray , electronic record keeping and several other high-tech capabilities , dr. david drez reflected on the advancements he 's seen in his time . "	jiminy , " he said regarding the current tools of the trade . "	i could n't even have imagined this . "	early medical exposure drez remembers the smell of the medical profession from his childhood in dequincy .	his father , dr. david drez sr. , was a doctor ; his mother , hester bingham drez , was a nurse .	for 12 years , the family lived upstairs from the hospital his father owned . "	i remember them putting me to bed and smelling like ether , " he said . "	that was my introduction to medicine . "	upon high school graduation , it was off to tulane university , his father 's alma mater . "	i applied for medical school because of my background .	i did n't know anything else but medicine , " drez said .	he graduated from tulane medical school in 1963 .	after his internship , he took a general surgery residency at charity hospital in new orleans , south louisiana 's trauma center .	in his third year , the new orleans saints came to town .	dr. ken saer , the team 's doctor , recruited drez and other young doctors to help him perform physical exams on the players .	drez got interested in sports , which has more do with orthopedics than surgery .	he and his wife , judy , had two small children . "	so i came back home one evening and told my wife , ' you know , i think i 'd like to go into orthopedics . ' "	she said , ' you 've got to be kidding me .	you spent three years in general surgery and you want to spend another three years doing something else ? ' "	but she did n't have to be argued into agreement .	judy drez said , " it boiled down to : if you hold someone down and do n't help them achieve what they are capable of , what 's the use ? "	drez finished his orthopedic residency at tulane in 1968 .	it had included a rotation at the scottish rite hospital for children in atlanta , where he worked two or three days a month with " the real founder of sports medicine , " dr. jack houston in columbus , ga. .	building a reputation drez opened his practice in lake charles just after his mother died and just as his father retired . "	i knew i could n't be an orthopedist in dequincy , so the next best thing was lake charles , " he said .	he also began working with the team physician for mcneese state university , dr. boyd woodard . "	he was quite happy to release some of the responsibility because it 's really , during football season , it 's a seven-day-a-week , almost 24-hour-a-day job , " drez said .	he became team physician in 1973 , and outlasted eight coaches at mcneese . "	i did that until one year ago , " he said .	his work meant a great deal to the team , said former coach and athletic director ernie duplechin said players and coaches " had high , high respect for him .	( the players ) felt comfortable with whatever he said he needed to do . "	we had several guys need complete knee reconstructions .	he did the surgery , rehabbed them and they came back and played .	several of them .	my son was one of them . "	duplechin , who spent 22 years with mcneese 's athletic department , said drez would show up regularly to check on the players and " made all the trips . "	drez said he gave up the job because he no longer had the time or energy it needs .	his present private practice focuses on shoulders and knees . "	that 's where there are the most sports injuries .	it 's just a natural migration to that , " he said .	drez also helped start a program to care for high school athletes through lake charles memorial hospital , with a saturday clinic during football season and athletic trainers who traveled to schools to help manage injuries ?	or , for severe ones , recommend an orthopedist .	learning and teaching the advent of arthoscopic surgery meant new education . "	since arthoscopic surgery is so common in the treatment of athletic injuries , it just carried over and enhanced my sports medicine practice , " he said .	by the mid 1980s , drez was teaching sports medicine to lsu residents who spent three months in lake charles .	fellowships brought young doctors under his wing for extended stretches .	dr. john racanelli , an orthopedic surgeon in dallas , worked under drez at memorial hospital from july 1992 to august 1993 . "	he taught me just about everything i know about sports medicine , " racanelli said .	he said drez " spent an inordinate amount of time teaching .	most doctors just want to get the work done and not focus on instruction . "	by the book there was n't a good sports medicine book in the 1980s and early 1990s , drez said .	he and dr. jesse delee , an orthopedic surgeon now based in san antonio , collaborated on " orthopaedic sports medicine : principles and practice , " which has been published in multiple editions .	delee said it took drez and him four years to plan , line up the research and specialists ' input , edit and produce the text . "	it took lots of time out of our practices , " he said thursday . "	literally thousands of hours . "	since drez and delee were both " involved nationally in teaching and research , we knew the experts in all subspecialities .	that put us in a unique position to produce this textbook , " delee said .	the publication , delee says , is still the only textbook on sports medicine .	in a 1994 review in the new england journal of medicine , dr. william southmayd of boston described it as " the finest and most complete work ever written in the field of orthopedic sports medicine . "	the book is one of seven on drez 's r?sum ? .	drez and delee also started the journal " operative techniques in sports medicine . " "	we would choose certain topics and ask various persons who were recognized experts " to respond , " drez said . "	interestingly enough , that became one of the most popular sellers in their whole group of periodicals that the company printed . "	drez said he and delee , who consider each other dear friends , have since turned over the publications to others .	then and now before the enhancement of orthopedic diagnostic skills and technology , someone with a bum knee would likely be given the diagnosis of idk ?	internal derangement of the knee . "	it was n't very specific , " drez said . "	frequently , operations were done with that diagnosis , without any specific knowledge of what the true pathology was .	but that term has gone by the wayside with the greater diagnostic tools that are available to us , especially the magnetic resonance imaging , the mri . " "	the demands for mri have gone up exponentially .	most people do n't think they get proper treatment unless they get an mri of an injured part , " drez said .	even x-ray machines have changed , producing digital images which are available immediately . "	by the time a patient is back in the examining room , the x-ray is there ( on a monitor ) waiting on them , " drez said .	in earlier days , orthopedists , " did everything from backs to feet to knees to hips . "	through subspecialization , such as sports medicine , better diagnostic tools and abilities are brought to bear because orthopedists concentrate on certain areas , giving them more detailed knowledge of those parts , drez said .	with the progress of arthoscopic surgery , recovery from repairs , such as those to knee ligaments , are much faster .	such operations needed hospital stays in the 1980s .	now they 're outpatient surgery .	post-op procedures have also changed . "	we used to put people in a cast after ligament reconstruction .	they had a stable knee , but they also had a stiff knee , " drez said . "	now we start patients on early range of motion , which is limited .	it 's rare now to have a stiff knee after ligament surgery . "	the focus now drez , at 73 , says he understands he 'll have to scale back on his duties but has no intention of walking away from the profession .	he says he 's likely to give up surgery , " but i still want to see patients and consult . "	his plan is to turn most of his attention toward his family and home . "	a lot of it has to do with family life , and our church plays a big role in our lives , as well , " he said .	david and judy drez have three children ?	a pediatrician , an attorney and one with a master 's degree in speech and hearing ?	and eight grandchildren . "	we 've been pretty blessed , " he said .

the release of carbon dioxide into the air from power plant smokestacks to the tailpipe on cars could pose a risk to red king crab and other lucrative fisheries in alaska , a new report says .	ocean water becomes more acidic when it absorbs carbon dioxide released by human sources , such as the burning of fossil fuels .	increased ocean acidification could harm important alaska commercial and subsistence fisheries and communities that rely heavily on them , according to the new research aimed at spurring discussion on how to address the changes .	the research , led by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , was to be published tuesday in the online journal progress in oceanography .	researchers said changes in ocean chemistry could make it harder for mollusks and other small creatures to build and keep their skeletons or shells .	previous studies have shown red king crab and tanner crab grow more slowly in more acidic water and that red king crab died in highly acidified conditions .	communities in southeast and southwest alaska face the highest risk from ocean acidification because of their reliance on fishing , relatively lower income levels and fewer job alternatives than other parts of alaska , the report states .	for communities with high food and energy costs , ocean acidification could be another hit , the research says .	according to the noaa , alaska 's high-latitude coastal waters are more vulnerable to acidification because cold water can absorb more carbon dioxide .	circulation patterns also bring more acidic deep-ocean water to the surface , the agency said .	co-lead author of the study , noaa oceanographer jeremy mathis , said the goal was to try to quantify the potential risk and impacts from ocean acidification , a question that 's come up in meetings with fishermen , villages and communities but one he 's never had a good answer for .	while direct , harmful impacts are n't showing up yet , the ocean is changing quickly , he said .	oceans are about 30 percent more acidic today than they were at the start of the industrial revolution , he said .	if fossil fuels continue to be burned at the current rate , ph levels could drop significantly by the end of the century , said mathis , who is also director of an ocean acidification research center at the university of alaska fairbanks . "	we could have a 300 percent greater change between now and the end of the century than we have in the past 250 years combined , " he said . "	so the rate of change is what 's accelerating . "	mathis said lab studies have shown a low level of tolerance for acidification in crab , but those impacts have n't been seen in the wild yet .	as the oceans change , there are some who believe species will adapt or new organisms will emerge , and that could happen , he said .	but acidification also could change population dynamics , he said .

republican gov. chris christie nominated a democratic insider to take control of new jersey 's transportation department at a key moment for the future of funding road work .	christie announced thursday that he was picking for transportation commissioner jamie fox , who was a top aide to two democratic former officials ?	gov. jim mcgreevey and u.s. sen. robert torricelli .	he served as mcgreevey 's chief of staff and as deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey and had posts in the democrats ' 2000 u.s. senate campaign and president barack obama 's 2008 campaign .	more than a decade ago , he had a previous stint as transportation commissioner .	in a brief statement to reporters thursday , fox said that was the best job he had ever had .	democratic lawmakers quickly praised christie 's choice , an indication that fox will not have a hard time being confirmed by the state senate .	fox would be returning to the department amid debate over how to fund road repairs and a discussion of whether it should be merged with the new jersey transit , the new jersey turnpike authority and other transportation agencies .	the fund for the transportation projects is running out of money .	officials say that by sometime next year , the fund , which is supported by taxes on gasoline , will not be bringing in enough money even to cover the debt for past road projects .	a coalition of new jersey business groups and planning advocates announced a campaign this week calling for investment in road upgrades and a new funding source for the depleted transportation trust fund .	the forwardnj group says the state should be raising $ 2 billion a year to support infrastructure and transit repairs and upgrades , saying that that the cost of not making improvements is even greater .	the group has not endorsed a specific tax hike but has laid out several as options .	the group says that improving roads would save commuters time and would also provide construction and other jobs .	state senate president steve sweeney has been visiting aging bridges to make the same call .	christie generally has opposed tax increases , but said thursday that he would consider all options for replenishing the fund .	when a reporter asked thursday about the possibility of raising the gasoline tax , christie would not answer specifically . "	is there something about ' everything 's on the table ' that 's confusing to you ? "	he asked .	the forwardnj group also called for the transportation-agency merger .	christie said it 's " not nearly as simple as some have presented it " but said he 's open to the possibility .	the previous transportation commissioner , james simpson , announced in may that he was leaving office in june .

one of every four mexican immigrant workers in new mexico saw wages improperly withheld or not fully paid last year , according to new study released thursday .	the survey said more than 20 percent of immigrants who were legally allowed to work in the state reported being victims of wage theft .	close to 30 percent of immigrants living in the country and state illegally say they experienced some type of wage abuse , according to the study sponsored by the santa fe-based immigrant advocacy group somos un pueblo unido and university of new mexico political science professor andrew schrank .	yet few immigrants in new mexico reported the abuse to authorities .	asked why , they cited fear of retaliation , lack of knowledge , and concerns about the bureaucracy or proper channels , the study said .	shrank and officials with somos un pueblo unido discussed details of the report during a news conference at the new mexico attorney general 's office . "	workplace violations tend to cluster , " schrank said . "	workers who suffer wage theft are also more likely to suffer verbal and physical abuse , forced overtime , denial of rest periods , and the like . "	he added that the study showed abuse is n't randomly distributed across the labor market but is perpetrated by the same employers .	gabriela guzman , an attorney for somos un pueblo unido 's worker center , said new mexico laws need to be strengthened to prevent wage theft . "	wage theft not only further impoverishes low-income families , it hurts our local economies and puts businesses that are following the rules at a disadvantage , " guzman said .	in 2009 , new mexico became one of the first states to pass anti-wage theft legislation giving all workers the right to file claims against employers who withhold wages for work completed .	the law provides triple damages and protects workers from retaliation .

u.s. rep. peter defazio on thursday toured an abandoned copper mine in southwestern oregon that is on the superfund list of major pollution sites as he prepares to file legislation to overhaul the nation 's primary mining law .	defazio , d-ore. , said the formosa mine , which is on federal and private land outside riddle , illustrates what is wrong about the 1872 mining act : the canadian companies that reopened the mine in the 1990s have disappeared , the bond put up for cleanup was nowhere near enough to cover the true costs , and the federal government never got a penny in royalties .	the u.s. environmental protection agency put the mine on its superfund list in 2007 and expects to have a cleanup plan ready this summer , epa project manager chris cora said .	the cost could ultimately exceed $ 20 million , and the agency has given up trying to find the owners .	the mine produced copper and zinc from 1910 to 1937 .	it was reopened in 1989 by formosa exploration inc. and its canadian parent company , formosa resources corp. .	it shut down in 1993 .	in 1997 , the system for controlling acidic water draining out of the mine failed , degrading 13 miles of creeks leading to salmon and steelhead habitat .	since 1994 , state and federal agencies have spent $ 3 million on cleanup and investigations , more than three times the original bond of $ 900,000 .	that bond was required by the oregon department of geology and mineral industries .	at the time , the portion on u.s. bureau of land management land was too small to require bonding , blm oregon geologist tim barnes said .	the cleanup plan will involve plugging the entrance of the leaking mine tunnel with concrete and moving tailings to a landfill on site , cora said .	defazio , who is seeking a 15th term in congress , acknowledged that the bill has little chance of passage this year in the republican-controlled house , but he wants to raise awareness about how the current system costs taxpayers billions of dollars for cleanup of pollution caused by mining with little chance of getting payment from foreign developers who set up shell companies . "	i do n't give it any chance that it will happen this congress , " defazio said in an interview . "	but i 'm going to lay down a marker .	the totally inadequate bonding requirement to protect the public interest is very hard to defend .	elements of reform should be bipartisan .	i wo n't say they are right now , but i 'm going to work on it . "	the 1872 mining act was intended to encourage settlement of the vast open spaces of the west .	as those spaces have filled in , it has proved difficult to change , no matter which party controls congress .	defazio noted that when democrats controlled the house , they twice passed reforms , but they each stalled in the senate .	last year , with republicans in control , the house passed legislation to speed up the permitting process for mineral exploration on federal lands and set time limits for lawsuits challenging mining projects .	it stalled in the senate .	the act makes no demands for bonding to cover future cleanup costs , but blm , which administers 258 million acres across the west and alaska , does .	however , a 2011 government accountability office report for congress found that those bond payouts often fall below the ultimate costs .	the gao report found that there were at least 161,000 abandoned hard-rock mines in the western u.s. and alaska , and at least 33,000 of those had left behind pollution , such as contaminated surface and ground water , and arsenic-laden tailings piles .	from 1997 to 2008 , federal agencies spent $ 2.6 billion to reclaim abandoned hard-rock mines on federal , state , private and indian lands , the report said national mining association spokesman luke popovich said the organization felt current bonding requirements were adequate , and while mining companies would be willing to talk about a modest royalty to the government on net revenues , the 8 percent royalty defazio has proposed on gross revenues for new mining projects is " a non-starter . " "	it would simply kill any new investment in mining in the united states for metals minerals at a time we are seeing a manufacturing revival , " he said .	under defazio 's bill , existing mines would pay a 4 percent royalty .	those making less than $ 100,000 a year would get exemptions .	proceeds would go to a cleanup fund .	defazio also wants to make permanent the current moratorium on patenting mining claims .	the patent system allows mining claim-holders to take ownership for $ 2.50 an acre if they can prove valuable mineral reserves .
virginia 's unemployment rate fell slightly in october after three months of increases as the state added jobs and more people reported working .	the u.s. labor department said tuesday the state 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in october was 6.4 percent .	that 's down from 6.5 percent in september and 6.7 percent a year ago .	the rate had been decreasing since peaking at 7.2 percent from december 2009 to february 2010 , but rose slightly from july through september this year . "	i think it 's good , " said ann lang , a senior economist with the virginia employment commission . "	the rate at least is down slightly but still down .	i think it 's encouraging , but it 's just an uncertain time , so that is a factor . "	virginia 's rate is still below the national average , which fell slightly to 9 percent in october .	unemployment rates fell in three-quarters of u.s. states last month , a sign that many parts of the country are experiencing modest job gains .	nationwide , employers added a modest 80,000 net jobs last month .	the previous two months were revised to show much stronger gains .	still , at least 125,000 jobs a month are needed to keep up with population growth , and at least double that amount to rapidly reduce the unemployment rate .	virginia 's unadjusted unemployment rate , which is not adjusted for seasonal employment , decreased to 6 percent in october , below the rate last month and a year ago .	the unadjusted unemployment rate usually declines in october , with the employment buildup in public and private schools and colleges , the state agency said .	the state 's nonfarm payroll employment increased by 26,900 jobs in october .	increases were seen in total government , private education and health services , trade and transportation , construction , finance , manufacturing , and mining .	the professional and business services sector in virginia saw job gains after three months of declines .	state officials said 54,123 virginians were receiving regular unemployment benefits in october , up from 52,137 in september and down from 64,541 in october 2010 .

jurors began deliberating friday whether to recommend the death penalty for a former karate instructor who led a group of men dressed like ninjas to rob and kill a wealthy florida couple .	state attorney bill eddins told jurors that patrick gonzalez jr. deserves to be executed for the grisly slayings of byrd and melanie billings , known for adopting children with special needs .	nine of the children were home when their parents were killed .	eddins said gonzalez continued to torment melanie billings after shooting her husband in each leg and in the head . "	he let her stand there and watch him shoot her husband down like a dog , " eddins said . "	that is obviously cruel and unusual punishment . "	he suggested that melanie billings ' last thoughts before she died must have been whether the men would turn their guns on the children .	they were not hurt .	the jury of 11 women and one man convicted gonzalez of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of home-invasion robbery late thursday after a half day of deliberations .	they began the sentencing phase early friday .	gonzalez appeared in court in handcuffs , watched by six uniformed and armed deputies .	he had been subdued throughout much of the trial but became agitated during closing statements .	he twisted in his chair , pointed at his attorney with his cuffed hands and was animated while whispering with another of his attorneys .	after jurors left the courtroom and he was being led away in handcuffs , he pointed his fingers at two photographers ?	one for true tv and another for the pensacola news journal . "	i can not wait to say goodbye to you and to you , " he said , according to the photographers .	earlier friday , gonzalez told judge nicholas geeker that he did not want to allow his wife and mother to testify on his behalf .	after conferring with his attorneys , he reluctantly changed his mind .	gonzalez said he had been tried and convicted by the press and did n't want his relatives subjected to media scrutiny .	gonzalez asked his family be allowed to testify without the media present and geeker denied the request , saying that the trial was open to the public .	pointing at gonzalez , defense attorney randall etheridge asked jurors in his closing statements to spare his client 's life .	he said gonzalez had done good things in the past , including teaching karate to many young children and being a good father . "	a vote for life does n't diminish his responsibility for what he did , " etheridge said .	he handed jurors a photograph of gonzalez , his wife and their six children and then named each of the jurors and told them that any one of them could make the difference between life and death for his client .	gonzalez 's mother , terry poff , asked jurors to " look into their hearts " when deciding whether to recommend death for her son .	poff said he was diagnosed at a young age with a behavior disorder but that he excelled at karate and quickly became a black belt .	she said he struggled with a prescription painkiller addition in later years .	his wife , tabitha gonzalez , testified that he became addicted to drugs and alcohol and the addictions changed his personality .
the connections people form in the course of outdoor pursuits have a tendency to grow and spread .	such was the relationship between bob luna and mark r. ecker ii , a colorado elk guide and a soldier who lost both of his legs in iraq .	theirs is a relationship that has grown into an annual event involving most of the town of delores , colo. , as luna would describe it .	and this coming year it will involve two oklahoma veterans who have been awarded the purple heart .	the purpose of this column is to help in the search for veterans who fit that description , so if you know a purple heart recipient who likes to hunt , make sure they hear about this .	ecker called luna four years ago seeking his advice .	the wounded veteran had elk tags and asked the southwest colorado guide how to start planning a hunt ; not an easy task for a double-amputee .	but they hit it off , and luna invited ecker to his lodge . "	i told him to come and bring his friends and his family , " he said .	the soldier showed up with family and five other guys , luna said . "	it 's turned into the best thing i 've ever done , " he said .	they stayed at luna 's lodge , hunted , had a great time and were invited to return the next year .	the meeting inspired luna to offer hunts to other veterans .	friends of the nra and safari club international got involved and figured out a way to turn luna 's generosity into a fundraiser and to find a way to bring more hunters to the lodge .	ecker was killed in a car accident last year , but his family still traveled to delores for the january hunt .	this year , 20 hunters will be invited to luna 's colorado hunting expeditions for what is now the mark r. ecker ii memorial hunt , which will include a banquet night in delores . "	they stay out here at the lodge with us , but so many people want to meet these guys and just shake their hand , we planned the banquet for a bigger place , " luna said . "	the whole community gets involved .	it keeps growing and growing . "	i tell you , i 've met so many wonderful people with this it 's just amazing , it 's amazing , " luna said .	the only costs for the veterans are travel expenses to the destination and a license for the special cow elk season , which opens jan. 15 .	friends of the nra is raffling an alaska brown bear hunt , and those who buy tickets will know that part of the proceeds go to cover expenses for the veterans ' hunt , said darren delong , senior nra director for oklahoma .	regional directors met recently and divvied up the elk slots and left it to each area to decide how to hand them out , he said .	oklahoma has two slots to give away , and officials are looking for people to put their names into the hat .	no money , they just need names . "	we want to get them to purple heart veterans , " delong said . "	any chance to recognize these guys and give them our thanks is something we want to do ... but finding them is n't as easy as you might think . "	tulsa attorney bruce freeman , with green country friends of the nra , has been attending american legion and vfw group meetings locally and asked if i might help spread the word .	winners do n't have to be experienced elk hunters ; the main thing is they have to get a hunter safety education card and apply for an elk tag , luna said .	everything lodging , food , guides and meat processing is provided , luna said . "	we take good care of them , and we all have a great time , " luna said .	freeman said they need oklahoma names as soon as possible .	all the names will be put in a pot , and winners will be drawn in late march so they have ample time to meet colorado 's april 6 permit application deadline .

anger around a 30-year-old religious clash in india that left thousands dead has crept into one of the closest and most expensive congressional races in the united states .	some sikh political activists and the california republican party are campaigning against democratic rep. ami bera , saying he refuses to acknowledge the alleged involvement of the indian government in the anti-sikh rioting in 1984 .	bera , a physician , is the only indian-american in congress .	other sikh leaders are planning a fundraiser for bera this weekend , dismissing the opposition as a fringe group that does n't represent their religious community .	they praise bera , a unitarian who was raised hindu by indian immigrant parents , as a valuable advocate for all south asians .	sikhism is a monotheistic religion with roots in modern-day punjab that emphasizes equality and good works .	male followers often wear turbans .	in california , sikhs have a long history as farmers in the central valley .	bera 's 7th congressional district , which is about evenly divided between democrats and republicans , has about 6,000 registered voters of indian descent , according to political data inc. , a california firm that provides detailed breakdowns of voting districts .	the race between bera and republican doug ose , a former congressman , has attracted more than $ 4 million from outside interest groups .	the margin of victory in november is expected to be razor-thin , so even a small-scale revolt from within a single ethnic community could help tilt the election .	a group of activists calling itself american sikhs for truth plans to send 1,500 anti-bera mailers in english and punjabi to sikh households and to deploy volunteers on the streets in the coming days .	the massacre of sikhs marks one of the darkest periods of sectarian violence in recent indian history .	after violently suppressing a sikh insurgency and an army attack on the holiest sikh site , prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by her sikh bodyguards in 1984 .	her killing prompted anti-sikh rioting across northern states that left more than 3,000 people dead , some hacked to death and others burned alive .	government officials have been accused of inciting then ignoring the violence .	ahead of the clash 's anniversary in november , a group of sikhs asked congressional candidates in northern california whether the deaths happened with government assistance or lack of intervention , and if they would pursue justice for the victims ' families .	bera 's campaign was among 10 that did not answer the questions .	in a prepared statement to the associated press , bera called the killings a tragedy and said he is " hopeful that the indian government has learned from the past . "	voters who are critical of his stance say bera is bending to pressure not to offend prominent indian-american campaign donors in america or the government of india .	most sikhs in the u.s. care more about domestic policy than foreign policy and " homeland politics , " said karthick ramakrishnan , a political science professor at the university of california , riverside and director of the national asian american survey .

the u.s. economy was stuck in a worsening credit crisis , but tommy wu was seemingly on top of the world during the black tie dinner the night of nov. 29 , 2007 .	the hong kong native was being honored at new york 's pierre hotel by the american banker publication for turning a sleepy san francisco chinatown savings and loan into one of the nation 's largest banking companies serving chinese americans .	wu gave an emotional speech , thanking his wife , jessa , for her support while he led the 1998 management buyout of what was to become united commercial bank .	earlier that same year , united commercial became the first u.s. financial institution to purchase outright a mainland china bank ?	a crowning achievement for wu and his bank .	the company 's stock was soaring on the back of the bank 's extraordinary growth .	united had doubled in size in the eight years since its initial public offering and wu was reaching for even greater heights , feverishly opening offices across the country and in hong kong , taiwan and china .	today , wu is facing mounting legal problems and united commercial is no more ?	federal regulators shuttered it in november 2009 and its corporate parent filed for bankruptcy .	regulators charge wu 's pursuit of the chinese bank and worldwide acclaim is at the center of united 's spectacular collapse ?	a failure that will cost taxpayers more than $ 3 billion and has led to the first criminal prosecutions of senior executives of banks that received part of the federal government 's $ 700 billion bailout of financial institutions .	the nearly $ 300 million government bailout united received is gone and federal regulators estimate the bank 's failure will cost taxpayers another $ 2.5 billion in deposit insurance .	the securities and exchange commission said united is one of the 10 largest bank failures during the financial crisis . "	this is a case about a modest , regional financial institution that , through the hubris of its central leader ( defendant thomas " tommy " wu ) and with the complicity , and inattention of its directors and officers , went on a mad quest to be an international player , " lawyers for the government-appointed trustee overseeing united 's bankruptcy case wrote to a judge .	the trustee is seeking millions of dollars in damages from wu and the carrier that provided him with directors and officer insurance , a standard policy at most companies that cover legal expenses and damages incurred by executives . "	he was the central force in causing the company to leave the path of a modest , regional bank holding company and attempt to make it a global powerhouse_and himself a global player , " the trustee 's lawyers wrote .	one of those lawyers , thomas koegel , said thursday he could n't comment further because the case has been sent to a mediator who ordered confidentiality .	wu 's attorneys say their client is being made a scapegoat for the financial crisis and is being singled out by authorities under fire for failing to charge high-ranking executives responsible for the industry 's near-collapse . "	hundreds of banks have failed in the financial crisis and the regulators need to blame someone , " wu 's attorney steven bauer said in a statement to the media this past week . "	thomas wu is counting on our justice system to clear his good name . "	the bank was known as united federal savings and loan when it first opened its doors in 1974 with a plan to serve san francisco 's growing chinese-american community with mortgages and small business loans .	wu and his wife arrived in san francisco in 1991 to oversee the business for its then-hong kong corporate parent , first pacific bank .	seven years later , wu led a $ 120 million management buyout of the savings and loan , changed its charter to a bank and offered shares of the company to the public .	during his 2007 speech in new york accepting the award for community banker of the year , wu recalled how difficult it was to pull off the first management buyout of a u.s. financial institution in 1998 . "	we sold everything we had back then to raise the cash , " american banker quoted him as saying in an article about the dinner .	he and his wife bought a mansion in the tony san francisco suburb of hillsborough and ingratiated themselves to the city 's high society .	they donated generously to the san francisco symphony and wu served on its board of governors until august 2010 .	they appeared often in publications chronicling the rich and famous at symphony openers , fundraisers and other civic causes .	while wu was at the helm , the bank 's assets grew from $ 2 billion to more than $ 13 billion .	he publicly proclaimed his desire to grow the bank 's assets to as much as $ 20 billion by 2010 .	instead , wu is facing myriad legal challenges over his management of the bank .	the sec has filed a lawsuit seeking millions , the federal deposit insurance corp. wants to bar him from the industry and he is still the focus of a criminal probe .	two of wu 's former subordinate executives ?	ebrahim shabudin and thomas yu ?	were indicted this past week on fraud charges for allegedly covering up bad loans and lying to auditors and government regulators about the bank 's health .	each faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years if convicted .	lawyers for shabudin and yu did n't return phone calls .	prosecutors say the bank 's loan portfolio ballooned from $ 4.4 billion in 2004 to more than $ 8 billion three years later .	but by 2008 , prosecutors and regulators allege , an overwhelming number of the bank 's loan recipients were defaulting , including lenny dykstra , the former professional baseball player and financier now jailed awaiting trial on bankruptcy fraud and other charges , who owes the failed bank $ 1.1 million .	robert khuzami , the sec 's enforcement chief , said the " charges reflect an all too familiar pattern ?	corporate executives once seen as rising stars embrace deception to avoid losses and conceal negative news , with investors and the fdic insurance fund left to pick up the pieces .

japan 's growth accelerated in the july-september quarter thanks to robust consumer spending , offering a rare piece of positive economic news that is likely to prove fleeting .	all signs indicate that the uptick is temporary , and momentum will almost certainly fade as slowing exports and a persistently strong yen take their toll on the world 's no. 3 economy .	japan will be lucky if it can eke out growth in the fourth quarter .	first , the good news .	real gross domestic product ?	a measure of the value of all goods and services produced ?	expanded at an annualized rate of 3.9 percent over the three-month period , marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth , the cabinet office said monday .	the result outpaced kyodo news agency 's average market forecast for an annualized 2.6 percent increase and beats a revised 1.8 percent expansion in the april-june period .	on a quarterly basis , the annualized figure translates to 0.9 percent growth from the previous three months .	japan benefited from higher spending by businesses and consumers , who rushed to buy eco-friendly vehicles before government incentives expired .	unusually high temperatures drove sales of summer drinks and clothes , while tobacco demand jumped as smokers stocked up on cigarettes ahead of an oct. 1 tax hike .	private consumption , which accounts for about 60 percent of gdp , rose 1.1 percent from the previous quarter , the figures showed .	capital investments by companies climbed 0.8 percent .	economists warn , however , that because one-time factors fueled last quarter 's numbers , the vigor is unlikely to last .	slowing global demand is undermining exports and factory production , while a strong yen continues to batter companies ' bottom lines .	exporters like automakers , who have driven japan 's recovery , are particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations .	when the yen climbs , they lose .	a strong yen shrinks the value of their overseas earnings when brought back to japan and makes their products more expensive in foreign markets .	monday 's figures also showed that china maintained its hold as the world 's no. 2 economy , with japan coming up short for the second straight quarter .	in dollar terms , japan 's nominal gdp came to $ 1.372 trillion compared with china 's $ 1.415 trillion , according to calculations by the cabinet office .	japan still maintained a tiny lead over china for the january-september period but is expected to fall behind its booming asian rival for the full calendar year .	after the gdp report , japan 's economy minister was n't in a mood to celebrate .	instead , he warned of a darker outlook . "	our economy is stalling as output is weakening , " said banri kaieda in a written statement , according to kyodo .	goldman sachs has said it expects growth to " contract significantly " in the fourth quarter .	barclays capital expect the economy to contract in october-december for the first time in five quarters .	worried about looming threats , prime minister naoto kan 's cabinet approved last month $ 63 billion in new stimulus spending .	the package , which includes financial support for small businesses and local economies , will help lift gdp by 0.6 percentage points , the government estimates .	the government has pressed japan 's central bank to do more to fight deflation and spark life into the economy .	it cut interest rates to virtually zero last month and introduced a 5 trillion yen ( $ 61 billion ) program to buy japanese government bonds and other assets in an effort to spur lending .	kyohei morita , chief economist at barclays capital japan , is n't impressed with the government 's track record so far and says he does not " expect much " from its latest stimulus package .	moreover , monetary policies by the central bank generally take one to two years to actually lift growth . "	on balance , we believe government action is the best solution but see continued pressure on the boj as the most likely approach , " morita said in a note to clients .
classrooms could be filled with christmas trees , menorahs and other religious holiday imagery under a bill filed by an arkansas lawmaker who wants to defend teachers and students who wish to celebrate christmas at school .	the proposal would allow a district to showcase a winter holiday item as long as the display includes a secular scene or symbol , or an image from another religion .	it would bar schools from encouraging the practice of a particular religion through a display .	the bill also states that students and teachers at a school can say , " merry christmas , " '' happy hanukkah " and " happy holidays . "	republican rep. justin harris of west fork said he wants to protect people who are worried about being politically correct or offensive .	but attorney sam groveran with the freedom from religion foundation said such a law is n't needed , noting that people are already able to use such holiday greetings at school . "	it 's unfortunate that rep. harris feels the need to waste the general assembly 's time in order to pander to religious constituents , " grover said . "	this bill is unnecessary ; it does n't change the law in any way . "	harris said he was partly inspired to draft the bill , patterned after a 2013 texas law , after schools in his district started calling the december vacation " winter break . " "	it is a christmas break , " harris said monday . "	i think this will give the schools the choice to be able to use christmas break but will also give teachers the choice to use christmas . "	only christmas and hanukkah are mentioned specifically in the bill .	harris said his intent is not to be divisive , and that he 's open to adding language to include some other holidays , specifically kwanzaa . "	i think that 's an important holiday for the african-american community , " harris said . "	the reason i did n't put it in there is because it 's after the christmas holiday . "

mergers and acquisitions could pick up among property and casualty insurance companies as stock values remain at record low levels , insurance prices remain soft , and many companies have accumulated cash stockpiles , an analyst said thursday .	fbr capital markets analyst bijan moazami said in a note to investors his review of the industry shows at least a few companies ripe for takeover .	his analysis focused on the financial incentives chief executives have for selling .	they include stock holdings , potential change of control payments , and compensation information for the ceos .	the most likely candidates are xl group plc , a dublin , ireland , diversified insurer operating in 27 countries , and eastern insurance holdings inc. , a lancaster , penn.-based company focusing on casualty , worker 's compensation , and specialty reinsurance .	moazami said his thoughts on xl group are based in part on the political aspirations ceo mike mcgavick has shown in the past .	mcgavick was a candidate for u.s. senate in 2006 .	he also would be paid a $ 16.6 million payout in the event of a sale , which includes cash severance , a bonus and stock options .	eastern insurance is an excellent candidate for an acquisition because of its attractive mix of business to companies seeking to increase market share in the northeast , moazami said .	ceo bruce eckert is 66 and would get a $ 2.5 million payout if the company is bought .	insurers may be scouting around for acquisitions because a soft insurance market makes organic growth difficult unless a company is willing to cut rates , which hurts profitability , moazami said . "	on the other hand , growth via acquisition allows for the renewal of policies at much more acceptable rates , " moazami said .	acquisitions often allow for cost cutting measures including staff cuts and more efficient business processes , which improve profit margins .	with stock values at low levels , acquiring assets below economic value is possible , making acquisitions attractive , moazami wrote .	shares of insurers were trading mostly lower in morning trading , following the downward trend of the broader market as investors sold stocks on the latest economic indicators suggesting only modest growth in the united states .	xl group was down 17 cents at $ 20.25 .	eastern was one of the few exceptions among major insurers showing an uptick .	shares rose 37 cents , or 3.6 percent , to $ 10.70 .	allstate corp. shed 1 cent to $ 30.48 , while hartford financial services group inc. fell 23 cents to $ 22.74 .

"	each panel would include representatives from higher education , business , agriculture , labor , and other sectors , including state agencies who would set regional priorities .	according to the campaign , there are 115 industrial development agencies statewide , 618 local development corporations , 72 empire zones that offer tax breaks to business and 50 business improvement districts .	there are also dozens of government agencies , urban renewal agencies and regional planning councils all working on economic development statewide . "	we 're fighting amongst ourselves for the same scraps , " cuomo said in syracuse , where he toured bitzer scoll inc. manufacturing operations .	when asked how his plan would avoid simply creating another layer of government , cuomo said the other agencies would be consolidated or eliminated over time .	duffy said the goal is to have a region 's agencies work together to figure out how that would be accomplished .	the plan , however , does n't spell out how cuomo , if elected , would fund all the new initiatives as the state faces huge budget deficits in the coming years .	however , his plan says that the current incentives are often misguided and poorly targeted aid needs to be refocused .	for the regional councils , cuomo proposes to set aside one-third of economic development funds .	the remaining two thirds would be awarded based on competition between regions to ensure the largest initiatives have sufficient funding .	unclear is where regional boundaries would be drawn - though a campaign spokesman said buffalo , rochester-finger lakes and syracuse likely would be separate regions - and how money would be divided between regions .	duffy said awards would be performance-based , not tied to politics or population .	the state spends an estimated $ 2 billion annually on tax credits and debt service .	other aid to businesses , excluding capital projects , have been estimated at more than $ 183 million annually .	paladino quickly knocked cuomo 's plan . "	andrew cuomo 's newest plan to create jobs is more of the same big talk , big money and big failures new yorkers have come to expect from career politicians , " paladino said in a statement . "	new york businesses will grow and hire more employees only if we cut taxes - not slow the rate of tax growth - and cut spending - not slow the rate of spending growth . "	upstate new york has been struggling economically due to population declines and a loss of jobs , particularly in the manufacturing sector .	from april 2008 through december 2009 , new york lost 352,700 private sector jobs , while unemployment hit a 26-year high of almost 9 percent , cuomo 's report says .	in upstate , the manufacturing employment base has declined 32 percent over the past decade .	meanwhile , 2 million new yorkers have left the state over the last decade , cuomo said .	cuomo 's plan also speaks to cutting spending and , in syracuse , he stressed , " new york is not going to have a future being one of the highest taxes states in the nation .	that 's a non-starter . "	he has proposed a state spending cap and a property-tax cap .	while cuomo declined to respond to paladino , duffy did , saying " it 's easy to sit back and throw rocks at somebody else 's plan when you do not have one of your own . "	kenneth adams , president of the state business council , said cuomo 's plan includes many of the proposals the group has been pushing , such as the tax and spending caps and reforms to the workers compensation program . "	it does advance a lot the key reforms that the business council has advocated for for a long time .	so it 's a solid plan , " adams said .	outside the bitzer plant in syracuse , green party gubernatorial candidate howie hawkins handed out a one-paged outline of his economic plan that called for a return to the progressive income tax and investment in schools and transportation .	includes reporting by wgrz reporter michael wooten in buffalo .	to review andrew cuomo 's economic development plan , visit www.andrewcuomo.com/nyworks carl paladino 's platform can be viewed at www.paladinoforthepeople.com

( ap ) ?	a slump in gambling at west virginia 's racetracks has crimped the state 's crucial lottery revenues , adding a dark spot to an otherwise bright financial picture for the recently completed budget year , state lawmakers learned wednesday .	net revenues from the video lottery machines at the four tracks missed their $ 280 million estimate for the year by nearly $ 22 million or 8 percent , state budget director mike mckown told the joint finance committee .	they also fell below the previous year 's collections .	mckown cited competition from neighboring states and the economy as factors . "	we are starting to see downward trends in our lottery , " mckown told the house-senate interim panel . "	i think next year , when the governor presents his budget , you 're going to see estimates in the out years much lower than what we 've normally been collecting in the last few years . "	revenues from casino table games ?	most of which are hosted at the tracks ?	and video machines at bars and clubs each topped their projections .	expected to yield a combined $ 215 million for the year that ended june 30 , they together beat that figure by $ 17 million .	traditional lottery games fell $ 1.2 million short of their $ 37.5 million mark .	lottery revenues fund an array of needs , from the state 's promise college scholarship and programs for seniors to tourism efforts and construction bonds .	the year 's revenues failed to provide nearly $ 65 million in lottery-supported spending that the legislature included in the 2010-2011 budget .	the state had to tap unspent lottery revenues from prior years to pay for that spending , mckown said . "	the downward trend was even sharper than we had anticipated , " he said .	mckown also reminded lawmakers that they balanced the current budget with $ 48 million from those unspent funds .	that leaves just $ 40.8 million in lottery-derived reserves ?	reserves that the state would again have to drain if this year 's lottery revenues fall short . "	that fund has become stressed , " mckown warned the committee . "	there are a lot of bond debt service payments dedicated to that fund .	we 've just about maxed out our lottery ... we 've got to be careful to watch that in upcoming years . "	other areas of the budget saw much rosier outcomes during the year .	officials have previously touted how 2010-2011 general tax revenues exceeded their estimates by $ 322 million .	mckown said wednesday that state agencies and programs also did not spend $ 118 million allotted for them in that budget .	just over $ 110 million of that was returned to those agencies and programs for this year 's spending , while the remaining $ 8.3 million was added to the surplus .	counting unspent surplus from prior years , mckown pegged the overall surplus at nearly $ 339 million .	the state deposited $ 150 million of that into its emergency reserves .	these two rainy day funds now total $ 818.3 million ?	more than 20 percent of general revenue spending ?	mckown said .	the main reserve fund , containing $ 499 million , equals 12.25 percent of general revenue spending .	that leaves it poised to trigger the eventual repeal of the sales tax on groceries passed in special session last month .	lawmakers agreed to link the elimination of the food tax to reserve levels .	state road fund revenues also topped both the year 's estimates and the previous year 's collections .	the provided $ 663 million , or $ 37 million more than expected .	fuel taxes accounted for $ 397 million of the total , and came in $ 17.7 million above their projection .	mckown noted that this revenue source has proved volatile , and that the fund overall remains chronically short when compared to construction , repair and maintenance needs . "	the cost of repairing roads , all those costs certainly have climbed more than how our revenues are increasing , " mckown told lawmakers . "	the road fund will need some serious looking-at in the upcoming years , to keep it sustained . "

forecasters say the sudden cold snap that hit pennsylvania over the weekend was a little late but not unprecedented .	aaron tyburski , a forecaster with the national weather service in state college says the weekend cold snap came from an arctic high pressure system that came down from canada , and light winds and clear skies helped temperatures to cool off in the evening .	temperatures dropped to 38 degrees monday morning in philadelphia and 31 on sunday morning in pittsburgh .	tyburski says spring variations are normal from year to year .	philadelphia 's average last frost date varies from april 3 to april 27 .	temperatures across much of the state are expected to rise slightly this week , with lows in the 30s and 40s and highs in the 50s or low 60s .
more than a century ago , carry a. nation began her campaign against drinking by busting up saloons in kansas , which to this day has some of the strictest liquor laws in the country .	but even in the town where her legacy is enshrined , the influence of the hatchet-wielding crusader is waning .	residents in the town of medicine lodge , where nation lived for about a decade in the late 1800s and early 1900s and the site of the carry nation home museum , approved a measure this week to allow sunday liquor sales for the first time at least since prohibition .	the vote , which the county certified friday , allows the sale of beer and liquor on all sundays except easter .	in november 2010 , voters in barber county , where medicine lodge is located , also voted to legalize liquor by the drink in bars and restaurants .	some see the moves to make liquor more accessible as progress in a state that has yet to ratify the constitutional amendment ending prohibition .	others think the changes would enrage the town 's famous but long-dead resident . "	i suspect that carry nation is turning over in her grave , " said ann bell , a medicine lodge resident and a member of the board of directors of the museum . "	oh yeah .	i 'm sure she is .	she would not have appreciated the people of medicine lodge passing that vote that way because she was definitely not for the sale of alcohol any way , any day , any time . "	medicine lodge , a town of about 2,000 residents in south-central kansas , now has two liquor stores , bell said .	when the sunday sales begin ?	likely dec. 11 ?	nation " would have a trail made between the two of them trying to close those liquor stores down . " "	she 'd probably be out there sunday making sure nobody went in there , " bell said . "	she would be saying , ' well , i did all this work and now what 's happened ?	all of that has gone for naught .	now look at what you people have done ! "	kansas has a history of complicated , arcane liquor laws .	prohibition ended for the country in 1933 .	but the state did n't repeal statewide prohibition until 1948 and still has n't taken the formal step of ratifying the 21st amendment that ended prohibition nationally , according to the kansas division of alcoholic beverage control .	the state has 19 counties that do n't allow liquor sales by the drink .	kansas also limits retail liquor licenses to one per person and requires that person to have been a kansas resident for at least four years , according to the alcohol beverage control office .	kansas does allow grocery and convenience stores to sell " cereal malt beverage , " also known as " weak " or " low-point " beer , and is one of only five states to make such a distinction about beer based on alcohol content .	nation would storm bars in kansas with followers and break their liquor bottles .	her aim was to uphold the national and state laws that outlawed the sale and manufacture of liquor .	she eventually brought her crusade to missouri , where she is buried in the kansas city suburb of belton .	her attacks , which garnered a great deal of publicity , " made a certain degree of sense , " said blair tarr , curator at the kansas historical society . "	how do you get arrested for doing something against something that was n't supposed to exist , " tarr said .	he said nation , who spelled her name " carrie " earlier in life , preferred the spelling " carry " once she became a prohibition zealot and often said that prohibition " would carry a nation . "	rita wert , the current president of the women 's christian temperance union , said in an email that she was " disappointed " in the medicine lodge vote . "	i stick to my guns behind the statement i have shared very publicly , ' easier to get alcohol , makes it easier to get drunk , ' " wert said .	but maj. robert stutler , mayor of medicine lodge , supported the measure and said the local law " mimics " state law .	since 2005 kansas has allowed each city and county to decide whether to allow sunday sales . "	carry nation is history , " said stutler , a retired marine . "	whether it passed or failed , i do n't think it would change the habits of our residents one iota .	... i do n't look at this as being that monumental .	i think it 's just a matter of us doing business as normal . "	stutler said that allowing liquor sales on sunday is a good marketing move for a town that has been trying to improve tourism . "	i do n't want us to appear not forward-thinking or appear backward , " he said . "	i see no purpose on imposing unnecessary restrictions on visitors . "	tarr said although he suspects nation " would be sorely disappointed with us " because of the vote , he thinks if she were alive now nation would find other pressing issues to battle . "	the drug problem ... i think she 'd go after that too , " tarr said .

for the second time in as many years , an oklahoma jury has convicted a former state lawmaker of a crime arising from his alleged conduct while in office .	last year , former state senate president pro tem mike morgan was convicted on a federal bribery charge that accused him of taking a $ 12,000 bribe in exchange for his influence on legislation .	on tuesday , former state rep. randy terrill was convicted on a state bribery charge that accused him of offering a legislative colleague a state job in exchange for her promise not to seek re-election .	that colleague , former state sen. debbe leftwich , is scheduled to go on trial on a related bribery charge next month .	she has pleaded not guilty .	amid the scrutiny , members of the state house and senate are considering whether the way they conduct the people 's business and the multiple prosecutions will chill legislative debate and action . "	i think what it says to anybody is that transparency and playing by the rules is the first order of business , " said rep. richard morrissette , d-oklahoma city . "	everything should be done within the letter of the law . "	there has been lots of discussion that this may or may not have a chilling effect .	i do n't think that it will . "	morrissette 's comments were echoed by other lawmakers who said the criminal cases involving their former colleagues should not affect their public responsibilities . "	i certainly do n't have those concerns , " said rep. paul wesselhoft , r-moore . "	i think that we 're doing our duty in serving our constituents .	i have not heard anyone express concern about proposing legislation that might jeopardize them in some legal way . "	rep. jeff hickman , r-dacoma , said the prosecutions are " a message to those who might operate on the margins . " "	we really need to be very serious about the way we conduct business at the capitol , " hickman said .	sen. clark jolley , r-edmond , said the allegations of official wrongdoing are also a warning to state lawmakers to do a better job of cleaning up their own houses . "	the allegations that were made should be prosecuted , " jolley said . "	my only regrets would be when a prosecutor finds it and the body does not on its own . "	evidence of wrongdoing against a lawmaker should be thoroughly investigated to determine if the member should be removed from office and then referred for prosecution , he said . "	i think it 's the responsibility of a body to clean its own house , " jolley said .	a house committee was formed to investigate terrill 's activities after the charges were filed .	in 2011 , the committee declined to take any action .	morgan , d-stillwater , was sentenced to five years ' probation after being convicted of taking a $ 12,000 bribe from an assisted-living center in exchange for attempting to influence legislation that would have eased regulations on the state 's nursing home industry .	a jury acquitted him of related extortion and mail fraud counts and could not reach a verdict on other counts .	morgan is appealing his conviction and maintains the money was actually payment of his legal fees .	terrill , r-moore , allegedly offered to put leftwich in an $ 80,000-a-year job at the medical examiner 's office if she would agree to not seek re-election in 2010 so a republican colleague of terrill 's could run for her open seat .	terrill testified in his own defense during his trial , claiming he did not offer leftwich a job and that she never asked him for one .	he was convicted of offering a bribe for withdrawal of candidacy , and his jury recommended that he serve one year in prison and pay a $ 5,000 fine .	leftwich is accused of soliciting a bribe for withdrawal of candidacy .	jury selection for her trial is scheduled to begin on dec. 9 .	the criminal trials have focused attention on how the oklahoma legislature conducts its business , but lawmakers said it has also raised other issues .	rep. mike reynolds , r-oklahoma city , said terrill 's conviction was due in part to a state law that defines a candidate for public office as a person who has raised or spent campaign funds .	leftwich had raised campaign funds for the 2010 election but she never filed as a candidate . "	the impact should be that the legislature ought to clarify the law , " reynolds said . "	i think that the idea that you become a candidate when you put together a campaign committee is inappropriate . "	he said state campaign records include dozens of examples of people who formed campaign committees that are dormant . "	sometimes people put together a committee and they do n't raise any money , " reynolds said .	some potential candidates change their mind after a campaign committee is formed or decide to run for another office , he said .	wesselhoft said the criminal prosecutions are part of a wider discussion among house republicans about the increasing role of courts in state government . "	we think the courts are a little out of control , " wesselhoft said . "	they 've kind of become a ' super legislature . ' "	in june , the oklahoma supreme court struck down civil justice reform legislation adopted in 2009 that was a priority for republican legislative leaders .	the high court said the law was unconstitutional because it contained multiple subjects in violation of the state constitution 's rule that requires legislation to cover just one subject .	the legislature approved a series of individual bills that reinstated the civil justice law during a special session in september .	in august , an oklahoma county judge blocked a new state law that would make it harder for women to obtain the morning-after pill , one of a number of anti-abortion related measures approved by the gop-controlled legislature that have been struck down as unconstitutional in recent years .	also in august , a federal judge prohibited oklahoma officials from certifying the results of a 2010 statewide election that approved a constitutional amendment to prohibit state courts from considering international or islamic law when deciding cases .	state question 755 was passed with 70 percent of the votes in a statewide election .

a kansas doctor wo n't have to post a bond while appealing the revocation of her medical license over referrals of young patients to the late dr. george tiller for late-term abortions , a judge ruled friday .	the state board of healing arts wanted to require dr. ann kristin neuhaus to put up a bond of nearly $ 93,000 as she pursues a lawsuit in shawnee county district court in hopes of regaining her license .	but district judge franklin theis rejected the request and is requiring only that neuhaus sign a statement saying she 'll pay any judgment imposed by the courts .	the board took away neuhaus ' license in june , ratifying an administrative judge 's finding that she did not perform adequate mental health exams on 11 patients , ages 10 to 18 , before referring them in 2003 to tiller 's clinic in wichita for late-term abortions .	neuhaus provided second medical opinions required by kansas law for such procedures .	neuhaus , who is from nortonville , about 30 miles north of lawrence , strongly disputes the board 's conclusions and contends her exams met accepted standards of care .	her attorneys told theis that as long as she can not practice medicine , the largest bond she can afford to post is perhaps $ 100 and granting the board 's request would deny her legal right to appeal its decision . "	only the wealthy would have access to the courts , " said kori trussell , one of neuhaus ' attorneys .	kelli stevens , the board 's general counsel , said that if the board has no guarantee that neuhaus will cover the expenses generated by her case , it might have to absorb those costs .	stevens noted that the board 's $ 4.3 million annual budget is financed by fees from the health care providers it licenses . "	it would be unfair for them to bear the cost of her wrongdoing , " stevens said .	but theis pointed out that the board itself said in its revocation order that it would n't require neuhaus to pay any costs until a court challenge was resolved .	also , stevens acknowledged that she knows of no case in which the board sought such a bond in the 13 years she 's worked for it .	theis said in his 36 years as a judge , he can not recall a case , either .	still , the judge 's decision is likely to upset abortion opponents who 've been watching neuhaus for years and pressing the board to impose sanctions against her . "	the awful irony is the court is bending over backward to insure an abortionist is not denied the due process that thousands of unborn children and their mothers were denied in kansas abortion clinics , " said kathy ostrowski , legislative director for kansans for life , who attended theis ' brief hearing friday .	neuhaus had an inactive medical license that allowed her to provide limited charity care .	she had asked the board to reinstate her to a full , active license .	she provided second opinions for tiller from 1999 to 2006 .	he was among a few u.s. physicians known to perform abortions in the final weeks of pregnancy , and he was shot to death in his church in may 2009 by a man professing strong anti-abortion views .	the disciplinary case against neuhaus examined how she concluded that each of the patients had serious mental health issues and that an abortion was advisable .	the law at the time required tiller to obtain an independent second opinion that a patient faced significant and permanent harm if the pregnancy continued .

a second american aid worker infected with ebola arrived tuesday in atlanta , where doctors will closely monitor the effect of an experimental drug she agreed to take even though its safety was never tested on humans .	nancy writebol arrived from monrovia , liberia , in a chartered plane at dobbins air reserve base and will join dr. kent brantly in the isolation unit at emory university hospital , just downhill from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention .	both were infected despite taking precautions as they treated ebola patients in west africa , where the virus has been spreading faster than governments can contain it , killing nearly 900 people so far .	and while family members said both americans have been improving after taking this novel serum , doctors at emory have released no details about their treatment .	writebol 's employer , the sim charity , said tuesday that she remains in serious but stable condition .	the serum was developed with u.s. military funding by a san diego company , using antibodies harvested from mice that had been injected with parts of the ebola virus .	tobacco plants in kentucky are being used to reproduce it .	it 's impossible to know if this treatment saved these workers from the hemorrhagic fever killing as many as 80 percent of the people the virus is infecting in africa .	they could be recovering on their own , or for other reasons , including the better medical care that u.s. hospitals routinely provide .	brantly , 33 , and writebol , 59 , were working at a missionary clinic outside liberia 's capital .	the world 's largest ebola outbreak has now spread to guinea , sierra leone and nigeria 's capital of lagos , where millions live in densely crowded conditions .	there is no vaccine or specific treatment for ebola , but several are under development , including zmapp , made by mapp biopharmaceutical inc. of san diego .	it works by boosting the immune system 's efforts to fight the virus .	the u.s. defense threat reduction agency announced on july 22 that it is providing more funding to speed the serum 's development , including a critical application with the food and drug administration and the production of enough of the serum to carry out human trials .	even if that process is successful , any wider use of the serum remains many months away .	but when the americans fell sick , the charity brantly works for , samaritan 's purse , did n't wait .	it reached out to emory , whose doctors contacted the drug 's producers .	the serum was flown to africa , and both patients got some before the long flight to atlanta on a plane that could only carry one of them at a time .	fda permission must be obtained before any experimental treatments in the united states , but other countries are beyond the fda 's authority , and these aid workers were first treated in liberia .	the fda has declined to comment on their treatment .	ebola is spread by close contact with blood and other bodily fluids , and writebol 's duties included disinfecting doctors and nurses entering or leaving the ebola treatment area .	her son , jeremy writebol , said he hopes her case " might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering . "	the virus is much less deadly when patients get top-flight care , experts say .	the cdc has been criticized for not objecting to the arrival of ebola victims on u.s. soil , but the agency 's director , dr. tom frieden , has emphasized that there is no threat of an outbreak spreading in the united states .	writebol and brantly will be sealed off from anyone who is n't wearing protective gear .	dr. bruce ribner , who will be treating them , said their families can speak with them through a plate-glass window .	but ribner said any modern u.s. hospital could safely treat these patients using standard infection-control procedures .	at least five other deadly hemorrhagic fevers have been handled at u.s. hospitals lacking such sophisticated isolation units , experts have said .	emory 's unit , one of four in the country , was built in partnership with the cdc .	in 2005 it handled patients with sars , a viral respiratory illness that spreads when carriers cough or sneeze .

"	i am deeply sorry , " he said . "	i wish i could take it all back . "	his attorney , suzanne moushegian , said bricker did not benefit from curran 's death , refusing the $ 5,000 curran offered him , and he also lost his job with the navy . "	he 's being penalized for being young and naive and making big mistakes , " moushegian said . "	but he is not evil .	he did not do it with malice .	he was trying to help . "	curran 's wife , dawn curran , said bricker should have reported curran 's death request . "	that 's what a real friend would do , " she said , reading from a prepared statement and crying . "	i find assisted suicide equivalent to murder . "	curran had two sons , she said .	judge h. thomas padrick agreed , giving bricker the maximum sentence ?	10 years ?	- with five suspended .

the front wall of the old , wooden barn was buckled , and the roof was bowed .	it took two weeks just to straighten the structure .	but thanks to a $ 14,000 grant from the washington department of archaeology and historic preservation , the barn is standing tall again on the farm .	established in 2007 , the grant program assists with rehabilitation projects designed to stabilize and preserve designated heritage barns across the state .	washington lawmakers have appropriated $ 500,000 for the next two years to support the next round of the program , and the state is gearing up to accept applications . "	barns are iconic structures in our agricultural landscape , and farming is a huge part of our economy , " allyson brooks , department director said . "	this is our way of assisting our ag community , while preserving iconic structures on the landscape . "	the applications are competitive , and they must meet several criteria , including the historical significance of the barn , urgency of needed repairs and provisions for long-term preservation .	priority is given to barns that remain in agricultural use , and barn owners must match grant awards dollar for dollar .	stuart parrish worked full time for seven weeks , along with three others , to refurbish one of the family 's barns , which sits on one of four main drags into toppenish , a rural farm town south of yakima with the motto " where the west still lives . "	the parrish family has farmed in central washington 's yakima valley for decades ?	raising cattle and growing everything from grapes and hops to corn and mint ?	and worked the property associated with this particular barn for 30 years before buying it about six years ago .	the barn was in sad shape , parrish said .	while the family could have built a new barn more quickly and at roughly the same cost , they wanted to restore the historic structure that had seen so much over the years .	most recently , the 1920 barn stood in 3 feet of water during yakima valley flooding of 1996 . "	we tried to keep a lot of the details of the original barn , " he said . "	and people were really invested in the project , stopping by all the time to watch the work . "	parrish received a $ 14,000 grant for the project .	he estimates the total cost at around $ 45,000 .	washington boasts over 500 designated heritage barns in all 39 counties .	so far , the program has reviewed nearly 240 grant applications since its inception , and more than 46 barns have been refurbished .	for the $ 500,000 the state has to dole out every two years , the state department receives nearly $ 2 million in applications , brooks said . "	that shows a real need out there , " she said . "	you can not farm without a barn . "	and the money tends to stay in the local community , she said .	farmers buy local supplies and hire local laborers to do the work . "	for very little money , you 're getting all these great outcomes , " she said .	we 're hoping to continue to help our working farms .	it 's a great connection between agriculture and historic preservation . "	historic agricultural structures listed in the heritage barn register , the washington heritage register , or the national register of historic places , are eligible to receive grant funds .	to be eligible for listing in the heritage barn register , barns must be more than 50 years old and retain a significant degree of historic integrity .	grant applications are due oct. 28 , 2013 , with grant awards slated to be announced in early 2014 .

i know very well that many scientists consider dowsing as they do astrology , as a type of ancient superstition .	according to my conviction this is unjustified .	the dowsing rod is a simple instrument which shows the uncanny reaction of the human nervous system to certain factors which are unknown to us at this time . " ?	albert einstein for much of four decades , harold mccoy walked the hills and valleys of northwest arkansas with a forked stick in his hand .	like generations before him , mccoy walked with a specific goal in mind ?	to find water , enough to meet the needs of a family .	when the stick tipped itself from horizontal to vertical , he knew he 'd found what he sought . "	my husband was a dowser , " mccoy 's wife , gladys , said proudly . "	i did n't know it until he retired from the military , and we needed a water source on our property . "	he walked across our yard and found us a place to drill a well , " she remembered . "	it 's still producing after 40-some years . "	when harold mccoy died in july 2010 , his widow followed in his footsteps ?	literally ?	taking over the ozark research institute he founded in fayetteville in 1992 and " water witching " for families in need . "	i learned to dowse basically by hanging out with him , helping him , watching him , " gladys mccoy said . "	i did believe in dowsing ; i had no doubt that it worked .	it 's not an unbelievable thing that you could find water , gas , oil , whatever , in an underground area , because it 's been done for eons . "	the practice of dowsing is thought to date as far back as ancient egypt , where tomb paintings show a pharaoh with what might be a dowsing rod , according to the american society of dowsers , and it 's mentioned in the bible . "	many passages in the bible allude to dowsing , relating in considerable detail how both moses and his son , aaron , used a dowsing device referred to as ' the rod ' to locate and bring forth water , " lloyd youngblood writes on the asd website . "	in the old testament , the prophet ezekiel reports king nebuchadnezzar of babylon , uncertain as to which city he should attack ?	jerusalem , the capital of judah , or rebath of the ammonites ( today 's modern-day amman , jordan ) ?	directed his dowsers or diviners to select the best target . "	in the ozarks , dowsers like the mccoys are best known for seeking water , and that 's the need that keeps gladys mccoy working . "	you know , there are places still in arkansas where they do n't have rural water ; you ca n't just turn that tap on , " she said . "	when someone tells you they 've been hauling water for over 25 years and now they 've got good , clean , sweet , potable water ?	and all they need ?	right there !	that 's what i do and what i love doing . "	of course , there are skeptics , but a november 1998 article in popular mechanics states science might be on the dowsers ' side . "	researchers analyzed the successes and failures of dowsers in attempting to locate water at more than 2000 sites in arid regions of sri lanka , zaire , kenya , namibia and yemen over a 10-year period , " the magazine reported . "	to do this , researchers teamed geological experts with experienced dowsers and then set up a scientific c study group to evaluate the results .	drill crews guided by dowsers did n't hit water every time , but their success rate was impressive .	in sri lanka , for example , they drilled 691 holes and had an overall success rate of 96 percent . "	mccoy said anyone can dowse , " all you have to do is let go and allow it to work . "	you do n't know unless you 're an electrician how your refrigerator works , " she said . "	all you know is you plug it in and put it on the number 3 , and it works .	it 's the same way with the dowsing : you put the rods in your hands , ask the right question , clear your mind of any preconceived ideas , and the rod will respond . "	mccoy said all the time she 's walking , she 's talking , and she 's often asked by clients and observers to whom she 's speaking . "	i 'm talking to god , " she said simply . "	i ask god before i ever go out there to provide what this family needs , and i keep asking . "	not all of mccoy 's work is done in the field .	she 's in the office at the ozark research institute from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week , her daughter joyce said , counseling people who call in with all kinds of questions , from health concerns to relationship issues . "	my dad started out with the american society of dowsers , so his main interest was water , " joyce mccoy said . "	then he started learning all these different techniques , and he thought , ' why ca n't i help people with their healing ? ' "	a lot of people use it to answer questions and get information for healing .	they use it to find deficits in the energy fields of the body . "	her father , she said , then used meditative visualization techniques to move the energy and solve the problems . "	he was very intuitive , " she said , often discovering past issues that were causing ill health in the present . "	a lot of his teachings were based on letting go of all of that negativity from the past . "	dowsing , joyce mccoy said , is in danger of becoming a lost art in the ozarks , and that 's why the institute offers free classes to youngsters ages 10 to 18 every april . "	a lot of old-timers know about dowsing or water witching , but i 'm not sure the younger generation is quite as open to that right now , " she said . "	i find dowsing fascinating and believe it has a long and varied history , and ozark folkways believes in keeping the dying arts alive for future generations to use and enjoy , " said rebecca buchanan , director of ozark folkways in winslow .	that 's how gladys mccoy came to teach an afternoon class on dowsing there . "	i do dowsing because i feel like it 's a service , and i teach it because i want everybody to know how , " mccoy said . "	i truly believe the day is coming when we 'll all need to know how to find good potable water in the ground . "
an ohio woman 's quest for shared custody of a girl whose conception she planned with a same-sex partner ended in defeat tuesday , but experts say the ohio supreme court 's decision in her case leaves open the possibility of more legal co-parenting agreements in a state that has banned gay marriage .	in a 4-3 decision , the ohio supreme court ruled in favor of the child 's biological mother , kelly mullen , who claimed sole custody .	mullen 's former partner , michele hobbs , shared parenting and financial support of the girl , a 5-year-old named lucy , before the women split up in 2007 .	hobbs argued that the two jointly planned mullen 's pregnancy and documents ?	including a ceremonial birth certificate and will ?	listed hobbs as lucy 's " co-parent . "	she said that represented a binding contractual agreement between the women , and a magistrate who initially reviewed the evidence agreed .	but the high court on tuesday sided with a later decision to the contrary by the 1st district court of appeals .	justice robert cupp , writing for the majority , acknowledged that hobbs presented significant evidence to support her claim to partial custody , but he said mullen produced opposing evidence . "	the court noted that all the documents created by mullen which purported to give hobbs some custodial responsibilities not only were revocable , but were , in fact , revoked by mullen , " he wrote . "	testimony supported mullen 's statement that she did not intend to relinquish sole custody of the child to hobbs . "	mullen 's attorney douglas dougherty said the case had nothing to do with the women 's sexual orientation . "	my client is a lesbian and proud of it , and she thinks lesbians should have all the rights that straight people have , and so do i , " he said . "	the problem here was n't that it was a lesbian or gay relationship , it was that they did n't love each other anymore , and very sadly did n't respect each other anymore , and my client felt a clean break was in the best interest of the child . "	chief justice maureen o'connor , yvette mcgee brown and paul pfeifer dissented in the case .	o'connor 's opinion , joined by mcgee brown , said the court was wrong to accept the case in the first place because it established no new governing principle .	one thing it did show , she said : couples would be prudent to get custody arrangements in writing .	ohio state university law professor marc spindelman said justices seemed to be largely in agreement on that point , and that could have broad implications for unmarried couples ohio .	he said the majority opinion was carefully framed around the facts of the case , especially hobbs ' lack of a written shared custody agreement . "	it 's not insignificant , and it 's important to remember , that the majority 's opinion provides a way to resolve that dilemma , " he said . "	it puts power in hands of people who are co-parenting a child to put in place shared custody agreements , and to do that within the law . "	ohioans voted in favor of a gay marriage ban in 2004 that stripped same-sex couples of many legal protections , and spindelman said " lots of people believed the outcome of this case would mark not only a defeat for this particular woman but a major lesbian and gay rights in the state of ohio . "	hobbs ' attorney , christopher clark of the gay-rights law project lambda legal , agreed ?	but he said it was still a devastating day for his client .	he said the rights of nonbiological parents , grandparents and other caretakers have been upheld in numerous other cases where there was much weaker evidence . "	when same-sex couples and the lgbt community are trying to seek legal protections , it is often the response , ' why do you need the law to change , because you can just go to a lawyer and draw up the paperwork you need to protect yourself ? ' "	he said . "	this case , unfortunately , highlights that you can do everything possible to protect your family and your children and the system can break down . "	in his dissent , pfeifer said hobbs presented more than enough evidence to back up her claim . "	can an agreement that another person is a co-parent in every way possibly not include a right to custody ?	it can not .	the trial court seems to agree , and thus turns its emphasis on the fact that the documents were revocable , " he wrote . "	but the question before the court was whether mullen agreed to share custody of her child with hobbs , not whether she eventually came to regret that decision . "
